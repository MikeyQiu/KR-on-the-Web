ABSTRACT
Hand gesture-to-gesture translation in the wild is a challenging
task since hand gestures can have arbitrary poses, sizes, locations
and self-occlusions. Therefore, this task requires a high-level un-
derstanding of the mapping between the input source gesture
and the output target gesture. To tackle this problem, we pro-
pose a novel hand Gesture Generative Adversarial Network (Ges-
tureGAN). GestureGAN consists of a single generator G and a
discriminator D, which takes as input a conditional hand image
and a target hand skeleton image. GestureGAN utilizes the hand
skeleton information explicitly, and learns the gesture-to-gesture
mapping through two novel losses, the color loss and the cycle-
consistency loss. The proposed color loss handles the issue of “chan-
nel pollution” while back-propagating the gradients. In addition,
we present the Fréchet ResNet Distance (FRD) to evaluate the qual-
ity of generated images. Extensive experiments on two widely
used benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed Gesture-
GAN achieves state-of-the-art performance on the unconstrained
hand gesture-to-gesture translation task. Meanwhile, the gener-
ated images are in high-quality and are photo-realistic, allowing
them to be used as data augmentation to improve the performance
of a hand gesture classifier. Our model and code are available at

1 INTRODUCTION
Hand gesture-to-gesture translation in the wild is a task that con-
verts the hand gesture of a given image to a target gesture with a
different pose, size and location while preserving the identity infor-
mation. This task has many applications, such as human-computer
interactions, entertainment, virtual reality and data augmentation.
However, this task is difficult since it needs (i) handling complex
backgrounds with different illumination conditions, objects and
occlusions; (ii) a high-level semantic understanding of the mapping
between the input and output gestures.

Recently, Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) [7] have
shown the potential to solve this challenging task. GAN is a gener-
ative model based on game theory, which has achieved impressive
performance in many applications, such as high-quality image
generation [12], video generation [56] and audio generation [30].
To generate specific kinds of images, videos and audios, Mirza et
al. [28] proposed the Conditional GAN (CGAN), which comprises a
vanilla GAN and other external information, such as class labels [3],
text descriptions [37], images [10] and object keypoints [37].

In this paper, we focus on the image-to-image translation task
using CGAN. Image-to-image translation tasks can be divided into
two types: paired [10, 24, 41] and unpaired [1, 3, 58, 62]. However,
existing image-to-image translation frameworks are inefficient in
the multi-domain image-to-image translation task. For instance,
given m image domains, pix2pix [10] and BiCycleGAN [63] need to

and DualGAN [58] need to train C
m(m−1) generator/discriminator pairs since one model has 2 dif-
ferent generator/discriminator pairs for these methods. Combo-
GAN [1] requires m=Θ(m) models. StarGAN [3] needs one model.
However, for some specific image-to-image translation applications
such as hand gesture-to-gesture translation, m could be arbitrary
large since gestures in the wild can have arbitrary poses, sizes,
appearances, locations and self-occlusions.

To address these limitations, several works have been proposed
to generate images based on object keypoints. For instance, Reed
et al. [36] present an extension of Pixel Convolutional Neural Net-
works (PixelCNN) to generate images based on keypoints and text
description. Siarohin et al. [41] introduce a deformable Generative
Adversarial Network for pose-based human image generation. Ma
et al. [25] propose a two-stage reconstruction pipeline that learns
generates novel person images. However, the aforementioned meth-
ods always have the “channel pollution” problem that is frequently
occurring in generative models such as PG2 [24] leading to blurred
generated images. To solve this issue, in this paper, we propose

a novel Generative Adversarial Network, i.e., GestureGAN which
treats each channel independently. It allows generating high-quality
hand gesture images with arbitrary poses, sizes and locations in the
wild, and thus reducing the dependence on environment and pre-
processing operations. GestureGAN only consists of one generator
and one discriminator, taking a conditional hand gesture image and
a target hand skeleton image as inputs. In addition, to better learn
the mapping between inputs and outputs, we propose two novel
losses, i.e., color loss and cycle-consistency loss. Note that the color
loss can handle the problem of “channel pollution”, making the
generated images sharper and having higher quality. Furthermore,
we propose the Fréchet ResNet Distance (FRD), which is a novel
evaluation metric to evaluate the generated image of GANs. Exten-
sive experiments on two public benchmark datasets demonstrate
that GestureGAN can generate high-quality images with convinc-
ing details. Thus, these generated images can augment the training
data and improve the performance of hand gesture classifiers.
Overall, the contributions of this paper are as follows:

• We propose a novel Generative Adversarial Network, i.e., Ges-
tureGAN, which can generate target hand gesture with arbitrary
poses, sizes and locations in the wild. In addition, we present a
novel color loss to learn the hand gesture-to-gesture mappings,
handling the problem of “channel pollution”.

• We propose an efficient Fréchet ResNet Distance (FRD) metric to
evaluate the similarity of the real and generated images, which
is more consistent with human judgment. FRD measures the
similarity between the real image and the generated image in a
high-level semantic feature space.

• Qualitative and quantitative results demonstrate the superiority
of the proposed GestureGAN over the state-of-the-art models on
the unconstrained hand gesture-to-gesture translation task. In
addition, the generated hand gesture images are of high-quality
and are photo-realistic, thus allowing them to be used to boost
the performance of hand gesture classifiers.

2 RELATED WORK
Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) [7] is an unsupervised
learning method and has been proposed by Goodfellow et al. Re-
cently, GAN has shown outstanding results in various applications,
e.g., image generation [2, 12], image editing [33, 40], video gener-
ation [26, 48], texture synthesis [17], music generation [57] and
feature learning [54]. Recent approaches employ the idea of GAN
for conditional image generation, such as image-to-image transla-
tion [10, 49], text-to-image translation [35, 59], image inpainting
[6, 19], image blending [52], image super-resolution [16], as well
as the applications of other domains like semantic segmentation
[23], object detection [18, 50], human parsing [21], face aging [20]
and 3D vision [31, 53]. The key point success of GANs in computer
vision and graphics is the adversarial loss, which allows the model
to generate images that are indistinguishable from real images, and
this is exactly the goal that many computer vision and graphics
tasks aim to optimize.
Image-to-Image Translation frameworks use input-output data
to learn a parametric mapping between inputs and outputs, e.g.,
Isola et al. [10] build the pix2pix model, which uses a conditional
GAN to learn a translation function from input to output image

domains. Taigman et al. [46] propose the Domain Transfer Network
(DTN) which learns a generative function between one domain and
another domain. Zhu et al. [62] introduce the CycleGAN frame-
work, which achieves unpaired image-to-image translation using
the cycle-consistency loss. Moreover, Zhu et al. [63] present the Bi-
cycleGAN model based on CycleGAN [62] and pix2pix [10], which
targets multi-modal image-to-image translation.

However, existing image-to-image translation models are inef-
ficient and ineffective. For example, with m image domains, Cy-
cleGAN [62], DiscoGAN [13], and DualGAN [58] need to train
2) generators and discriminators, while pix2pix

[10] and BicycleGAN [63] have to train A
m
ator/discriminator pairs. Recently, Anoosheh et al. proposed Com-
boGAN [1], which only need to train m generator/discriminator
pairs for m different image domains, having a complexity of Θ(m).
Additionally, Choi et al. [3] propose StarGAN, in which a single
generator and discriminator can perform unpaired image-to-image
translations for multiple domains. Although the computational
complexity of StarGAN is Θ(1), this model has only been validated
on the face attributes modification task with clear background and
face cropping. More importantly, for some specific image-to-image
translation tasks such as hand gesture-to-gesture translation task,
the image domains could be arbitrary large, e.g., gesture in the
wild can have arbitrary poses, sizes, appearances, locations and
self-occlusions. The aforementioned approaches are not effective
for solving these specific situations.
Keypoint/Skeleton Guided Image-to-Image Translation. To
fix these limitations, several recent works have been proposed to
generate person, bird or face images based on object keypoints
[24, 37] or human skeleton [41, 56]. For instance, Di et al. [5]
propose the Gender Preserving Generative Adversarial Network
(GPGAN) to synthesize faces based on facial landmarks. Reed et
al. [37] propose the Generative Adversarial What-Where Network
(GAWWN), which generates birds conditioned on both text descrip-
tions and object location. Ma et al. propose the Pose Guided Person
Generation Network (PG2) [24] and a two-stage reconstruction
pipeline [25], which achieve person-to-person image translation
using a conditional image and a target pose image (note that in
these two models images are pre-cropped). Reed et al. [36] present
an extension of Pixel Convolutional Neural Networks (PixelCNN)
to generate images parts based on keypoints and text description.
Sun et al. [45] propose a two-stage framework to perform head
inpainting conditioned on the generated facial landmark in the first
stage. Korshunova et al. [15] use facial keypoints to define the affine
transformations of the alignment and realignment steps for face
swap. Wei et al. [51] propose a Conditional MultiMode Network
(CMM-Net) for landmark-guided smile generation. Qiao et al. [34]
present the Geometry-Contrastive Generative Adversarial Network
(GCGAN) to generate facial expressions conditioned on geome-
try information of facial landmarks. Song et al. [44] propose the
Geometry-Guided Generative Adversarial Network (G2GAN) for
facial expression synthesis guided by fiducial points. Yan et al. [56]
propose a method to generate human motion sequence with simple
background using CGAN and human skeleton information. Siaro-
hin et al. [41] introduce PoseGAN for pose-based human image
generation using human skeleton.

Figure 1: Pipeline of the proposed GestureGAN model. GestureGAN consists of a single generator G and a discriminator D,
which takes as input a conditional hand image and a target hand skeleton image.

The typical problem with the aforementioned generative models
is that they suffer from “channels pollution” and thus they tend to
generate blurry results with artifacts. To handle this problem, we
propose GestureGAN, which allows generating high-quality hand
gesture image with arbitrary poses, sizes and locations in the wild.

defined by setting the pixels around the corresponding keypoint
(pi , qi ) to 1 (white) with the radius of 4 and 0 (black) elsewhere. In
other words, each keypoint is actually represented with pixels in a
circle with a radius of 4. Therefore, the total adversarial loss based
on hand keypoint can be defined as,

3 MODEL DESCRIPTION
3.1 GestureGAN Objective
The goal of vanilla GAN is to train a generator G which learns
the mapping between random noise z and image y. The mapping
function of GAN, G(z) (cid:55)→ y is learned via the following objective
function,

(1)

LG AN (G, D) = Ey [log D(y)] + Ez [log(1−D(G(z)))] .
Conditional GANs learn the mapping G(x, z) (cid:55)→ y, where x is the
input conditional image. Generator G is trained to generate image
(cid:98)y
that cannot be distinguished from “real” image y by an adversarially
trained discriminator D, while the discriminator D is trained as well
as possible to detect the “fake” images generated by the generator G.
The objective function of the conditional GAN is defined as follows,
LcG AN (G, D) = Ex,y [log D(x, y)] + Ex, z [log(1 − D(x, G(x, z)))] ,

where generator G tries to minimize this objective while the dis-
criminator D tries to maximize it. Thus, the solution is G∗ =
LcGAN (G, D). In this paper, we try to learn two map-
arg min
pings through one generator. The framework of the proposed Ges-
tureGAN is shown in Figure 1.
Adversarial Loss. In order to learn the gesture-to-gesture map-
ping, we employ the hand skeleton information explicitly. We
exploit OpenPose [42] to detect 21 hand keypoints denoted as
(pi , qi |i = 1, 2, · · · , 21), where pi and qi represent pixel coordi-
nates of keypoints. For each keypoint (pi , qi ), ci ∈[0, 1] represents
the confidence that the keypoint is correctly localized. Thus, the
adversarial losses of the two mappings G([x, Ky ], z1) (cid:55)→ y and
G([y, Kx ], z2) (cid:55)→ x are defined respectively, as follows:

LKy (G, D, Ky ) =E[x, Ky ],y
E[x, Ky ], z1

(cid:2)log D([x, Ky ], y)(cid:3) +
(cid:2)log(1 − D([x, Ky ], G([x, Ky ], z1)))(cid:3) ,

LKx (G, D, Kx ) =E[y, Kx ], x [log D([y, Kx ], x )] +

E[y, Kx ], z2 [log(1 − D([y, Kx ], G([y, Kx ], z2)))] ,

where Ky and Kx are the hand keypoints of image y and x respec-
tively; [·, ·] represents the concatenate operation. Ky and Kx are

(3)

(4)

LK (G, D, Kx , Ky ) = LKy (G, D, Ky ) + LKx (G, D, Kx ).
In addition, to explore the influence of the confidence score ci
to the generated image, we define a confidence keypoint image (cid:98)K
in which the pixels around the corresponding keypoint (pi , qi ) are
set to ci in a radius of 4 pixels and 0 (black) elsewhere. Thus, Equa-

tion 5 can be expressed as L

(G, D, (cid:99)Kx , (cid:99)Ky ) = L

(cid:99)Kx
Moreover, following OpenPose [42], we connect the 21 keypoints
(hand joints) to obtain the hand skeleton, denoted as Sx and Sy .
The hand skeleton image visually contains richer hand structure
information than the hand keypoint image. Next, the adversarial
loss based on hand skeleton can be derived from Equation 5, i.e.,
LS (G, D, Sx , Sy ) = LSy (G, D, Sy ) + LSx (G, D, Sx ). In hand skele-
ton image Sx and Sy , the hand joints are connected by the lines
with the width of 4 and with white color. Next, corresponding to
the confidence keypoint image, we have also defined an adver-
(G, D, (cid:99)Sx , (cid:98)Sy ) =
sarial loss using confidence hand skeleton as L
(cid:98)S
(G, D, (cid:99)Sx ), where the line connections in (cid:99)Sx
L
and (cid:98)Sy are filled with the confidence score of later point, e.g., if the
hand skeleton connects points 1 and 2, thus this line connection is
filled with the confidence of point 2, i.e., c2 with the width of 4.
Improved Pixel Loss. Previous work indicated that mixing the
adversarial loss with a traditional loss such as L1 loss [10] or L2
loss [32] between the generated image and the ground truth image
improves the quality of generated images. The definition of L1 and
L2 losses are:

(G, D, (cid:98)Sy ) + L

(cid:99)Sx

(cid:99)Sy

(cid:2) ∥x − G([y, Sx ], z2) ∥{1, 2}

However, we observe that the existing image-to-image transla-
tion models such as PG2 [24] cannot retain the holistic color of
the input images. An example is shown in Figure 2, where PG2
is affected by the pollution issue and produces more unrealistic
regions. Therefore, to remedy this limitation we introduce a novel
channel-wise color loss. Traditional generative models convert a
whole image to another, which leads to the “channel pollution”

ferent methods.

problem. However, the color loss treats r , д and b channels indepen-
dently and generates only one channel each time, and then these
three channels are combined to produce the final image. Intuitively,
since the generation of a three-channel image space is much more
complex than the generation of a single-channel image space, lead-
ing to higher possibility of artifacts, we independently generate
each channel. The objective of r , д and b channel losses can be
defined as follows,

where c∈{r , д, b}, xr , xд and xb denote the r , д and b channels of
image x respectively and similar to yr , yд and yb , ∥· ∥1 and ∥· ∥2
represent L1 and L2 distance losses. Thus, the color L1 and L2 losses
can be expressed as,

When back-propagating the gradients of the L1 loss, the partial
derivatives are constants, i.e., ±1. Therefore, the error from other
channels will not influence the current one as the derivative is a
constant. However, for the original L2 loss, the derivative is not
a fixed constant. Actually, the derivative for the variables in one
channel is always influenced by the errors from other channels. We
have listed the gradients of red channel of Equations 6 and 8. Let

Clearly, in Equation 9 the red channel in original L2 loss is pol-
luted by green and blue channels. As a consequence, the error from
other channels will also influence the red channel. On the contrary,
if we compute the loss for each channel independently, we can
avoid such influence as shown in Equation 10.
Cycle-Consistency Loss. It is worth noting that the CycleGAN [62]
is different from pix2pix framework [10] as the training data in Cy-
cleGAN is unpaired. The CycleGAN introduces the cycle-consistency
loss to enforce forward-backward consistency. The cycle-consistency
loss can be regarded as “pseudo” pairs of training data even though
we do not have the corresponding data in the target domain which
corresponds to the input data from the source domain. However, in
this paper we introduce the cycle-consistency loss for the paired
image-to-image translation task. The cycle loss ensures the consis-
tency between source images and the reconstructed image, and it
can be expressed as,

Lcyc (G, Sx , Sy ) =Ex,y, Sx , Sy , z1, z2
Ex,y, Sx , Sy , z1, z2

(cid:12)
(cid:2)(cid:12)
(cid:3) .
(cid:12)1
(cid:12)
(cid:12)
(13)
Similar to StarGAN [3] we use the same generator G two times,
with the first time to convert an original image into the target one,
then to recover the original image from the generated image.
Identity Preserving Loss. To preserve the person identity after
image synthesis, we propose the identity preserving loss, which
can be expressed as follows,

Lid ent i t y (G, Sx , Sy ) =Ex, Sy , z1
Ey, Sx , z2

(cid:12)
(cid:12)F (y) − F (G([x, Sy ], z1))(cid:12)
(cid:2)(cid:12)
(cid:12)
(cid:12)1
(cid:12)
(cid:12)
(cid:2) | |F (x ) − F (G([y, Sx ], z2))| |1

(cid:3) +
(cid:3) ,

(14)

where F is a feature extractor. The feature extractor employs a VGG
network [43] originally pretrained for face recognition. We mini-
mize the difference between the feature maps which are generated
from the real and the generated images via the pretrained CNN for
identity preservation.
Overall Loss. The final objective of the proposed GestureGAN is,

L =LS (G, D, Sx , Sy ) + λ1 LCol or{1, 2}

(G, Sx , Sy )+
λ2 Lcyc (G, Sx , Sy ) + λ3 Lid ent i t y (G, Sx , Sy ),

(15)

where, λ1 , λ2 and λ3 are three hyper-parameters controlling the
relative importance of these four losses. In our experiments, we
follow the same setup of pix2pix [10]. Instead of using the random
noise vector z, we provide noise only in the form of dropout in
generator G.

3.2 Network Architecture
Generator. We adopt the “U-shaped” network [10] as our generator.
U-net has skip connections, which concatenate all channels at layer
l with those at layer n−l, where n is the total number of layers.
Discriminator. We employ PatchGAN [10] as our discriminator
architecture. The goal of PatchGAN is to classify each small patch
in an image as real or fake. We run PatchGAN convolutationally
across an image, then average all results to calculate the ultimate
output of discriminator D.

3.3 Optimization
We follow the standard optimization method from [7] to optimize
the proposed GestureGAN, i.e., we alternate between one gradient
descent step on discriminator D, and one step on generator G. In ad-
dition, as suggested in the original GAN paper [7], we train to max-
imize log D([x, Sy ], (cid:98)y) rather than to minimize log(1 − D([x, Sy ], (cid:98)y)).
Moreover, in order to slow down the rate of D relative to G we
divide the objective by 2 while optimizing D,

L(D) =

We employ the minibatch SGD algorithm and apply Adam opti-
mizer [14] as solver. The momentum terms β1 and β2 of Adam are
0.5 and 0.999, respectively. The initial learning rate for Adam is
0.0002.

4 EXPERIMENTS
4.1 Experimental Setup
Datasets. We evaluate the proposed GestureGAN on two public
hand gesture datasets: NTU Hand Digit [38] and Creative Senz3D
[27], which include different hand gestures. NTU Hand Digit dataset
[38] contains 10 hand gestures (e.g., decimal digits from 0 to 9) color
images and depth maps collected with a Kinect sensor under clut-
tered background. The total images in this dataset are 10 gestures
× 10 subjects × 10 times = 1000 images. All images are in 640×480
resolution. In our experiment, we only use the RGB images. We
randomly select 84,636 pairs, each of which is comprised of two
images of the same person but different gestures. 9,600 pairs are
randomly selected for the testing subset and the rest of 75,036 pairs
as the training set. Creative Senz3D dataset [27] includes static
hand gestures performed by 4 people, each performing 11 different
gestures repeated 30 times each in the front of a Creative Senz3D
camera. The overall number of images of this dataset is 4 subjects ×
11 gestures × 30 times = 1320. All images are in resolution 640×480.
In our experiment, we only use the RGB images. We randomly
select 12,800 pairs and 135,504 pairs as the testing and training set,
each pair being composed of two images of the same person but
different gestures.
Implementation Details. For both datasets, we do left-right flip
for data augmentation and random crops are disabled in this experi-
ment as was done in PG2 [24]. For the embedding method, skeleton
images are fed into an independent encoder similar to PG2 [24],
then we extract the fully connected layer feature vector to concate-
nate it with the image embedding at the bottleneck fully connected

layer. For optimization, models are trained with a mini-batch size of
8 for 20 epochs on both datasets. Hyper-parameters are set empiri-
cally with λ1=100, λ2=10. λ3 is 0.1 in the beginning and is gradually
increased to 0.5. At inference time, we follow the same settings of
PG2 [24], Ma et al. [25] and PoseGAN [41] to randomly select the
target keypoint or skeleton. GestureGAN is implemented using the
public deep learning framework PyTorch. To speed up the training
and testing processes, we use a Nvidia TITAN Xp GPU with 12G
memory.
Evaluation Metrics. Mean Squared Error (MSE), Peak Signal-to-
Noise Ratio (PSNR), Inception Score (IS) [39], Fréchet Inception
Distance (FID) [9] and the proposed Fréchet ResNet Distance (FRD)
are employed to evaluate the quality of generated images. FRD
approach provides an alternative method to quantify the quality
of synthesis and is similar to the Fréchet Inception Distance (FID)
proposed by [9]. FID is a measure of similarity between two datasets
of images. The authors in [9] have shown that the FID is more
robust to noise than IS [39] and correlates well with the human
judgment of visual quality [9]. To calculate FID [9] between two
image domains x and y, they first embed both into a feature space
F given by an Inception model. Then viewing the feature space as
a continuous multivariate Gaussian as suggested in [9], the Fréchet
distance between the two Gaussians to quantify the quality of the
data and the definition of FID can be expressed as:

FID(x, y) = ∥µx − µy ∥2
x ) and (µy , (cid:205)

2 ),

Unlike FID, which regards the datasets x and y as a whole, the pro-
posed FRD is inspired from feature matching methods [47, 60, 61],
and separately calculates the Fréchet distance between generated
images and real images from the semantical level. In this way, im-
ages from two domains do not affect each other when computing
the Fréchet distance. Moreover, for FID the number of samples
should be greater than the dimension of the coding layer, while
the proposed FRD does not have this limitation. We denote xi and
yi as images in the x and y domains, respectively. For calculating
FRD, we first embed both images xi and yi into a feature space F
with 1000×1 dimension given by a ResNet pretrained model [8]. We
then calculate the Fréchet distance between two feature maps f (xi )
and f (yi ). The Fréchet distance F (f (xi ), f (yi )) is defined as the
infimum over all reparameterizations α and β of [0, 1] of the max-
imum over all t ∈ [0, 1] of the distance in F between f (xi )(α(t))
and f (yi )(β(t)), where α and β are continuous, non-decreasing
surjections of the range [0, 1]. The proposed FRD is a measure of
similarity between the feature vector of the real image f (yi ) and
the feature vector of the generated image f (xi ) by calculating the
Fréchet distance between them. The Fréchet distance is defined as
the minimum cord-length sufficient to join a point traveling for-
ward along f (yi ) and one traveling forward along f (xi ), although
the rate of travel for each point may not necessarily be uniform.
Thus, the definition of FRD between two image domain x and y is,

FRD(x, y) =

4.2 Qualitative & Quantitative Results
Comparison against Baselines. We compare the proposed Ges-
tureGAN with the most related four works, i.e., PG2 [24], Yan et al.
[56], PoseGAN [41] and Ma et al. [25]. PG2 [24] and Ma et al. [25]
try to generate a person image with different poses based on a con-
ditional person image and a target keypoint image. Yan et al. [56]
and PoseGAN [41] explicitly employ human skeleton information
to generate person images. Note that Yan et al. [56] adopt a CGAN
to generate motion sequences based on appearance information
and skeleton information by exploiting frame level smoothness.
We re-implemented this model to generate a single frame for fair
comparison. These four methods are paired image-to-image models
and comparison results are shown in Figure 3 and Table 1. As we

can see in Figure 3, GestureGAN produces sharper images with
convincing details compared with other baselines. Moreover, it is
obvious that our results in Table 1 are consistently much better
than baseline methods on both datasets.
Generated Results of Each Epoch. Figure 5 (left) illustrates the
convergence loss L of the proposed GestureGAN in Equation 15.
Note that the proposed GestureGAN ensures a very fast yet stable
convergence.
Analysis of the Model Components. In Figure 4 we conduct
ablations studies of our model. We gradually remove components
of the proposed GestureGAN, i.e., Dual Discriminators (D), Iden-
tity Loss (I), Color Loss (P) and Cycle-consistency Loss (C). We
find that removing the color loss and the cycle-consistency loss

measurements except IS. The reason could be that the datasets we
used only include human images which do not fit into ImageNet
classes [4]. Moreover, PG2 [24] and other super-resolution works
such as [11] also show the fact that sharper results have a lower
quantitative value.
User Study. Similar to [24, 41, 62], we have also provided a user
study. We follow the same settings as in [10] to conduct the Amazon
Mechanical Turk (AMT) perceptual studies. The results of NTU
Hand Digit [22] and Senz3D [27] datasets compared with the base-
line models PG2 [24], Ma et al [25], Yan et al. [56] and PoseGAN
[41] are shown in Table 3. Note that the proposed GestureGAN con-
sistently achieves the best performance compared with baselines.
FID vs. FRD. We also compare the performance between FID and
the proposed FRD. The results shown in Table 4 and we can observe
that FRD is more consistent with the human judgment in Table 3
than the FID metric. Moreover, we observe that the difference in

substantially degrades results, meaning that the color loss and the
cycle-consistency loss are critical to our results. In addition, the
results without using the identity loss and the dual discriminators
slightly degrade performance. We also provide quantitative results
in Table 2, and we can see that the full version of GestureGAN
produces more photo-realistic results that other variants on two

FRD between GestureGAN and the other methods is not as obvious
as in the results from the user study in Table 3. The reason is
that FRD calculates the Fréchet distance between the feature maps
extracted from the real image and the generated image using CNNs
which are trained with semantic labels. Thus, these feature maps are
employed to reflect the semantic distance between the images. The
semantic distance between the images is not very large considering
they are all hands. On the contrary, the user study measures the
generation quality from a perceptual level. The difference on the
perceptual level is more obvious than on the semantic level, i.e., the
generated images with small artifacts show minor difference on the
feature level, while being judged with a significant difference from
the real images by humans.
Data Augmentation. The generated images are high-quality and
are photo-realistic, and these images can be used to improve the
performance of a hand gesture classifier. The intuition is that if the
generated images are realistic, the classifiers trained on both the
real images and the generated images will be able to boost the accu-
racy of the real images. In this situation, the generated images work
as augmented data. We employ a pretrained ResNet-50 model [8]
and feed the generated images to fine-tune it. For both datasets, we
make a split of 70%/30% between training and testing sets. Specif-
ically, the NTU Hand Digit dataset has 700 and 300 images for
training and testing set. For the Senz3D dataset, the numbers of
training and testing set are 924 and 396. The recognition results for
the NTU Hand Digit and the Senz3D datasets are 15% and 34.34%,
respectively. The term “real/real” in Table 5 represents the result
without data augmentation. After adding the generated images by
different methods to the training set, the performance improves sig-
nificantly. Results compared with PG2 [24], Yan et al. [56], Ma et al.
[25] and PoseGAN [41] are shown in Table 5. Clearly, GestureGAN
achieves the best result compared with baselines.
Influence of Gesture Size and Distance. We have also investi-
gated the influence of the gesture size and the distance between
source and target gestures. The training samples for the source and
the target gesture from the same person are randomly paired and
both gestures have different sizes and distances. Thus, the model

Figure 6: Two samples with different hand sizes and distances.

is able to learn a robust translation w.r.t different hand size and
distance. We show a qualitative example in Figure 6 in which the
source images have different sizes and the target gestures have
different locations. Note that GestureGAN can generate the target
gesture from different hand sizes and distances with high quality.
Influence of Gesture Pairs. To evaluate the influence of gesture
pairs, we searched all the translations between every possible cate-
gory combinations including the translation within each category.
In Figure 5 (right), we show the MSE for the translation from the
source to the target gesture types on NTU dataset. Note that the
MSE for the generation of different gesture pairs has a small vari-
ance, showing that the influence of different gesture pairs is very
low. This proves that our model is stable.

5 CONCLUSIONS
In this paper, we focus on a challenging task of hand gesture-to-
gesture translation in the wild. To this end, we propose a novel
Generative Adversarial Network (GAN), i.e., GestureGAN, which
can generate hand gestures with different poses, sizes and loca-
tions in the wild. We also propose two novel losses to learn the
mapping from the source gesture to the target gesture, i.e., the
color loss and the cycle-consistency loss. It is worth noting that the
proposed color loss handles the “channel pollution” problem while
back-propagating the gradients, which frequently occurs in the ex-
isting generative models. In addition, we present the Fréchet ResNet
Distance (FRD) metric to evaluate the quality of generated images.
Experimental results show that GestureGAN achieves state-of-the-
art performance. Lastly, the generated images of GestureGAN are
of high-quality and are photo-realistic, and they can thus be used to
improve the performance of hand gesture classifiers. Future work
will focus on designing a GAN model which can handle the situa-
tion where the background is total different between source and
target gestures.
