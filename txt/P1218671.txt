Abstract

This paper presents an approach combining lexico-semantic resources and distributed rep-
resentations of words applied to the evaluation in machine translation (MT). This study is
made through the enrichment of a well-known MT evaluation metric: METEOR. This metric
enables an approximate match (synonymy or morphological similarity) between an automatic
and a reference translation. Our experiments are made in the framework of the Metrics task of
WMT 2014. We show that distributed representations are a good alternative to lexico-semantic
resources for MT evaluation and they can even bring interesting additional information. The
augmented versions of METEOR, using vector representations, are made available on our
Github page.

1 Introduction

Learning vector representations of words using neural networks has generated a strong enthusiasm
in the NLP research community.
In particular, many contributions were proposed after the work of
(Mikolov et al., 2013a; Mikolov et al., 2013b; Mikolov et al., 2013c) on training word embeddings. The
main reasons for this strong interest are: the proposal of a simple and efﬁcient neural architecture to
learn word vector representations, the availability of an open source tool Word2Vec1 and the rapid struc-
turing of a user community2. Later on, several contributions have extended the work of Mikolov on word
vectors to phrases (sequences of words) (Mikolov et al., 2013b; Le and Mikolov, 2014a) and to bilingual
representations (Luong et al., 2015). All these vector representations capture similarities between words,
phrases or sentences at different levels (morphological, semantic).

However, although these representations can be semantically informative, they do not exactly replace
ﬁne-grained information available in lexical-semantic resources such as WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998), Ba-
belNet (Navigli and Ponzetto, 2010), or DBnary (Sérasset, 2012). Such lexical resources are also more
easily interpretable by humans as shown in (Panchenko, 2016), but their construction is costly while
word embeddings can be trained ad inﬁnitum on any monolingual or bilingual corpora.

In short, both approaches (lexical resources and word embeddings) have their pros and cons. However,
few studies have attempted to compare and combine them. Pioneering work of Faruqui et al. (2014)
proposed to reﬁne representations learning using lexical resources. The idea is to force words connected
in the lexical network, to have a close representation (for example through a synonymy link). The
technique proposed is evaluated on several benchmarks (word similarity, sentiment analysis, ﬁnding of
synonyms). More recently, Panchenko (2016) and Rothe and Schütze (2015) extended word embeddings
to sense embeddings and tried to compare them to lexical synsets.

Contributions: this article attempts to review the contribution of vector representations to measure
sentence similarity. We compare them with similarity measures based on lexical resources such as Word-
Net or DBnary. Machine Translation (MT) evaluation was identiﬁed as a particularly interesting applica-
tion to investigate, since MT evaluation is still an open problem nowadays. More precisely, we propose
to augment a well known MT evaluation metric (METEOR (Banerjee and Lavie, 2005)) which allows
an approximate matching (through synonymy or morphological similarity) between MT hypothesis and
reference. The augmented versions of METEOR proposed (using word embeddings, lexical resources or
both) allow us to objectively compare the contribution of each approach to measure sentence similarity.
For this, correlations between METEOR and human judgements (of MT outputs) are measured within
the framework of WMT 2014 Metrics task. The code of the augmented versions of METEOR is also
provided on our Github page3.

Outline: in section 2 (Related Work), we quickly present METEOR, lexical resources and word em-
beddings. Section 3 presents our propositions to augment METEOR in order to conduct a fair comparison
between lexical resources and vector representations respectively. Section 4 presents our experiments
made within the framework of WMT 2014, as well as quantitative and qualitative analyses. Finally,
section 5 concludes this work and gives some perpectives.

2 Related Work

2.1.1 The origins

2.1 An automatic metric for MT evaluation: METEOR

METEOR was proposed to compensate BLEU’s and NIST’s weaknesses (Papineni et al., 2002;
Doddington, 2002). In short, METEOR was created to better correlate with human judgements by using
more than word-to-word alignments between a hypothesis and some references. The alignment is made
according to three modules: the ﬁrst stage uses exact match between word surface forms (Exact mod-
ule), the second one compares word stems (Stems module) and the third one uses synonyms (Synonym
module) from a lexical resource such as WordNet (available for English only in METEOR).

One contribution of this paper is to propose an alternative to Stems and Synonym modules: our pro-

posed add-on will be called Vectors module later on.

2.1.2 Recent extensions of METEOR

METEOR-NEXT (Denkowski and Lavie, 2010a) was proposed to better correlate with HTER (Human-
targeted Translation Edit Rate – HTER (Snover et al., 2006)). HTER is a semi-automatic post-editing
based metric, which measures the edit distance between a hypothesis and a reference. METEOR-NEXT
proposes to go further than just word-to-word alignment by using phrase-to-phrase alignments. For this,
phrase databases were created for several languages like English (Snover et al., 2009), German, French
or Czech (Denkowski and Lavie, 2010b). More recently, another version called METEOR Universal
used bitexts to extract paraphrases (Denkowski and Lavie, 2014).

METEOR was also extended by using Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD)

techniques
(Apidianaki and Marie, 2015). The authors used Babelﬂy (Moro et al., 2014) for several langage pairs
(translation from French, Hindi, German, Czech and Russian to English). A better correlation with
human judgement at segment level was observed using WSD in METEOR.

Finally,

to extend the use of Synonym module to target

languages others than English,
Elloumi et al. (2015) proposed to replace WordNet by DBnary (Sérasset, 2012). The new target lan-
guages equipped with a Synonym module were French, German, Spanish, Russian and English.

2.2 Lexical resources

2.2.1 WordNet

WordNet is a well known lexical resource for English. Created at the University of Princeton
(Fellbaum, 1998), it is used in several NLP tasks such as Machine Translation, Word Sense Disam-

3https://github.com/cservan/METEOR-E

biguation, Cross-lingual Information Retrieval, etc. WordNet links nouns, verbs, adjectives and adverbs
to a set of synonyms called “synsets”. Each synset represents a speciﬁc concept.

Synsets are linked to each other according to semantic, conceptual and lexical relations. Words with
multiple meanings correspond to multiple synsets and meanings are sorted according to their frequency.
WordNet is available in several languages (Arabic, French, etc.) but these versions are not freely avail-
able. In METEOR, only English WordNet is used to match hypothesis and reference words according to
their meanings. It contains more than 117,000 synsets.

To extract lemmatized forms, METEOR uses a function called Morphy-7WN1 which ﬁrstly checks
special cases in an exception list and secondly uses rules to lemmatize words according to their syntactic
class.

2.2.2 DBnary

DBnary is a multilingual lexical resource in RDF format (Klyne and Carroll, 2004). This resource
has been collected by Sérasset (2012). Lexical data are represented using the LEMON vocabulary
(McCrae et al., 2011). Most Part-of-Speech tags are linked with Olia standards or Lexinfo vocabular-
ies (Chiarcos and Sukhareva, 2015; Cimiano et al., 2011) which makes them reusable in many contexts.
DBnary is downloadable or available online through a SPARQL access point. Lexical data are auto-

matically extracted from Wiktionary, Wikipedia’s dictionary for 21 languages4.

Table 1: Detail of the data used from DBnary for the languages targeted in this paper.

Among available lexical data, one may ﬁnd 2.9M lexical entries (with parts-of-speech, canonical form
for all of them, along with pronunciations when available and inﬂected forms for some languages).
Lexical entries are subdivided into 2.5M lexical senses (with their deﬁnitions and some usage example).
DBnary also contains more than 4.6M translations going from the 21 extracted sources languages
to more than 1500 different target languages. Additionally, DBnary contains lexicosemantic relations
(syno/anto-nyms, hypo/hypero-nyms, etc.). Table 1 shows the size of the data for languages involved in
the experiments later reported in this paper. Additional ﬁgures are available on the DBnary public web
site5.

Lemmatized forms for DBnary are based on the TreeTagger module (Schmid, 1995), which enables

us to ﬁnd the corresponding synsets.

2.3 Monolingual and bilingual embeddings

2.3.1 Overview

Learning word embeddings is an active research area (Bengio et al., 2003; Turian et al., 2010;
Collobert et al., 2011; Huang et al., 2012). The main idea is to learn a word representation according
to its context: the surrounding words (Baroni and Zamparelli, 2010). The words are projected on a con-
tinuous space and those with similar context should be close in this multi-dimensional space. When
word vectors are available, a similarity between two words can be measured by a metric such as a cosine
similarity.

Using word-embeddings for machine translation evaluation is appealing since they can be used to
compute similarity between words or phrases in the same language (monolingual embeddings capture
intrinsically synonymy or morphological closeness) or in two different languages (bilingual embeddings
allow to directly compute a distance between two sentences in different languages). We use the Mul-
tiVec (Bérard et al., 2016) toolkit for computing and managing the continuous representations of texts.

It includes word2vec (Mikolov et al., 2013a), paragraph vector (Le and Mikolov, 2014b) and bilingual
distributed representations (Luong et al., 2015) features.

2.3.2 Use of vector representations in NLP evaluation

Zou et al. (2013) proposed to use bilingual word embeddings to detect similarities for word alignment.
This information is used as an additional parameter in a phrase-based machine translation system.
(Banchs et al., 2015) proposed to explore a metric funded on latent semantic analysis (Salton et al., 1975)
to extract semantic embeddings and measure the similarity between two sentences. Finally, these
word embeddings were used to enrich ROUGE, a metric for evaluating automatic summarization
(Ng and Abrecht, 2015).

As far as MT evaluation is concerned, Gupta et al. (2015) proposed a metric based on neural net-
work language models jointly with dependency trees to link an hypothesis to a reference. Meanwhile,
Vela and Tan (2015) proposed an approach to model document embeddings to predict translation ade-
quacy.

These works are close to ours but they propose metrics which need to be learned and optimized to
a speciﬁc task or domain. In our work, we use word embeddings trained once and for all on a (large)
general corpus. Our detailed methodology to augment METEOR metric is presented in the next section.

sentence level by humans, compared to automatic metric ranking).

framework

(metrics

We augment METEOR in two ways: ﬁrstly, we replace the use of lexical resources by the use of
word embeddings. In other words, we replace Stem and Synonym modules by our new Vector module.
Secondly, we combine lexical resources and word embeddings by using jointly Stem, Synonym and our
Vector module.

To summarize, the following variants of METEOR are evaluated:

• METEOR Baseline: the METEOR score is estimated using Exact, Stem, Synonym and Paraphrase
modules for English as a target language and Exact, Stem and Paraphrase modules for other target
languages,

• METEOR DBnary: similar to METEOR Baseline but Synonym module is available for any target

language since it uses DBnary resource instead of Wordnet,

• METEOR Vector: the Stem and Synonym modules are replaced by the Vector module ;

• METEOR Baseline + Vector: the METEOR Baseline conﬁguration is augmented with the Vector

• METEOR DBnary + Vector:

module.

3.2 METEOR DBnary

As mentioned in section 2.1, the Synonym module of METEOR uses WordNet’s synsets (117K entries
for English). As an alternative, we use another lexical resource: DBnary (Sérasset, 2012), as proposed
recently by Elloumi et al. (2015). This allows us to use Synonym module for any target language: French,
German, Spanish, Russian and English.

More precisely, synonym relations are extracted from DBnary using SPARQL request on the DBnary
server6. We extract data for English, French, Russian and German languages. The extraction process
outputs relations in the following format: lemma → Synonym. Then, these data are projected to the
WordNet format used in METEOR code. This process gives an identiﬁer (ID) for each lemma and builds
a list of synonym IDs for each lemma such as: lemma → ID_Syn1, ID_Syn2, ID_Syn3.

The ﬁrst two lines of Table 3 compare METEOR DBnary and METEOR Baseline for several French-

English MT systems submitted to WMT14 (Bojar et al., 2014).

METEOR DBnary improved the score by 0.7 points from METEOR Baseline. In other words, DBnary
seems to match more synonyms than WordNet, despite the fact that WordNet is 3.3 time bigger than
DBnary in English. This could be due to the fact that WordNet has only 4 morpho-syntactic categories
(Noun, Verbs, Adjectives and Adverbs) while DBnary has more morpho-syntactic categories.

3.3 METEOR Vector

As mentioned in section 2.3.2, we propose to replace lexical resources by word embeddings. Word
embeddings capture the context of the words. Consequently, similar word vectors may correspond to
synonyms or morphological variants (see section 2.3).

Table 2: Bilingual corpora used to train the word embeddings for each language pair.

In our Vector module, the matching between two words is done using a similarity score derived from
the cosine similarity.
If the similarity score is higher than a threshold, the words are considered as
matched (potential synonyms or morphological proximity). In our experiments, we evaluate using: (a)
a default threshold ﬁxed to 0.80 (b) an oracle threshold obtained empirically on the WMT14 data set
(Machacek and Bojar, 2014).

Table 2 summarizes data used to train monolingual word embeddings and bilingual word embeddings.
These word embeddings were trained with a CBOW model, a vector size of 50 and a windows size ±5
words, thanks to the MultiVec toolkit (Bérard et al., 2016).

Table 3: METEOR scores (all conﬁgurations) on the newstest corpus of the WMT14 translation evalua-
tion task from French to English.

The results presented in table 3 show that word embeddings (Vector module) can efﬁciently replace
lexical resources (Synonym and Stem modules) to match words in the translation hypothesis with those
in the reference. In addition, their combination shows a good potential to match even more words be-
tween hypothesis and reference. In the next section, we evaluate if the proposed versions of augmented
METEOR better correlate with human judgements.

4 Correlations of Augmented METEOR with Human Judgements

4.1 Results of different METEOR conﬁgurations

In these experiments, we present results obtained with the Vector module based on two threshold values:
a default one (0.80) and an oracle one which maximizes the correlation with human judgement.

6http://kaiko.getalp.org/about-dbnary/online-access/

Table 4 presents the correlation scores obtained within the framework of WMT14 metrics task
(Machacek and Bojar, 2014)7. The evaluation is done according to several translation tasks: from En-
glish to French (en–fr), German (en–de) and Russian (en–ru), and vice versa. French, German and
Russian as target languages represent a growing difﬁculty due to their morphology. English as target
language allows to compare the lexical databases (Wordnet vs DBnary).

To English. Firstly, when the translation direction is to English, we can observe that METEOR Base-
line and METEOR Vector get equivalent results in average. METEOR DBnary also obtains similar results
to METEOR Baseline. When we combine WordNet lexical resource and word embeddings (METEOR
Baseline + Vector), the reference score is increased by 0, 005 points. If the combination is done with
DBnary’s lexical data (METEOR DBnary + Vector), the improvement is similar.

For Vector module, optimization of the threshold slightly improves the average correlation. Combina-
tion of METEOR Baseline + Vector or METEOR DBnary + Vector improves by 0, 002 points when the
threshold is optimized.

From English. Secondly, when the translation direction is from English, we can observe an improve-
ment of the correlation score obtained with METEOR DBnary, compared with METEOR Baseline. This
is due to the fact that for French, German and Russian as target languages, METEOR Baseline does not
use any Synonym module. Our METEOR Vector with the default threshold also gets better correlation
scores compared to METEOR DBnary (+0.003 points in average). The combinations METEOR Baseline
+ Vector and METEOR DBnary + Vector further improve correlations with human judgements (+0.001
points in average). Finally, when we use an oracle threshold for Vector module, improvements are bigger
and can reach 0.013 points in average, compared to METEOR Baseline.

Investigating more embeddings conﬁgurations

In the previous section, METEOR Vector used a simple and monolingual word embedding conﬁguration.
This section investigates more conﬁgurations (monolingual and bilingual) to improve METEOR.

In this experiment, we focus only on METEOR Vector. Indeed, the monolingual (baseline) shown in
table 6 corresponds to the line METEOR Vector in Table 4. Firstly, we propose to train our embeddings
on bitexts (Table 2) using bivec approach (Luong et al., 2015). We also try to train pseudo-bilingual
embeddings on a pseudo bitext with target language text and POS tags (see an example in Table 5).
The main idea is to strongly link words with their syntactic class when learning word embeddings. We
call this kind of model pseudo-bilingual with POS. In the same way, we train bilingual models called

Table 6: Average correlation score at segment level for METEOR Vector with several training conﬁgura-
tions of word embeddings with the default threshold (0.80).

In the Table 6, we compare several training conﬁguration of the word embeddings through the same
protocol as previous section (only average correlations are reported while the detailed results will be
provided as supplementary material on the paper web page). When we observe the average results, the
bilingual embeddings seem not to be as efﬁcient as the monolingual baseline. The pseudo-bilingual ap-
proaches with POS and Lemmas obtained slightly the same results as the monolingual baseline regarding
all the conﬁgurations we have. Finally, the monolingual model learned on lemmas (instead of words)
tends to be slightly better when the translation direction is to English. However, this trend should be
conﬁrmed in a future investigation.

4.3 Discussion

The correlation scores obtained with the enriched metric tend to suggest that distributed representations
are as powerful as lexico-semantic resources for automatic MT evaluation. Furthermore, vector repre-
sentations can bring additional information, and they are deﬁnitely useful when no lexical resource is
available in the target language.

Considering the average correlation scores obtained, the conﬁgurations METEOR Vector and ME-
TEOR DBnary are comparable, except on German language, for which METEOR Vector obtained a bet-
ter correlation score. On the other hand, when we combine lexical data with Vector module (METEOR
DBnary + Vector), we observe a small increase of the correlation score, in particular when threshold is
tuned, which suggests a tunable version of METEOR.

Finally, several embeddings variants were trained but it seems that monolingual models are efﬁcient

enough for the speciﬁc task (MT evaluation) considered here.

4.3.1 Examples
To illustrate the word matching obtained by our versions of METEOR, we analyze two examples from
the evaluation data set. In these examples, we present the alignments obtained with METEOR DBnary +
Vector.

Table 7: First example from the system rbmt 1 evaluated with the combination METEOR DBnary +
Vector. The relations detected with the lexical resource DBnary are framed in continuous line while
those obtained thanks to the distributed representations are framed in dotted line.

The example presented in table 7 shows rbmt 1 system output submitted during the WMT14 trans-
lation task. METEOR baseline found only alignments for words with the same surface forms (“qu’ ”,
“il”, “est”, etc. – these forms are found identical thanks to the Exact module and are not highlighted
here). The Synonym module based on DBnary makes it possible to ﬁnd a correspondence between words

“employées” – “utilisées” and “pour” – “dans”. Lastly, Vector module indicates that words “pense”
and “estime” are contextually closed, just as the words “je” and “j”’. When the example is only evalu-
ated with METEOR Vector, words “employées” and “utilisées” are also paired with the default threshold
(0.80). On the other hand, the words “bénéﬁce” and “intérêt” are paired by the module Vector only if
the decision threshold is lowered to 0.75.

Table 8: Another example scored with the combination METEOR DBnary + Vector.

In the second example presented in table 8, the hypothesis is provided by rbmt 4 system. As in the
previous example, the correspondences found with Synonym module based on DBnary (framed by one
continuous line) are supplemented by those found by Vector module (dotted line): Synonym module
found “créateur” – “père” and “faisait” – “faire”; while “du” and “de” are aligned thanks to Vector
module.

These examples illustrate the complementarity between lexical resources and word embeddings for
sentence similarity detection. Word vectors can enable to match important words (like “pense” and
“estime” in our ﬁrst example), but also empty words (like “du” et “de” in our second example).

4.3.2 Limitations of Word Embeddings
So far, we did not deal with Out-Of-Vocabulary (OOV) words in METEOR Vector. By OOV we mean
words that do not have a vector representation because they were not found in the training corpus for
word embeddings. In that case, no matching can occur between the word in the hypothesis and words in
reference. Consequently, it might be interesting to carefully select the training corpus for word vectors
so that it will be close enough to the machine translation outputs to evaluate. This could be considered
in future works.

5 Conclusion and Perspectives

In this paper, we proposed to compare text similarity measures based on vector representations with
similarity measures based on lexico-semantic resources. Our work was applied to machine translation
evaluation and we extended an existing evaluation metric called METEOR. Our experiments have shown
that word vector representations can be useful when no lexical resource is available in the target language.
Moreover, it seems that these representations can bring complementary information in addition to lexical
resources (experiments done for French, English, German and Russian as target languages).

Our future works on this topic will focus on the use of phrase embeddings to complement the Para-
phrase module of METEOR. We also plan to introduce a syntax ﬂavor in our Vector module by weighting
the cosine distances differently according to the morpho-syntactic category of the words. Finally, we will
study the adaptation of our approach to other metrics such as TER-Plus, for instance.

The tool, the data and the models presented in this paper will be put online8 to facilitate reproducibility

of the experiments we carried out.

Abstract

This paper presents an approach combining lexico-semantic resources and distributed rep-
resentations of words applied to the evaluation in machine translation (MT). This study is
made through the enrichment of a well-known MT evaluation metric: METEOR. This metric
enables an approximate match (synonymy or morphological similarity) between an automatic
and a reference translation. Our experiments are made in the framework of the Metrics task of
WMT 2014. We show that distributed representations are a good alternative to lexico-semantic
resources for MT evaluation and they can even bring interesting additional information. The
augmented versions of METEOR, using vector representations, are made available on our
Github page.

1 Introduction

Learning vector representations of words using neural networks has generated a strong enthusiasm
in the NLP research community.
In particular, many contributions were proposed after the work of
(Mikolov et al., 2013a; Mikolov et al., 2013b; Mikolov et al., 2013c) on training word embeddings. The
main reasons for this strong interest are: the proposal of a simple and efﬁcient neural architecture to
learn word vector representations, the availability of an open source tool Word2Vec1 and the rapid struc-
turing of a user community2. Later on, several contributions have extended the work of Mikolov on word
vectors to phrases (sequences of words) (Mikolov et al., 2013b; Le and Mikolov, 2014a) and to bilingual
representations (Luong et al., 2015). All these vector representations capture similarities between words,
phrases or sentences at different levels (morphological, semantic).

However, although these representations can be semantically informative, they do not exactly replace
ﬁne-grained information available in lexical-semantic resources such as WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998), Ba-
belNet (Navigli and Ponzetto, 2010), or DBnary (Sérasset, 2012). Such lexical resources are also more
easily interpretable by humans as shown in (Panchenko, 2016), but their construction is costly while
word embeddings can be trained ad inﬁnitum on any monolingual or bilingual corpora.

In short, both approaches (lexical resources and word embeddings) have their pros and cons. However,
few studies have attempted to compare and combine them. Pioneering work of Faruqui et al. (2014)
proposed to reﬁne representations learning using lexical resources. The idea is to force words connected
in the lexical network, to have a close representation (for example through a synonymy link). The
technique proposed is evaluated on several benchmarks (word similarity, sentiment analysis, ﬁnding of
synonyms). More recently, Panchenko (2016) and Rothe and Schütze (2015) extended word embeddings
to sense embeddings and tried to compare them to lexical synsets.

Contributions: this article attempts to review the contribution of vector representations to measure
sentence similarity. We compare them with similarity measures based on lexical resources such as Word-
Net or DBnary. Machine Translation (MT) evaluation was identiﬁed as a particularly interesting applica-
tion to investigate, since MT evaluation is still an open problem nowadays. More precisely, we propose
to augment a well known MT evaluation metric (METEOR (Banerjee and Lavie, 2005)) which allows
an approximate matching (through synonymy or morphological similarity) between MT hypothesis and
reference. The augmented versions of METEOR proposed (using word embeddings, lexical resources or
both) allow us to objectively compare the contribution of each approach to measure sentence similarity.
For this, correlations between METEOR and human judgements (of MT outputs) are measured within
the framework of WMT 2014 Metrics task. The code of the augmented versions of METEOR is also
provided on our Github page3.

Outline: in section 2 (Related Work), we quickly present METEOR, lexical resources and word em-
beddings. Section 3 presents our propositions to augment METEOR in order to conduct a fair comparison
between lexical resources and vector representations respectively. Section 4 presents our experiments
made within the framework of WMT 2014, as well as quantitative and qualitative analyses. Finally,
section 5 concludes this work and gives some perpectives.

2 Related Work

2.1.1 The origins

2.1 An automatic metric for MT evaluation: METEOR

METEOR was proposed to compensate BLEU’s and NIST’s weaknesses (Papineni et al., 2002;
Doddington, 2002). In short, METEOR was created to better correlate with human judgements by using
more than word-to-word alignments between a hypothesis and some references. The alignment is made
according to three modules: the ﬁrst stage uses exact match between word surface forms (Exact mod-
ule), the second one compares word stems (Stems module) and the third one uses synonyms (Synonym
module) from a lexical resource such as WordNet (available for English only in METEOR).

One contribution of this paper is to propose an alternative to Stems and Synonym modules: our pro-

posed add-on will be called Vectors module later on.

2.1.2 Recent extensions of METEOR

METEOR-NEXT (Denkowski and Lavie, 2010a) was proposed to better correlate with HTER (Human-
targeted Translation Edit Rate – HTER (Snover et al., 2006)). HTER is a semi-automatic post-editing
based metric, which measures the edit distance between a hypothesis and a reference. METEOR-NEXT
proposes to go further than just word-to-word alignment by using phrase-to-phrase alignments. For this,
phrase databases were created for several languages like English (Snover et al., 2009), German, French
or Czech (Denkowski and Lavie, 2010b). More recently, another version called METEOR Universal
used bitexts to extract paraphrases (Denkowski and Lavie, 2014).

METEOR was also extended by using Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD)

techniques
(Apidianaki and Marie, 2015). The authors used Babelﬂy (Moro et al., 2014) for several langage pairs
(translation from French, Hindi, German, Czech and Russian to English). A better correlation with
human judgement at segment level was observed using WSD in METEOR.

Finally,

to extend the use of Synonym module to target

languages others than English,
Elloumi et al. (2015) proposed to replace WordNet by DBnary (Sérasset, 2012). The new target lan-
guages equipped with a Synonym module were French, German, Spanish, Russian and English.

2.2 Lexical resources

2.2.1 WordNet

WordNet is a well known lexical resource for English. Created at the University of Princeton
(Fellbaum, 1998), it is used in several NLP tasks such as Machine Translation, Word Sense Disam-

3https://github.com/cservan/METEOR-E

biguation, Cross-lingual Information Retrieval, etc. WordNet links nouns, verbs, adjectives and adverbs
to a set of synonyms called “synsets”. Each synset represents a speciﬁc concept.

Synsets are linked to each other according to semantic, conceptual and lexical relations. Words with
multiple meanings correspond to multiple synsets and meanings are sorted according to their frequency.
WordNet is available in several languages (Arabic, French, etc.) but these versions are not freely avail-
able. In METEOR, only English WordNet is used to match hypothesis and reference words according to
their meanings. It contains more than 117,000 synsets.

To extract lemmatized forms, METEOR uses a function called Morphy-7WN1 which ﬁrstly checks
special cases in an exception list and secondly uses rules to lemmatize words according to their syntactic
class.

2.2.2 DBnary

DBnary is a multilingual lexical resource in RDF format (Klyne and Carroll, 2004). This resource
has been collected by Sérasset (2012). Lexical data are represented using the LEMON vocabulary
(McCrae et al., 2011). Most Part-of-Speech tags are linked with Olia standards or Lexinfo vocabular-
ies (Chiarcos and Sukhareva, 2015; Cimiano et al., 2011) which makes them reusable in many contexts.
DBnary is downloadable or available online through a SPARQL access point. Lexical data are auto-

matically extracted from Wiktionary, Wikipedia’s dictionary for 21 languages4.

Table 1: Detail of the data used from DBnary for the languages targeted in this paper.

Among available lexical data, one may ﬁnd 2.9M lexical entries (with parts-of-speech, canonical form
for all of them, along with pronunciations when available and inﬂected forms for some languages).
Lexical entries are subdivided into 2.5M lexical senses (with their deﬁnitions and some usage example).
DBnary also contains more than 4.6M translations going from the 21 extracted sources languages
to more than 1500 different target languages. Additionally, DBnary contains lexicosemantic relations
(syno/anto-nyms, hypo/hypero-nyms, etc.). Table 1 shows the size of the data for languages involved in
the experiments later reported in this paper. Additional ﬁgures are available on the DBnary public web
site5.

Lemmatized forms for DBnary are based on the TreeTagger module (Schmid, 1995), which enables

us to ﬁnd the corresponding synsets.

2.3 Monolingual and bilingual embeddings

2.3.1 Overview

Learning word embeddings is an active research area (Bengio et al., 2003; Turian et al., 2010;
Collobert et al., 2011; Huang et al., 2012). The main idea is to learn a word representation according
to its context: the surrounding words (Baroni and Zamparelli, 2010). The words are projected on a con-
tinuous space and those with similar context should be close in this multi-dimensional space. When
word vectors are available, a similarity between two words can be measured by a metric such as a cosine
similarity.

Using word-embeddings for machine translation evaluation is appealing since they can be used to
compute similarity between words or phrases in the same language (monolingual embeddings capture
intrinsically synonymy or morphological closeness) or in two different languages (bilingual embeddings
allow to directly compute a distance between two sentences in different languages). We use the Mul-
tiVec (Bérard et al., 2016) toolkit for computing and managing the continuous representations of texts.

It includes word2vec (Mikolov et al., 2013a), paragraph vector (Le and Mikolov, 2014b) and bilingual
distributed representations (Luong et al., 2015) features.

2.3.2 Use of vector representations in NLP evaluation

Zou et al. (2013) proposed to use bilingual word embeddings to detect similarities for word alignment.
This information is used as an additional parameter in a phrase-based machine translation system.
(Banchs et al., 2015) proposed to explore a metric funded on latent semantic analysis (Salton et al., 1975)
to extract semantic embeddings and measure the similarity between two sentences. Finally, these
word embeddings were used to enrich ROUGE, a metric for evaluating automatic summarization
(Ng and Abrecht, 2015).

As far as MT evaluation is concerned, Gupta et al. (2015) proposed a metric based on neural net-
work language models jointly with dependency trees to link an hypothesis to a reference. Meanwhile,
Vela and Tan (2015) proposed an approach to model document embeddings to predict translation ade-
quacy.

These works are close to ours but they propose metrics which need to be learned and optimized to
a speciﬁc task or domain. In our work, we use word embeddings trained once and for all on a (large)
general corpus. Our detailed methodology to augment METEOR metric is presented in the next section.

framework

(metrics

We augment METEOR in two ways: ﬁrstly, we replace the use of lexical resources by the use of
word embeddings. In other words, we replace Stem and Synonym modules by our new Vector module.
Secondly, we combine lexical resources and word embeddings by using jointly Stem, Synonym and our
Vector module.

To summarize, the following variants of METEOR are evaluated:

• METEOR Baseline: the METEOR score is estimated using Exact, Stem, Synonym and Paraphrase
modules for English as a target language and Exact, Stem and Paraphrase modules for other target
languages,

• METEOR DBnary: similar to METEOR Baseline but Synonym module is available for any target

language since it uses DBnary resource instead of Wordnet,

• METEOR Vector: the Stem and Synonym modules are replaced by the Vector module ;

• METEOR Baseline + Vector: the METEOR Baseline conﬁguration is augmented with the Vector

• METEOR DBnary + Vector:

the METEOR DBnary conﬁguration is augmented with the Vector

module.

3.2 METEOR DBnary

As mentioned in section 2.1, the Synonym module of METEOR uses WordNet’s synsets (117K entries
for English). As an alternative, we use another lexical resource: DBnary (Sérasset, 2012), as proposed
recently by Elloumi et al. (2015). This allows us to use Synonym module for any target language: French,
German, Spanish, Russian and English.

More precisely, synonym relations are extracted from DBnary using SPARQL request on the DBnary
server6. We extract data for English, French, Russian and German languages. The extraction process
outputs relations in the following format: lemma → Synonym. Then, these data are projected to the
WordNet format used in METEOR code. This process gives an identiﬁer (ID) for each lemma and builds
a list of synonym IDs for each lemma such as: lemma → ID_Syn1, ID_Syn2, ID_Syn3.

The ﬁrst two lines of Table 3 compare METEOR DBnary and METEOR Baseline for several French-

English MT systems submitted to WMT14 (Bojar et al., 2014).

METEOR DBnary improved the score by 0.7 points from METEOR Baseline. In other words, DBnary
seems to match more synonyms than WordNet, despite the fact that WordNet is 3.3 time bigger than
DBnary in English. This could be due to the fact that WordNet has only 4 morpho-syntactic categories
(Noun, Verbs, Adjectives and Adverbs) while DBnary has more morpho-syntactic categories.

3.3 METEOR Vector

As mentioned in section 2.3.2, we propose to replace lexical resources by word embeddings. Word
embeddings capture the context of the words. Consequently, similar word vectors may correspond to
synonyms or morphological variants (see section 2.3).

Table 2: Bilingual corpora used to train the word embeddings for each language pair.

In our Vector module, the matching between two words is done using a similarity score derived from
the cosine similarity.
If the similarity score is higher than a threshold, the words are considered as
matched (potential synonyms or morphological proximity). In our experiments, we evaluate using: (a)
a default threshold ﬁxed to 0.80 (b) an oracle threshold obtained empirically on the WMT14 data set
(Machacek and Bojar, 2014).

Table 2 summarizes data used to train monolingual word embeddings and bilingual word embeddings.
These word embeddings were trained with a CBOW model, a vector size of 50 and a windows size ±5
words, thanks to the MultiVec toolkit (Bérard et al., 2016).

Table 3: METEOR scores (all conﬁgurations) on the newstest corpus of the WMT14 translation evalua-
tion task from French to English.

The results presented in table 3 show that word embeddings (Vector module) can efﬁciently replace
lexical resources (Synonym and Stem modules) to match words in the translation hypothesis with those
in the reference. In addition, their combination shows a good potential to match even more words be-
tween hypothesis and reference. In the next section, we evaluate if the proposed versions of augmented
METEOR better correlate with human judgements.

4 Correlations of Augmented METEOR with Human Judgements

4.1 Results of different METEOR conﬁgurations

In these experiments, we present results obtained with the Vector module based on two threshold values:
a default one (0.80) and an oracle one which maximizes the correlation with human judgement.

6http://kaiko.getalp.org/about-dbnary/online-access/

Table 4 presents the correlation scores obtained within the framework of WMT14 metrics task
(Machacek and Bojar, 2014)7. The evaluation is done according to several translation tasks: from En-
glish to French (en–fr), German (en–de) and Russian (en–ru), and vice versa. French, German and
Russian as target languages represent a growing difﬁculty due to their morphology. English as target
language allows to compare the lexical databases (Wordnet vs DBnary).

To English. Firstly, when the translation direction is to English, we can observe that METEOR Base-
line and METEOR Vector get equivalent results in average. METEOR DBnary also obtains similar results
to METEOR Baseline. When we combine WordNet lexical resource and word embeddings (METEOR
Baseline + Vector), the reference score is increased by 0, 005 points. If the combination is done with
DBnary’s lexical data (METEOR DBnary + Vector), the improvement is similar.

For Vector module, optimization of the threshold slightly improves the average correlation. Combina-
tion of METEOR Baseline + Vector or METEOR DBnary + Vector improves by 0, 002 points when the
threshold is optimized.

From English. Secondly, when the translation direction is from English, we can observe an improve-
ment of the correlation score obtained with METEOR DBnary, compared with METEOR Baseline. This
is due to the fact that for French, German and Russian as target languages, METEOR Baseline does not
use any Synonym module. Our METEOR Vector with the default threshold also gets better correlation
scores compared to METEOR DBnary (+0.003 points in average). The combinations METEOR Baseline
+ Vector and METEOR DBnary + Vector further improve correlations with human judgements (+0.001
points in average). Finally, when we use an oracle threshold for Vector module, improvements are bigger
and can reach 0.013 points in average, compared to METEOR Baseline.

Investigating more embeddings conﬁgurations

In the previous section, METEOR Vector used a simple and monolingual word embedding conﬁguration.
This section investigates more conﬁgurations (monolingual and bilingual) to improve METEOR.

In this experiment, we focus only on METEOR Vector. Indeed, the monolingual (baseline) shown in
table 6 corresponds to the line METEOR Vector in Table 4. Firstly, we propose to train our embeddings
on bitexts (Table 2) using bivec approach (Luong et al., 2015). We also try to train pseudo-bilingual
embeddings on a pseudo bitext with target language text and POS tags (see an example in Table 5).
The main idea is to strongly link words with their syntactic class when learning word embeddings. We
call this kind of model pseudo-bilingual with POS. In the same way, we train bilingual models called

Table 6: Average correlation score at segment level for METEOR Vector with several training conﬁgura-
tions of word embeddings with the default threshold (0.80).

In the Table 6, we compare several training conﬁguration of the word embeddings through the same
protocol as previous section (only average correlations are reported while the detailed results will be
provided as supplementary material on the paper web page). When we observe the average results, the
bilingual embeddings seem not to be as efﬁcient as the monolingual baseline. The pseudo-bilingual ap-
proaches with POS and Lemmas obtained slightly the same results as the monolingual baseline regarding
all the conﬁgurations we have. Finally, the monolingual model learned on lemmas (instead of words)
tends to be slightly better when the translation direction is to English. However, this trend should be
conﬁrmed in a future investigation.

4.3 Discussion

The correlation scores obtained with the enriched metric tend to suggest that distributed representations
are as powerful as lexico-semantic resources for automatic MT evaluation. Furthermore, vector repre-
sentations can bring additional information, and they are deﬁnitely useful when no lexical resource is
available in the target language.

Considering the average correlation scores obtained, the conﬁgurations METEOR Vector and ME-
TEOR DBnary are comparable, except on German language, for which METEOR Vector obtained a bet-
ter correlation score. On the other hand, when we combine lexical data with Vector module (METEOR
DBnary + Vector), we observe a small increase of the correlation score, in particular when threshold is
tuned, which suggests a tunable version of METEOR.

Finally, several embeddings variants were trained but it seems that monolingual models are efﬁcient

enough for the speciﬁc task (MT evaluation) considered here.

4.3.1 Examples
To illustrate the word matching obtained by our versions of METEOR, we analyze two examples from
the evaluation data set. In these examples, we present the alignments obtained with METEOR DBnary +
Vector.

hypothesis:

pense qu’ il est concevable que ces données soient employées

pour

le bénéﬁce mutuel .

Reference:

estime qu’ il est concevable que ces données soient utilisées

dans leur intérêt mutuel .

je

j’

Table 7: First example from the system rbmt 1 evaluated with the combination METEOR DBnary +
Vector. The relations detected with the lexical resource DBnary are framed in continuous line while
those obtained thanks to the distributed representations are framed in dotted line.

The example presented in table 7 shows rbmt 1 system output submitted during the WMT14 trans-
lation task. METEOR baseline found only alignments for words with the same surface forms (“qu’ ”,
“il”, “est”, etc. – these forms are found identical thanks to the Exact module and are not highlighted
here). The Synonym module based on DBnary makes it possible to ﬁnd a correspondence between words

“employées” – “utilisées” and “pour” – “dans”. Lastly, Vector module indicates that words “pense”
and “estime” are contextually closed, just as the words “je” and “j”’. When the example is only evalu-
ated with METEOR Vector, words “employées” and “utilisées” are also paired with the default threshold
(0.80). On the other hand, the words “bénéﬁce” and “intérêt” are paired by the module Vector only if
the decision threshold is lowered to 0.75.

hypothesis:

le créateur de SAS disait il

faisait un genre du feuilleton géopolitique .

Reference:

le père de SAS disait

faire un genre de feuilleton géopolitique .

Table 8: Another example scored with the combination METEOR DBnary + Vector.

In the second example presented in table 8, the hypothesis is provided by rbmt 4 system. As in the
previous example, the correspondences found with Synonym module based on DBnary (framed by one
continuous line) are supplemented by those found by Vector module (dotted line): Synonym module
found “créateur” – “père” and “faisait” – “faire”; while “du” and “de” are aligned thanks to Vector
module.

These examples illustrate the complementarity between lexical resources and word embeddings for
sentence similarity detection. Word vectors can enable to match important words (like “pense” and
“estime” in our ﬁrst example), but also empty words (like “du” et “de” in our second example).

4.3.2 Limitations of Word Embeddings
So far, we did not deal with Out-Of-Vocabulary (OOV) words in METEOR Vector. By OOV we mean
words that do not have a vector representation because they were not found in the training corpus for
word embeddings. In that case, no matching can occur between the word in the hypothesis and words in
reference. Consequently, it might be interesting to carefully select the training corpus for word vectors
so that it will be close enough to the machine translation outputs to evaluate. This could be considered
in future works.

5 Conclusion and Perspectives

In this paper, we proposed to compare text similarity measures based on vector representations with
similarity measures based on lexico-semantic resources. Our work was applied to machine translation
evaluation and we extended an existing evaluation metric called METEOR. Our experiments have shown
that word vector representations can be useful when no lexical resource is available in the target language.
Moreover, it seems that these representations can bring complementary information in addition to lexical
resources (experiments done for French, English, German and Russian as target languages).

Our future works on this topic will focus on the use of phrase embeddings to complement the Para-
phrase module of METEOR. We also plan to introduce a syntax ﬂavor in our Vector module by weighting
the cosine distances differently according to the morpho-syntactic category of the words. Finally, we will
study the adaptation of our approach to other metrics such as TER-Plus, for instance.

The tool, the data and the models presented in this paper will be put online8 to facilitate reproducibility

of the experiments we carried out.

Abstract

This paper presents an approach combining lexico-semantic resources and distributed rep-
resentations of words applied to the evaluation in machine translation (MT). This study is
made through the enrichment of a well-known MT evaluation metric: METEOR. This metric
enables an approximate match (synonymy or morphological similarity) between an automatic
and a reference translation. Our experiments are made in the framework of the Metrics task of
WMT 2014. We show that distributed representations are a good alternative to lexico-semantic
resources for MT evaluation and they can even bring interesting additional information. The
augmented versions of METEOR, using vector representations, are made available on our
Github page.

1 Introduction

Learning vector representations of words using neural networks has generated a strong enthusiasm
in the NLP research community.
In particular, many contributions were proposed after the work of
(Mikolov et al., 2013a; Mikolov et al., 2013b; Mikolov et al., 2013c) on training word embeddings. The
main reasons for this strong interest are: the proposal of a simple and efﬁcient neural architecture to
learn word vector representations, the availability of an open source tool Word2Vec1 and the rapid struc-
turing of a user community2. Later on, several contributions have extended the work of Mikolov on word
vectors to phrases (sequences of words) (Mikolov et al., 2013b; Le and Mikolov, 2014a) and to bilingual
representations (Luong et al., 2015). All these vector representations capture similarities between words,
phrases or sentences at different levels (morphological, semantic).

However, although these representations can be semantically informative, they do not exactly replace
ﬁne-grained information available in lexical-semantic resources such as WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998), Ba-
belNet (Navigli and Ponzetto, 2010), or DBnary (Sérasset, 2012). Such lexical resources are also more
easily interpretable by humans as shown in (Panchenko, 2016), but their construction is costly while
word embeddings can be trained ad inﬁnitum on any monolingual or bilingual corpora.

In short, both approaches (lexical resources and word embeddings) have their pros and cons. However,
few studies have attempted to compare and combine them. Pioneering work of Faruqui et al. (2014)
proposed to reﬁne representations learning using lexical resources. The idea is to force words connected
in the lexical network, to have a close representation (for example through a synonymy link). The
technique proposed is evaluated on several benchmarks (word similarity, sentiment analysis, ﬁnding of
synonyms). More recently, Panchenko (2016) and Rothe and Schütze (2015) extended word embeddings
to sense embeddings and tried to compare them to lexical synsets.

Contributions: this article attempts to review the contribution of vector representations to measure
sentence similarity. We compare them with similarity measures based on lexical resources such as Word-
Net or DBnary. Machine Translation (MT) evaluation was identiﬁed as a particularly interesting applica-
tion to investigate, since MT evaluation is still an open problem nowadays. More precisely, we propose
to augment a well known MT evaluation metric (METEOR (Banerjee and Lavie, 2005)) which allows
an approximate matching (through synonymy or morphological similarity) between MT hypothesis and
reference. The augmented versions of METEOR proposed (using word embeddings, lexical resources or
both) allow us to objectively compare the contribution of each approach to measure sentence similarity.
For this, correlations between METEOR and human judgements (of MT outputs) are measured within
the framework of WMT 2014 Metrics task. The code of the augmented versions of METEOR is also
provided on our Github page3.

Outline: in section 2 (Related Work), we quickly present METEOR, lexical resources and word em-
beddings. Section 3 presents our propositions to augment METEOR in order to conduct a fair comparison
between lexical resources and vector representations respectively. Section 4 presents our experiments
made within the framework of WMT 2014, as well as quantitative and qualitative analyses. Finally,
section 5 concludes this work and gives some perpectives.

2 Related Work

2.1.1 The origins

2.1 An automatic metric for MT evaluation: METEOR

METEOR was proposed to compensate BLEU’s and NIST’s weaknesses (Papineni et al., 2002;
Doddington, 2002). In short, METEOR was created to better correlate with human judgements by using
more than word-to-word alignments between a hypothesis and some references. The alignment is made
according to three modules: the ﬁrst stage uses exact match between word surface forms (Exact mod-
ule), the second one compares word stems (Stems module) and the third one uses synonyms (Synonym
module) from a lexical resource such as WordNet (available for English only in METEOR).

One contribution of this paper is to propose an alternative to Stems and Synonym modules: our pro-

posed add-on will be called Vectors module later on.

2.1.2 Recent extensions of METEOR

METEOR-NEXT (Denkowski and Lavie, 2010a) was proposed to better correlate with HTER (Human-
targeted Translation Edit Rate – HTER (Snover et al., 2006)). HTER is a semi-automatic post-editing
based metric, which measures the edit distance between a hypothesis and a reference. METEOR-NEXT
proposes to go further than just word-to-word alignment by using phrase-to-phrase alignments. For this,
phrase databases were created for several languages like English (Snover et al., 2009), German, French
or Czech (Denkowski and Lavie, 2010b). More recently, another version called METEOR Universal
used bitexts to extract paraphrases (Denkowski and Lavie, 2014).

METEOR was also extended by using Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD)

techniques
(Apidianaki and Marie, 2015). The authors used Babelﬂy (Moro et al., 2014) for several langage pairs
(translation from French, Hindi, German, Czech and Russian to English). A better correlation with
human judgement at segment level was observed using WSD in METEOR.

Finally,

to extend the use of Synonym module to target

languages others than English,
Elloumi et al. (2015) proposed to replace WordNet by DBnary (Sérasset, 2012). The new target lan-
guages equipped with a Synonym module were French, German, Spanish, Russian and English.

2.2 Lexical resources

2.2.1 WordNet

WordNet is a well known lexical resource for English. Created at the University of Princeton
(Fellbaum, 1998), it is used in several NLP tasks such as Machine Translation, Word Sense Disam-

3https://github.com/cservan/METEOR-E

biguation, Cross-lingual Information Retrieval, etc. WordNet links nouns, verbs, adjectives and adverbs
to a set of synonyms called “synsets”. Each synset represents a speciﬁc concept.

Synsets are linked to each other according to semantic, conceptual and lexical relations. Words with
multiple meanings correspond to multiple synsets and meanings are sorted according to their frequency.
WordNet is available in several languages (Arabic, French, etc.) but these versions are not freely avail-
able. In METEOR, only English WordNet is used to match hypothesis and reference words according to
their meanings. It contains more than 117,000 synsets.

To extract lemmatized forms, METEOR uses a function called Morphy-7WN1 which ﬁrstly checks
special cases in an exception list and secondly uses rules to lemmatize words according to their syntactic
class.

2.2.2 DBnary

DBnary is a multilingual lexical resource in RDF format (Klyne and Carroll, 2004). This resource
has been collected by Sérasset (2012). Lexical data are represented using the LEMON vocabulary
(McCrae et al., 2011). Most Part-of-Speech tags are linked with Olia standards or Lexinfo vocabular-
ies (Chiarcos and Sukhareva, 2015; Cimiano et al., 2011) which makes them reusable in many contexts.
DBnary is downloadable or available online through a SPARQL access point. Lexical data are auto-

matically extracted from Wiktionary, Wikipedia’s dictionary for 21 languages4.

Table 1: Detail of the data used from DBnary for the languages targeted in this paper.

Among available lexical data, one may ﬁnd 2.9M lexical entries (with parts-of-speech, canonical form
for all of them, along with pronunciations when available and inﬂected forms for some languages).
Lexical entries are subdivided into 2.5M lexical senses (with their deﬁnitions and some usage example).
DBnary also contains more than 4.6M translations going from the 21 extracted sources languages
to more than 1500 different target languages. Additionally, DBnary contains lexicosemantic relations
(syno/anto-nyms, hypo/hypero-nyms, etc.). Table 1 shows the size of the data for languages involved in
the experiments later reported in this paper. Additional ﬁgures are available on the DBnary public web
site5.

Lemmatized forms for DBnary are based on the TreeTagger module (Schmid, 1995), which enables

us to ﬁnd the corresponding synsets.

2.3 Monolingual and bilingual embeddings

2.3.1 Overview

Learning word embeddings is an active research area (Bengio et al., 2003; Turian et al., 2010;
Collobert et al., 2011; Huang et al., 2012). The main idea is to learn a word representation according
to its context: the surrounding words (Baroni and Zamparelli, 2010). The words are projected on a con-
tinuous space and those with similar context should be close in this multi-dimensional space. When
word vectors are available, a similarity between two words can be measured by a metric such as a cosine
similarity.

Using word-embeddings for machine translation evaluation is appealing since they can be used to
compute similarity between words or phrases in the same language (monolingual embeddings capture
intrinsically synonymy or morphological closeness) or in two different languages (bilingual embeddings
allow to directly compute a distance between two sentences in different languages). We use the Mul-
tiVec (Bérard et al., 2016) toolkit for computing and managing the continuous representations of texts.

It includes word2vec (Mikolov et al., 2013a), paragraph vector (Le and Mikolov, 2014b) and bilingual
distributed representations (Luong et al., 2015) features.

2.3.2 Use of vector representations in NLP evaluation

Zou et al. (2013) proposed to use bilingual word embeddings to detect similarities for word alignment.
This information is used as an additional parameter in a phrase-based machine translation system.
(Banchs et al., 2015) proposed to explore a metric funded on latent semantic analysis (Salton et al., 1975)
to extract semantic embeddings and measure the similarity between two sentences. Finally, these
word embeddings were used to enrich ROUGE, a metric for evaluating automatic summarization
(Ng and Abrecht, 2015).

As far as MT evaluation is concerned, Gupta et al. (2015) proposed a metric based on neural net-
work language models jointly with dependency trees to link an hypothesis to a reference. Meanwhile,
Vela and Tan (2015) proposed an approach to model document embeddings to predict translation ade-
quacy.

These works are close to ours but they propose metrics which need to be learned and optimized to
a speciﬁc task or domain. In our work, we use word embeddings trained once and for all on a (large)
general corpus. Our detailed methodology to augment METEOR metric is presented in the next section.

(Machacek and Bojar, 2014)). This framework enables us to estimate the correlation of proposed
evaluation metric with human judgements for several machine translation outputs and several language

segment level Kendall’s τ correlation coefﬁcient, as proposed in WMT14 (based on systems ranking at
sentence level by humans, compared to automatic metric ranking).

framework

(metrics

We augment METEOR in two ways: ﬁrstly, we replace the use of lexical resources by the use of
word embeddings. In other words, we replace Stem and Synonym modules by our new Vector module.
Secondly, we combine lexical resources and word embeddings by using jointly Stem, Synonym and our
Vector module.

To summarize, the following variants of METEOR are evaluated:

• METEOR Baseline: the METEOR score is estimated using Exact, Stem, Synonym and Paraphrase
modules for English as a target language and Exact, Stem and Paraphrase modules for other target
languages,

• METEOR DBnary: similar to METEOR Baseline but Synonym module is available for any target

language since it uses DBnary resource instead of Wordnet,

• METEOR Vector: the Stem and Synonym modules are replaced by the Vector module ;

• METEOR Baseline + Vector: the METEOR Baseline conﬁguration is augmented with the Vector

• METEOR DBnary + Vector:

the METEOR DBnary conﬁguration is augmented with the Vector

module.

3.2 METEOR DBnary

As mentioned in section 2.1, the Synonym module of METEOR uses WordNet’s synsets (117K entries
for English). As an alternative, we use another lexical resource: DBnary (Sérasset, 2012), as proposed
recently by Elloumi et al. (2015). This allows us to use Synonym module for any target language: French,
German, Spanish, Russian and English.

More precisely, synonym relations are extracted from DBnary using SPARQL request on the DBnary
server6. We extract data for English, French, Russian and German languages. The extraction process
outputs relations in the following format: lemma → Synonym. Then, these data are projected to the
WordNet format used in METEOR code. This process gives an identiﬁer (ID) for each lemma and builds
a list of synonym IDs for each lemma such as: lemma → ID_Syn1, ID_Syn2, ID_Syn3.

The ﬁrst two lines of Table 3 compare METEOR DBnary and METEOR Baseline for several French-

English MT systems submitted to WMT14 (Bojar et al., 2014).

METEOR DBnary improved the score by 0.7 points from METEOR Baseline. In other words, DBnary
seems to match more synonyms than WordNet, despite the fact that WordNet is 3.3 time bigger than
DBnary in English. This could be due to the fact that WordNet has only 4 morpho-syntactic categories
(Noun, Verbs, Adjectives and Adverbs) while DBnary has more morpho-syntactic categories.

3.3 METEOR Vector

As mentioned in section 2.3.2, we propose to replace lexical resources by word embeddings. Word
embeddings capture the context of the words. Consequently, similar word vectors may correspond to
synonyms or morphological variants (see section 2.3).

Table 2: Bilingual corpora used to train the word embeddings for each language pair.

In our Vector module, the matching between two words is done using a similarity score derived from
the cosine similarity.
If the similarity score is higher than a threshold, the words are considered as
matched (potential synonyms or morphological proximity). In our experiments, we evaluate using: (a)
a default threshold ﬁxed to 0.80 (b) an oracle threshold obtained empirically on the WMT14 data set
(Machacek and Bojar, 2014).

Table 2 summarizes data used to train monolingual word embeddings and bilingual word embeddings.
These word embeddings were trained with a CBOW model, a vector size of 50 and a windows size ±5
words, thanks to the MultiVec toolkit (Bérard et al., 2016).

Table 3: METEOR scores (all conﬁgurations) on the newstest corpus of the WMT14 translation evalua-
tion task from French to English.

The results presented in table 3 show that word embeddings (Vector module) can efﬁciently replace
lexical resources (Synonym and Stem modules) to match words in the translation hypothesis with those
in the reference. In addition, their combination shows a good potential to match even more words be-
tween hypothesis and reference. In the next section, we evaluate if the proposed versions of augmented
METEOR better correlate with human judgements.

4 Correlations of Augmented METEOR with Human Judgements

4.1 Results of different METEOR conﬁgurations

In these experiments, we present results obtained with the Vector module based on two threshold values:
a default one (0.80) and an oracle one which maximizes the correlation with human judgement.

6http://kaiko.getalp.org/about-dbnary/online-access/

Table 4 presents the correlation scores obtained within the framework of WMT14 metrics task
(Machacek and Bojar, 2014)7. The evaluation is done according to several translation tasks: from En-
glish to French (en–fr), German (en–de) and Russian (en–ru), and vice versa. French, German and
Russian as target languages represent a growing difﬁculty due to their morphology. English as target
language allows to compare the lexical databases (Wordnet vs DBnary).

To English. Firstly, when the translation direction is to English, we can observe that METEOR Base-
line and METEOR Vector get equivalent results in average. METEOR DBnary also obtains similar results
to METEOR Baseline. When we combine WordNet lexical resource and word embeddings (METEOR
Baseline + Vector), the reference score is increased by 0, 005 points. If the combination is done with
DBnary’s lexical data (METEOR DBnary + Vector), the improvement is similar.

For Vector module, optimization of the threshold slightly improves the average correlation. Combina-
tion of METEOR Baseline + Vector or METEOR DBnary + Vector improves by 0, 002 points when the
threshold is optimized.

From English. Secondly, when the translation direction is from English, we can observe an improve-
ment of the correlation score obtained with METEOR DBnary, compared with METEOR Baseline. This
is due to the fact that for French, German and Russian as target languages, METEOR Baseline does not
use any Synonym module. Our METEOR Vector with the default threshold also gets better correlation
scores compared to METEOR DBnary (+0.003 points in average). The combinations METEOR Baseline
+ Vector and METEOR DBnary + Vector further improve correlations with human judgements (+0.001
points in average). Finally, when we use an oracle threshold for Vector module, improvements are bigger
and can reach 0.013 points in average, compared to METEOR Baseline.

Investigating more embeddings conﬁgurations

In the previous section, METEOR Vector used a simple and monolingual word embedding conﬁguration.
This section investigates more conﬁgurations (monolingual and bilingual) to improve METEOR.

In this experiment, we focus only on METEOR Vector. Indeed, the monolingual (baseline) shown in
table 6 corresponds to the line METEOR Vector in Table 4. Firstly, we propose to train our embeddings
on bitexts (Table 2) using bivec approach (Luong et al., 2015). We also try to train pseudo-bilingual
embeddings on a pseudo bitext with target language text and POS tags (see an example in Table 5).
The main idea is to strongly link words with their syntactic class when learning word embeddings. We
call this kind of model pseudo-bilingual with POS. In the same way, we train bilingual models called

Table 6: Average correlation score at segment level for METEOR Vector with several training conﬁgura-
tions of word embeddings with the default threshold (0.80).

In the Table 6, we compare several training conﬁguration of the word embeddings through the same
protocol as previous section (only average correlations are reported while the detailed results will be
provided as supplementary material on the paper web page). When we observe the average results, the
bilingual embeddings seem not to be as efﬁcient as the monolingual baseline. The pseudo-bilingual ap-
proaches with POS and Lemmas obtained slightly the same results as the monolingual baseline regarding
all the conﬁgurations we have. Finally, the monolingual model learned on lemmas (instead of words)
tends to be slightly better when the translation direction is to English. However, this trend should be
conﬁrmed in a future investigation.

4.3 Discussion

The correlation scores obtained with the enriched metric tend to suggest that distributed representations
are as powerful as lexico-semantic resources for automatic MT evaluation. Furthermore, vector repre-
sentations can bring additional information, and they are deﬁnitely useful when no lexical resource is
available in the target language.

Considering the average correlation scores obtained, the conﬁgurations METEOR Vector and ME-
TEOR DBnary are comparable, except on German language, for which METEOR Vector obtained a bet-
ter correlation score. On the other hand, when we combine lexical data with Vector module (METEOR
DBnary + Vector), we observe a small increase of the correlation score, in particular when threshold is
tuned, which suggests a tunable version of METEOR.

Finally, several embeddings variants were trained but it seems that monolingual models are efﬁcient

enough for the speciﬁc task (MT evaluation) considered here.

4.3.1 Examples
To illustrate the word matching obtained by our versions of METEOR, we analyze two examples from
the evaluation data set. In these examples, we present the alignments obtained with METEOR DBnary +
Vector.

hypothesis:

pense qu’ il est concevable que ces données soient employées

pour

le bénéﬁce mutuel .

Reference:

Table 7: First example from the system rbmt 1 evaluated with the combination METEOR DBnary +
Vector. The relations detected with the lexical resource DBnary are framed in continuous line while
those obtained thanks to the distributed representations are framed in dotted line.

The example presented in table 7 shows rbmt 1 system output submitted during the WMT14 trans-
lation task. METEOR baseline found only alignments for words with the same surface forms (“qu’ ”,
“il”, “est”, etc. – these forms are found identical thanks to the Exact module and are not highlighted
here). The Synonym module based on DBnary makes it possible to ﬁnd a correspondence between words

“employées” – “utilisées” and “pour” – “dans”. Lastly, Vector module indicates that words “pense”
and “estime” are contextually closed, just as the words “je” and “j”’. When the example is only evalu-
ated with METEOR Vector, words “employées” and “utilisées” are also paired with the default threshold
(0.80). On the other hand, the words “bénéﬁce” and “intérêt” are paired by the module Vector only if
the decision threshold is lowered to 0.75.

hypothesis:

le créateur de SAS disait il

faisait un genre du feuilleton géopolitique .

Reference:

le père de SAS disait

faire un genre de feuilleton géopolitique .

Table 8: Another example scored with the combination METEOR DBnary + Vector.

In the second example presented in table 8, the hypothesis is provided by rbmt 4 system. As in the
previous example, the correspondences found with Synonym module based on DBnary (framed by one
continuous line) are supplemented by those found by Vector module (dotted line): Synonym module
found “créateur” – “père” and “faisait” – “faire”; while “du” and “de” are aligned thanks to Vector
module.

These examples illustrate the complementarity between lexical resources and word embeddings for
sentence similarity detection. Word vectors can enable to match important words (like “pense” and
“estime” in our ﬁrst example), but also empty words (like “du” et “de” in our second example).

4.3.2 Limitations of Word Embeddings
So far, we did not deal with Out-Of-Vocabulary (OOV) words in METEOR Vector. By OOV we mean
words that do not have a vector representation because they were not found in the training corpus for
word embeddings. In that case, no matching can occur between the word in the hypothesis and words in
reference. Consequently, it might be interesting to carefully select the training corpus for word vectors
so that it will be close enough to the machine translation outputs to evaluate. This could be considered
in future works.

5 Conclusion and Perspectives

In this paper, we proposed to compare text similarity measures based on vector representations with
similarity measures based on lexico-semantic resources. Our work was applied to machine translation
evaluation and we extended an existing evaluation metric called METEOR. Our experiments have shown
that word vector representations can be useful when no lexical resource is available in the target language.
Moreover, it seems that these representations can bring complementary information in addition to lexical
resources (experiments done for French, English, German and Russian as target languages).

Our future works on this topic will focus on the use of phrase embeddings to complement the Para-
phrase module of METEOR. We also plan to introduce a syntax ﬂavor in our Vector module by weighting
the cosine distances differently according to the morpho-syntactic category of the words. Finally, we will
study the adaptation of our approach to other metrics such as TER-Plus, for instance.

The tool, the data and the models presented in this paper will be put online8 to facilitate reproducibility

of the experiments we carried out.

Abstract

This paper presents an approach combining lexico-semantic resources and distributed rep-
resentations of words applied to the evaluation in machine translation (MT). This study is
made through the enrichment of a well-known MT evaluation metric: METEOR. This metric
enables an approximate match (synonymy or morphological similarity) between an automatic
and a reference translation. Our experiments are made in the framework of the Metrics task of
WMT 2014. We show that distributed representations are a good alternative to lexico-semantic
resources for MT evaluation and they can even bring interesting additional information. The
augmented versions of METEOR, using vector representations, are made available on our
Github page.

1 Introduction

Learning vector representations of words using neural networks has generated a strong enthusiasm
in the NLP research community.
In particular, many contributions were proposed after the work of
(Mikolov et al., 2013a; Mikolov et al., 2013b; Mikolov et al., 2013c) on training word embeddings. The
main reasons for this strong interest are: the proposal of a simple and efﬁcient neural architecture to
learn word vector representations, the availability of an open source tool Word2Vec1 and the rapid struc-
turing of a user community2. Later on, several contributions have extended the work of Mikolov on word
vectors to phrases (sequences of words) (Mikolov et al., 2013b; Le and Mikolov, 2014a) and to bilingual
representations (Luong et al., 2015). All these vector representations capture similarities between words,
phrases or sentences at different levels (morphological, semantic).

However, although these representations can be semantically informative, they do not exactly replace
ﬁne-grained information available in lexical-semantic resources such as WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998), Ba-
belNet (Navigli and Ponzetto, 2010), or DBnary (Sérasset, 2012). Such lexical resources are also more
easily interpretable by humans as shown in (Panchenko, 2016), but their construction is costly while
word embeddings can be trained ad inﬁnitum on any monolingual or bilingual corpora.

In short, both approaches (lexical resources and word embeddings) have their pros and cons. However,
few studies have attempted to compare and combine them. Pioneering work of Faruqui et al. (2014)
proposed to reﬁne representations learning using lexical resources. The idea is to force words connected
in the lexical network, to have a close representation (for example through a synonymy link). The
technique proposed is evaluated on several benchmarks (word similarity, sentiment analysis, ﬁnding of
synonyms). More recently, Panchenko (2016) and Rothe and Schütze (2015) extended word embeddings
to sense embeddings and tried to compare them to lexical synsets.

Contributions: this article attempts to review the contribution of vector representations to measure
sentence similarity. We compare them with similarity measures based on lexical resources such as Word-
Net or DBnary. Machine Translation (MT) evaluation was identiﬁed as a particularly interesting applica-
tion to investigate, since MT evaluation is still an open problem nowadays. More precisely, we propose
to augment a well known MT evaluation metric (METEOR (Banerjee and Lavie, 2005)) which allows
an approximate matching (through synonymy or morphological similarity) between MT hypothesis and
reference. The augmented versions of METEOR proposed (using word embeddings, lexical resources or
both) allow us to objectively compare the contribution of each approach to measure sentence similarity.
For this, correlations between METEOR and human judgements (of MT outputs) are measured within
the framework of WMT 2014 Metrics task. The code of the augmented versions of METEOR is also
provided on our Github page3.

Outline: in section 2 (Related Work), we quickly present METEOR, lexical resources and word em-
beddings. Section 3 presents our propositions to augment METEOR in order to conduct a fair comparison
between lexical resources and vector representations respectively. Section 4 presents our experiments
made within the framework of WMT 2014, as well as quantitative and qualitative analyses. Finally,
section 5 concludes this work and gives some perpectives.

2 Related Work

2.1.1 The origins

2.1 An automatic metric for MT evaluation: METEOR

METEOR was proposed to compensate BLEU’s and NIST’s weaknesses (Papineni et al., 2002;
Doddington, 2002). In short, METEOR was created to better correlate with human judgements by using
more than word-to-word alignments between a hypothesis and some references. The alignment is made
according to three modules: the ﬁrst stage uses exact match between word surface forms (Exact mod-
ule), the second one compares word stems (Stems module) and the third one uses synonyms (Synonym
module) from a lexical resource such as WordNet (available for English only in METEOR).

One contribution of this paper is to propose an alternative to Stems and Synonym modules: our pro-

posed add-on will be called Vectors module later on.

2.1.2 Recent extensions of METEOR

METEOR-NEXT (Denkowski and Lavie, 2010a) was proposed to better correlate with HTER (Human-
targeted Translation Edit Rate – HTER (Snover et al., 2006)). HTER is a semi-automatic post-editing
based metric, which measures the edit distance between a hypothesis and a reference. METEOR-NEXT
proposes to go further than just word-to-word alignment by using phrase-to-phrase alignments. For this,
phrase databases were created for several languages like English (Snover et al., 2009), German, French
or Czech (Denkowski and Lavie, 2010b). More recently, another version called METEOR Universal
used bitexts to extract paraphrases (Denkowski and Lavie, 2014).

METEOR was also extended by using Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD)

techniques
(Apidianaki and Marie, 2015). The authors used Babelﬂy (Moro et al., 2014) for several langage pairs
(translation from French, Hindi, German, Czech and Russian to English). A better correlation with
human judgement at segment level was observed using WSD in METEOR.

Finally,

to extend the use of Synonym module to target

languages others than English,
Elloumi et al. (2015) proposed to replace WordNet by DBnary (Sérasset, 2012). The new target lan-
guages equipped with a Synonym module were French, German, Spanish, Russian and English.

2.2 Lexical resources

2.2.1 WordNet

WordNet is a well known lexical resource for English. Created at the University of Princeton
(Fellbaum, 1998), it is used in several NLP tasks such as Machine Translation, Word Sense Disam-

3https://github.com/cservan/METEOR-E

biguation, Cross-lingual Information Retrieval, etc. WordNet links nouns, verbs, adjectives and adverbs
to a set of synonyms called “synsets”. Each synset represents a speciﬁc concept.

Synsets are linked to each other according to semantic, conceptual and lexical relations. Words with
multiple meanings correspond to multiple synsets and meanings are sorted according to their frequency.
WordNet is available in several languages (Arabic, French, etc.) but these versions are not freely avail-
able. In METEOR, only English WordNet is used to match hypothesis and reference words according to
their meanings. It contains more than 117,000 synsets.

To extract lemmatized forms, METEOR uses a function called Morphy-7WN1 which ﬁrstly checks
special cases in an exception list and secondly uses rules to lemmatize words according to their syntactic
class.

2.2.2 DBnary

DBnary is a multilingual lexical resource in RDF format (Klyne and Carroll, 2004). This resource
has been collected by Sérasset (2012). Lexical data are represented using the LEMON vocabulary
(McCrae et al., 2011). Most Part-of-Speech tags are linked with Olia standards or Lexinfo vocabular-
ies (Chiarcos and Sukhareva, 2015; Cimiano et al., 2011) which makes them reusable in many contexts.
DBnary is downloadable or available online through a SPARQL access point. Lexical data are auto-

matically extracted from Wiktionary, Wikipedia’s dictionary for 21 languages4.

Table 1: Detail of the data used from DBnary for the languages targeted in this paper.

Among available lexical data, one may ﬁnd 2.9M lexical entries (with parts-of-speech, canonical form
for all of them, along with pronunciations when available and inﬂected forms for some languages).
Lexical entries are subdivided into 2.5M lexical senses (with their deﬁnitions and some usage example).
DBnary also contains more than 4.6M translations going from the 21 extracted sources languages
to more than 1500 different target languages. Additionally, DBnary contains lexicosemantic relations
(syno/anto-nyms, hypo/hypero-nyms, etc.). Table 1 shows the size of the data for languages involved in
the experiments later reported in this paper. Additional ﬁgures are available on the DBnary public web
site5.

Lemmatized forms for DBnary are based on the TreeTagger module (Schmid, 1995), which enables

us to ﬁnd the corresponding synsets.

2.3 Monolingual and bilingual embeddings

2.3.1 Overview

Learning word embeddings is an active research area (Bengio et al., 2003; Turian et al., 2010;
Collobert et al., 2011; Huang et al., 2012). The main idea is to learn a word representation according
to its context: the surrounding words (Baroni and Zamparelli, 2010). The words are projected on a con-
tinuous space and those with similar context should be close in this multi-dimensional space. When
word vectors are available, a similarity between two words can be measured by a metric such as a cosine
similarity.

Using word-embeddings for machine translation evaluation is appealing since they can be used to
compute similarity between words or phrases in the same language (monolingual embeddings capture
intrinsically synonymy or morphological closeness) or in two different languages (bilingual embeddings
allow to directly compute a distance between two sentences in different languages). We use the Mul-
tiVec (Bérard et al., 2016) toolkit for computing and managing the continuous representations of texts.

It includes word2vec (Mikolov et al., 2013a), paragraph vector (Le and Mikolov, 2014b) and bilingual
distributed representations (Luong et al., 2015) features.

2.3.2 Use of vector representations in NLP evaluation

Zou et al. (2013) proposed to use bilingual word embeddings to detect similarities for word alignment.
This information is used as an additional parameter in a phrase-based machine translation system.
(Banchs et al., 2015) proposed to explore a metric funded on latent semantic analysis (Salton et al., 1975)
to extract semantic embeddings and measure the similarity between two sentences. Finally, these
word embeddings were used to enrich ROUGE, a metric for evaluating automatic summarization
(Ng and Abrecht, 2015).

As far as MT evaluation is concerned, Gupta et al. (2015) proposed a metric based on neural net-
work language models jointly with dependency trees to link an hypothesis to a reference. Meanwhile,
Vela and Tan (2015) proposed an approach to model document embeddings to predict translation ade-
quacy.

These works are close to ours but they propose metrics which need to be learned and optimized to
a speciﬁc task or domain. In our work, we use word embeddings trained once and for all on a (large)
general corpus. Our detailed methodology to augment METEOR metric is presented in the next section.

framework

(metrics

We augment METEOR in two ways: ﬁrstly, we replace the use of lexical resources by the use of
word embeddings. In other words, we replace Stem and Synonym modules by our new Vector module.
Secondly, we combine lexical resources and word embeddings by using jointly Stem, Synonym and our
Vector module.

To summarize, the following variants of METEOR are evaluated:

• METEOR Baseline: the METEOR score is estimated using Exact, Stem, Synonym and Paraphrase
modules for English as a target language and Exact, Stem and Paraphrase modules for other target
languages,

• METEOR DBnary: similar to METEOR Baseline but Synonym module is available for any target

language since it uses DBnary resource instead of Wordnet,

• METEOR Vector: the Stem and Synonym modules are replaced by the Vector module ;

• METEOR Baseline + Vector: the METEOR Baseline conﬁguration is augmented with the Vector

• METEOR DBnary + Vector:

the METEOR DBnary conﬁguration is augmented with the Vector

module.

3.2 METEOR DBnary

As mentioned in section 2.1, the Synonym module of METEOR uses WordNet’s synsets (117K entries
for English). As an alternative, we use another lexical resource: DBnary (Sérasset, 2012), as proposed
recently by Elloumi et al. (2015). This allows us to use Synonym module for any target language: French,
German, Spanish, Russian and English.

More precisely, synonym relations are extracted from DBnary using SPARQL request on the DBnary
server6. We extract data for English, French, Russian and German languages. The extraction process
outputs relations in the following format: lemma → Synonym. Then, these data are projected to the
WordNet format used in METEOR code. This process gives an identiﬁer (ID) for each lemma and builds
a list of synonym IDs for each lemma such as: lemma → ID_Syn1, ID_Syn2, ID_Syn3.

The ﬁrst two lines of Table 3 compare METEOR DBnary and METEOR Baseline for several French-

English MT systems submitted to WMT14 (Bojar et al., 2014).

METEOR DBnary improved the score by 0.7 points from METEOR Baseline. In other words, DBnary
seems to match more synonyms than WordNet, despite the fact that WordNet is 3.3 time bigger than
DBnary in English. This could be due to the fact that WordNet has only 4 morpho-syntactic categories
(Noun, Verbs, Adjectives and Adverbs) while DBnary has more morpho-syntactic categories.

3.3 METEOR Vector

As mentioned in section 2.3.2, we propose to replace lexical resources by word embeddings. Word
embeddings capture the context of the words. Consequently, similar word vectors may correspond to
synonyms or morphological variants (see section 2.3).

Table 2: Bilingual corpora used to train the word embeddings for each language pair.

In our Vector module, the matching between two words is done using a similarity score derived from
the cosine similarity.
If the similarity score is higher than a threshold, the words are considered as
matched (potential synonyms or morphological proximity). In our experiments, we evaluate using: (a)
a default threshold ﬁxed to 0.80 (b) an oracle threshold obtained empirically on the WMT14 data set
(Machacek and Bojar, 2014).

Table 2 summarizes data used to train monolingual word embeddings and bilingual word embeddings.
These word embeddings were trained with a CBOW model, a vector size of 50 and a windows size ±5
words, thanks to the MultiVec toolkit (Bérard et al., 2016).

Table 3: METEOR scores (all conﬁgurations) on the newstest corpus of the WMT14 translation evalua-
tion task from French to English.

The results presented in table 3 show that word embeddings (Vector module) can efﬁciently replace
lexical resources (Synonym and Stem modules) to match words in the translation hypothesis with those
in the reference. In addition, their combination shows a good potential to match even more words be-
tween hypothesis and reference. In the next section, we evaluate if the proposed versions of augmented
METEOR better correlate with human judgements.

4 Correlations of Augmented METEOR with Human Judgements

4.1 Results of different METEOR conﬁgurations

In these experiments, we present results obtained with the Vector module based on two threshold values:
a default one (0.80) and an oracle one which maximizes the correlation with human judgement.

6http://kaiko.getalp.org/about-dbnary/online-access/

Table 4 presents the correlation scores obtained within the framework of WMT14 metrics task
(Machacek and Bojar, 2014)7. The evaluation is done according to several translation tasks: from En-
glish to French (en–fr), German (en–de) and Russian (en–ru), and vice versa. French, German and
Russian as target languages represent a growing difﬁculty due to their morphology. English as target
language allows to compare the lexical databases (Wordnet vs DBnary).

To English. Firstly, when the translation direction is to English, we can observe that METEOR Base-
line and METEOR Vector get equivalent results in average. METEOR DBnary also obtains similar results
to METEOR Baseline. When we combine WordNet lexical resource and word embeddings (METEOR
Baseline + Vector), the reference score is increased by 0, 005 points. If the combination is done with
DBnary’s lexical data (METEOR DBnary + Vector), the improvement is similar.

For Vector module, optimization of the threshold slightly improves the average correlation. Combina-
tion of METEOR Baseline + Vector or METEOR DBnary + Vector improves by 0, 002 points when the
threshold is optimized.

From English. Secondly, when the translation direction is from English, we can observe an improve-
ment of the correlation score obtained with METEOR DBnary, compared with METEOR Baseline. This
is due to the fact that for French, German and Russian as target languages, METEOR Baseline does not
use any Synonym module. Our METEOR Vector with the default threshold also gets better correlation
scores compared to METEOR DBnary (+0.003 points in average). The combinations METEOR Baseline
+ Vector and METEOR DBnary + Vector further improve correlations with human judgements (+0.001
points in average). Finally, when we use an oracle threshold for Vector module, improvements are bigger
and can reach 0.013 points in average, compared to METEOR Baseline.

default threshold (0.80) and secondly with the oracle threshold (under the dashed line).

Investigating more embeddings conﬁgurations

In the previous section, METEOR Vector used a simple and monolingual word embedding conﬁguration.
This section investigates more conﬁgurations (monolingual and bilingual) to improve METEOR.

In this experiment, we focus only on METEOR Vector. Indeed, the monolingual (baseline) shown in
table 6 corresponds to the line METEOR Vector in Table 4. Firstly, we propose to train our embeddings
on bitexts (Table 2) using bivec approach (Luong et al., 2015). We also try to train pseudo-bilingual
embeddings on a pseudo bitext with target language text and POS tags (see an example in Table 5).
The main idea is to strongly link words with their syntactic class when learning word embeddings. We
call this kind of model pseudo-bilingual with POS. In the same way, we train bilingual models called

Table 6: Average correlation score at segment level for METEOR Vector with several training conﬁgura-
tions of word embeddings with the default threshold (0.80).

In the Table 6, we compare several training conﬁguration of the word embeddings through the same
protocol as previous section (only average correlations are reported while the detailed results will be
provided as supplementary material on the paper web page). When we observe the average results, the
bilingual embeddings seem not to be as efﬁcient as the monolingual baseline. The pseudo-bilingual ap-
proaches with POS and Lemmas obtained slightly the same results as the monolingual baseline regarding
all the conﬁgurations we have. Finally, the monolingual model learned on lemmas (instead of words)
tends to be slightly better when the translation direction is to English. However, this trend should be
conﬁrmed in a future investigation.

4.3 Discussion

The correlation scores obtained with the enriched metric tend to suggest that distributed representations
are as powerful as lexico-semantic resources for automatic MT evaluation. Furthermore, vector repre-
sentations can bring additional information, and they are deﬁnitely useful when no lexical resource is
available in the target language.

Considering the average correlation scores obtained, the conﬁgurations METEOR Vector and ME-
TEOR DBnary are comparable, except on German language, for which METEOR Vector obtained a bet-
ter correlation score. On the other hand, when we combine lexical data with Vector module (METEOR
DBnary + Vector), we observe a small increase of the correlation score, in particular when threshold is
tuned, which suggests a tunable version of METEOR.

Finally, several embeddings variants were trained but it seems that monolingual models are efﬁcient

enough for the speciﬁc task (MT evaluation) considered here.

4.3.1 Examples
To illustrate the word matching obtained by our versions of METEOR, we analyze two examples from
the evaluation data set. In these examples, we present the alignments obtained with METEOR DBnary +
Vector.

hypothesis:

pense qu’ il est concevable que ces données soient employées

pour

le bénéﬁce mutuel .

Reference:

estime qu’ il est concevable que ces données soient utilisées

dans leur intérêt mutuel .

je

j’

Table 7: First example from the system rbmt 1 evaluated with the combination METEOR DBnary +
Vector. The relations detected with the lexical resource DBnary are framed in continuous line while
those obtained thanks to the distributed representations are framed in dotted line.

The example presented in table 7 shows rbmt 1 system output submitted during the WMT14 trans-
lation task. METEOR baseline found only alignments for words with the same surface forms (“qu’ ”,
“il”, “est”, etc. – these forms are found identical thanks to the Exact module and are not highlighted
here). The Synonym module based on DBnary makes it possible to ﬁnd a correspondence between words

“employées” – “utilisées” and “pour” – “dans”. Lastly, Vector module indicates that words “pense”
and “estime” are contextually closed, just as the words “je” and “j”’. When the example is only evalu-
ated with METEOR Vector, words “employées” and “utilisées” are also paired with the default threshold
(0.80). On the other hand, the words “bénéﬁce” and “intérêt” are paired by the module Vector only if
the decision threshold is lowered to 0.75.

hypothesis:

le créateur de SAS disait il

faisait un genre du feuilleton géopolitique .

Reference:

le père de SAS disait

faire un genre de feuilleton géopolitique .

Table 8: Another example scored with the combination METEOR DBnary + Vector.

In the second example presented in table 8, the hypothesis is provided by rbmt 4 system. As in the
previous example, the correspondences found with Synonym module based on DBnary (framed by one
continuous line) are supplemented by those found by Vector module (dotted line): Synonym module
found “créateur” – “père” and “faisait” – “faire”; while “du” and “de” are aligned thanks to Vector
module.

These examples illustrate the complementarity between lexical resources and word embeddings for
sentence similarity detection. Word vectors can enable to match important words (like “pense” and
“estime” in our ﬁrst example), but also empty words (like “du” et “de” in our second example).

4.3.2 Limitations of Word Embeddings
So far, we did not deal with Out-Of-Vocabulary (OOV) words in METEOR Vector. By OOV we mean
words that do not have a vector representation because they were not found in the training corpus for
word embeddings. In that case, no matching can occur between the word in the hypothesis and words in
reference. Consequently, it might be interesting to carefully select the training corpus for word vectors
so that it will be close enough to the machine translation outputs to evaluate. This could be considered
in future works.

5 Conclusion and Perspectives

In this paper, we proposed to compare text similarity measures based on vector representations with
similarity measures based on lexico-semantic resources. Our work was applied to machine translation
evaluation and we extended an existing evaluation metric called METEOR. Our experiments have shown
that word vector representations can be useful when no lexical resource is available in the target language.
Moreover, it seems that these representations can bring complementary information in addition to lexical
resources (experiments done for French, English, German and Russian as target languages).

Our future works on this topic will focus on the use of phrase embeddings to complement the Para-
phrase module of METEOR. We also plan to introduce a syntax ﬂavor in our Vector module by weighting
the cosine distances differently according to the morpho-syntactic category of the words. Finally, we will
study the adaptation of our approach to other metrics such as TER-Plus, for instance.

The tool, the data and the models presented in this paper will be put online8 to facilitate reproducibility

of the experiments we carried out.
