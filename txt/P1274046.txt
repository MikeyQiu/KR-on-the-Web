Abstract

Satirical news is considered to be enter-
tainment, but it is potentially deceptive
and harmful. Despite the embedded genre
in the article, not everyone can recognize
the satirical cues and therefore believe the
news as true news. We observe that satiri-
cal cues are often reﬂected in certain para-
graphs rather than the whole document.
Existing works only consider document-
level features to detect the satire, which
could be limited. We consider paragraph-
level linguistic features to unveil the satire
by incorporating neural network and atten-
tion mechanism. We investigate the differ-
ence between paragraph-level features and
document-level features, and analyze them
on a large satirical news dataset. The eval-
uation shows that the proposed model de-
tects satirical news effectively and reveals
what features are important at which level.

Introduction

“When information is cheap, attention
becomes expensive.” — James Gleick

Satirical news is considered to be entertainment.
However, it is not easy to recognize the satire if the
satirical cues are too subtle to be unmasked and the
reader lacks the contextual or cultural background.
The example illustrated in Table 1 is a piece of
satirical news with subtle satirical cues.

Assuming readers interpret satirical news as
true news, there is not much difference between
satirical news and fake news in terms of the con-
sequence, which may hurt the credibility of the
In fact, it is

reported in the Guardian that people may believe
satirical news and spread them to the public re-

...
“Kids these days are done with stories where things
happen,” said CBC consultant and world's oldest child
psychologist Obadiah Sugarman. “We'll ﬁnally be giv-
ing them the stiff Victorian morality that I assume is in
vogue. Not to mention, doing a period piece is a great
way to make sure white people are adequately repre-
sented on television.”

gardless of the ridiculous content1. It is also con-
cluded that fake news is similar to satirical news
via a thorough comparison among true news, fake
news, and satirical news (Horne and Adali, 2017).
This paper focuses on satirical news detection to
ensure the trustworthiness of online news and pre-
vent the spreading of potential misleading infor-
mation.

Some works tackling fake news and mislead-
ing information favor to discover the truth (Xiao
et al., 2016; Wan et al., 2016) through knowledge
base (Dong et al., 2015) and truthfulness estima-
tion (Ge et al., 2013). These approaches may
not be feasible for satirical news because there
is no ground-truth in the stories. Another track
of works analyze social network activities (Zhao
et al., 2015) to evaluate the spreading informa-
tion (Gupta et al., 2012; Castillo et al., 2011). This
could be ineffective for both fake news and satiri-
cal news because once they are distributed on the
social network, the damage has been done. Fi-
nally, works evaluating culture difference (P´erez-
Rosas and Mihalcea, 2014), psycholinguistic fea-
tures (Ott et al., 2011), and writing styles (Feng
et al., 2012) for deception detection are suitable
for satirical news detection. These works consider
features at document level, while we observe that
satirical cues are usually located in certain para-

fake-news-satire

graphs rather than the whole document. This in-
dicates that many document level features may be
superﬂuous and less effective.

To understand how paragraph-level features and
document-level features are varied towards detec-
tion decision when only document level labels are
available, we propose a 4-level neural network
in a character-word-paragraph-document hierar-
chy and utilize attention mechanism (Bahdanau
et al., 2014) to reveal their relative difference. We
apply psycholinguistic features, writing stylistic
features, structural features, and readability fea-
tures to understand satire. The paragraph-level
features are embedded into attention mechanism
for selecting highly attended paragraphs, and the
document-level features are incorporated for the
ﬁnal classiﬁcation. This is the ﬁrst work that un-
veils satirical cues between paragraph-level and
document-level through neural networks to our
knowledge.

We make the following contributions in our pa-

per:

• We propose a 4-level hierarchical network for
satirical news detection. The model detects
satirical news effectively and incorporates at-
tention mechanism to reveal paragraph-level
satirical cues.

• We show that paragraph-level features are
more important than document-level features
in terms of the psycholinguistic feature, writ-
ing stylistic feature, and structural feature,
while the readability feature is more impor-
tant at the document level.

• We collect satirical news (16,000+) and true
news (160,000+) from various sources and
conduct extensive experiments on this cor-
pus2.

2 Related Work

We categorize related works into four categories:
content-based detection for news genre, truth veri-
ﬁcation and truthfulness evaluation, deception de-
tection, and identiﬁcation of highly attended com-
ponent using attention mechanism.

social media. Burfoot and Baldwin (2009) intro-
duce headline features, profanity, and slang to
embody satirical news. They consider absurdity
as the major device in satirical news and model
this feature by comparing entity combination in a
given document with Google query results. Rubin
et al. (2016) also consider absurdity but model
it through unexpected new name entities. They
introduce additional features including humor,
grammar, negative affect, and punctuation to em-
power the detection. Besides satirical news, Chen
et al. (2015) aim to detect click-baits, whose
content exaggerates fact. Potthast et al. (2017)
report a writing style analysis of hyperpartisan
news. Barbieri et al. (2015) focus on multilingual
tweets that advertise satirical news.

It is noteworthy that satirical news used for
evaluation in above works are of limited quantity
(around 200 articles). Diverse examples of satire
may not be included as discussed by Rubin et al.
(2016). This issue inspires us to collect more than
16,000 satirical news for our experiment.

Truth discovery and truthfulness evalua-
tion. Although truth extraction from inconsistent
sources (Ge et al., 2013; Wan et al., 2016; Li et al.,
2016) and from conﬂicting sources (Yin et al.,
2008; Li et al., 2014b), truth inference through
knowledge base (Dong et al., 2015), and discov-
ering evolving truth (Li et al., 2015) could help
identify fact and detect fake news, they cannot fa-
vor much for satirical news as the story is entirely
made up and the ground-truth is hardly found.
Analyzing user activities (Farajtabar et al., 2017)
and interactions (Castillo et al., 2011; Mukher-
jee and Weikum, 2015) to evaluate the credibility
may not be appropriate for satirical news as it can-
not prevent the spreading. Therefore, we utilize
content-based features, including psycholinguistic
features, writing stylistic features, structural fea-
tures, and readability features, to address satirical
news detection.

Deception detection. We believe satirical
news and opinion spam share similar character-
istics of writing ﬁctitious and deceptive content,
which can be identiﬁed via a psycholinguistic con-
sideration (Mihalcea and Strapparava, 2009; Ott
et al., 2011). Beyond that, both syntactic sty-
lometry (Feng et al., 2012) and behavioral fea-
tures (Mukherjee et al., 2013b) are effective for de-
tecting deceptive reviews, while stylistic features
are practical to deal with obfuscating and imitat-

ing writings (Afroz et al., 2012). However, decep-
tive content varies among paragraphs in the same
document, and so does satire. We focus on de-
vising and evaluating paragraph-level features to
reveal the satire in this work. We compare them
with features at the document level, so we are able
to tell what features are important at which level.
Identiﬁcation of highly attended component
using attention mechanism. Attention mech-
anism is widely applied in machine transla-
tion (Bahdanau et al., 2014),
language infer-
ence (Rockt¨aschel et al., 2015), and question an-
In addition, Yang
swering (Chen et al., 2016a).
et al. (2016b) propose hierarchical attention net-
work to understand both attended words and sen-
tences for sentiment classiﬁcation. Chen et al.
(2016b) enhance the attention with the support of
user preference and product information to com-
prehend how user and product affect sentiment rat-
ings. Due to the capability of attention mecha-
nism, we employ the same strategy to show at-
tended component for satirical news. Different
from above works, we further evaluate linguis-
tic features of highly attended paragraphs to an-
alyze characteristics of satirical news, which has
not been explored to our knowledge.

3 The Proposed Model

We ﬁrst present our 4-level hierarchical neural
network and explain how linguistic features can
be embedded in the network to reveal the differ-
ence between paragraph level and document level.
Then we describe the linguistic features.

3.1 The 4-Level Hierarchical Model

We build the model in a hierarchy of character-
word-paragraph-document. The general overview
of the model can be viewed in Figure 1 and the
notations are listed in Table 2.

Table 2: Notations and meanings

Figure 1: The overview of the proposed model.
The document has 3 paragraphs and each para-
graph contains 4 words. We omit character-level
convolution neural network but leave xc to sym-
bolize the representation learned from it.

3.1.1 Character-Level Encoder

We use convolutional neural networks (CNN) to
encode word representation from characters. CNN
is effective in extracting morphological informa-
tion and name entities (Ma and Hovy, 2016), both
of which are common in news. Each word is pre-
sented as a sequence of n characters and each char-
acter is embedded into a low-dimension vector.
The sequence of characters c is brought to the net-
work. A convolution operation with a ﬁlter wc
is applied and moved along the sequence. Max
pooling is performed to select the most important
feature generated by the previous operation. The
word representation xc ∈ Rf is generated with f
ﬁlters.

3.1.2 Word-Level Encoder

i,t, as xi,t = [xc

Assume a sequence of words of paragraph i arrives
at time t. The current word representation xi,t
concatenates xc
i,t from character level with pre-
trained word embedding xe
i,t].
Examples are given in Figure 1. We implement
Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) (Cho et al., 2014)
rather than LSTM (Hochreiter and Schmidhuber,
1997) to encode the sequence because GRU has
fewer parameters. The GRU adopts reset gate
ri,t and update gate zi,t to control the informa-
tion ﬂow between the input xi,t and the candidate

i,t; xe

state ˜hi,t. The output hidden state hi,t is computed
by manipulating previous state hi,t−1 and the can-
didate state ˜hi,t regarding to zi,t as in Equation 4,
where (cid:12) denotes element-wise multiplication.

zi,t = σ(Wzxi,t + Uzhi,t−1 + bz)
ri,t = σ(Wrxi,t + Urhi,t−1 + br)
(2)
˜hi,t = tanh(Whxi,t + ri,t (cid:12) (Uhhi,t−1 + bh))
(3)

(1)

hi,t = (1 − zi,t) (cid:12) hi,t−1 + zi,t (cid:12) ˜hi,t

(4)

To learn a better representation from the past
and the future, we use bidirectional-GRU (Bi-
GRU) to read the sequence of words with for-
←−−

GRU from xi,1 to xi,t, and backward

from xi,t to xi,1. The ﬁnal output of Bi-GRU

as [

3.1.3 Paragraph-Level Attention

We observe that not all paragraphs have satire and
some of them are functional to make the article
complete, so we incorporate attention mechanism
to reveal which paragraphs contribute to decision
making. Assuming a sequence of paragraph repre-
sentations have been constructed from lower lev-
els, another Bi-GRU is used to encode these rep-
resentations to a series of new states p1:t, so the
sequential orders are considered.

To decide how paragraphs should be attended,
we calculate satirical degree αi of paragraph i. We
ﬁrst convey pi into hidden states ui as in Equa-
tion 5. Then we product ui with a learnable satire-
aware vector va and feed the result into softmax
function as in Equation 6. The ﬁnal document rep-
resentation d is computed as a weighted sum of αi
and pi.

ui = tanh(Wapi + ba)

αi =

exp(u(cid:62)
i va)
j=0 exp(u(cid:62)

j va))

(cid:80)t

d =

αipi

Linguistic features are leveraged to support at-
tending satire paragraph. Besides pi, we represent
paragraph i based on our linguistic feature set and
transform it into a high-level feature vector lp
i via

multilayer perceptron (MLP). So ui in Equation 5
is updated to:

(8)

ui = tanh(Wapi + Ualp

i + ba)
3.1.4 Document-Level Classiﬁcation
Similar to the paragraph level, we represent doc-
ument j based on our linguistic feature set and
transform it into a high-level feature vector ld
j via
MLP. We concatenate dj and ld
j together for clas-
siﬁcation. Suppose yj ∈ (0, 1) is the label of the
document j, the prediction ˜yj and the loss func-
tion L over N documents are:

˜yj = sigmoid(Wddj + Udld

j + bd)

L = −

yj log ˜yj + (1 − yj) log(1 − ˜yj)

3.2 Linguistic Features

Linguistic features have been successfully applied
to expose differences between deceptive and gen-
uine content, so we subsume most of the features
in previous works. The idea of explaining ﬁcti-
tious content is extended here to reveal how satir-
ical news differs from true news. We divide our
linguistic features into four families and compute
them separately for paragraph and document.

Psycholinguistic Features: Psychological dif-
ferences are useful for our problem, because pro-
fessional journalists tend to express opinion con-
servatively to avoid unnecessary arguments. On
the contrary, satirical news includes aggressive
language for the entertainment purpose. We ad-
ditionally observe true news favors clarity and ac-
curacy while satirical news is related to emotional
cognition. To capture the above observations,
we employ Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count
(LIWC) (Pennebaker et al., 2007) as our psy-
cholinguistic dictionary. Each category of LIWC
is one independent feature and valued by its fre-
quency3.

Writing Stylistic Features: The relative distri-
bution of part-of-speech (POS) tags reﬂects infor-
mative vs. imaginative writing, which contributes
to detecting deceptions (Li et al., 2014a; Mukher-
jee et al., 2013a). We argue that the stories cov-
ered by satirical news are based on imagination.
In addition, POS tags are hints of the underlying

humor (Reyes et al., 2012), which is common in
satirical news. So we utilize POS tags (Toutanova
et al., 2003) to apprehend satire. Each tag is re-
garded as one independent feature and valued by
its frequency.

Readability Features: We consider readabil-
ity of genuine news would differ from satirical
news because the former is written by professional
journalists and tend to be clearer and more accu-
rate, while satirical news packs numerous clauses
to enrich the made-up story as introduced by Ru-
bin et al. (2016). Different from their work, we
use readability metrics, including Flesch Read-
ing Ease (Kincaid et al., 1975), Gunning Fog In-
dex (Gunning, 1952), Automated Readability In-
dex (Senter and Smith, 1967), ColemanLiau In-
dex (Coleman and Liau, 1975), and syllable count
per word, as features.

Structural Features: To further reﬂect the
structure of news articles, we examine the follow-
ing features: word count, log word count, number
of punctuations, number of digits, number of cap-
ital letters, and number of sentences.

4 Experiment and Evaluation

We report satirical news detection results and
show high weighted word features. Then, we pro-
vide a thorough analysis between paragraph-level
and document-level features. Finally, we visualize
an example of satirical news article to demonstrate
the effectiveness of our work.

4.1 Dataset

The satirical news is collected from 14 websites
that explicitly declare they are offering satire, so
the correct label can be guaranteed. We also no-
tice websites that mix true news, fake news, and
satirical news. We exclude these websites in this
work because it requires experts to annotate the
news articles.

We maintain each satire source in only one of
the train/validation/test sets4 as the cross-domain
4Train: Onion, the Spoof. Test: SatireWorld, Beaver-
ton, Ossurworld. Validation: DailyCurrent, DailyReport,

setting in (Li et al., 2014a). Otherwise, the prob-
lem may become writing pattern recognition or
news site classiﬁcation. We also combined dif-
ferent sources together5 as a similar setting of
leveraging multiple domains (Yang et al., 2016a).
The true news is collected from major news out-
lets6 and Google News using FLORIN (Liu et al.,
2015). The satirical news in the corpus is signif-
icantly less than true news, reﬂecting an impres-
sionistic view of the reality. We omit headline,
creation time, and author information so this work
concentrates on the satire in the article body. We
realize the corpus may contain different degree of
satire. Without the annotation, we only consider
binary classiﬁcation in this work and leave the de-
gree estimation for the future. The split and the
description of the dataset can be found in Table 3.

Implementation Detail

4.2
For SVM, we use the sklearn implementation7.
We ﬁnd that using linear kernel and setting
“class weight” to “balanced” mostly boost the re-
sult. We search soft-margin penalty “C” and ﬁnd
high results occur in range [10−1, 10−4]. We use
the validation set to tune the model so select-
ing hyper-parameters is consistent with neural net-
work based model.

For neural network based models, we use the
Theano package (Bastien et al., 2012) for imple-
mentation. The lengths of words, paragraphs,
and documents are ﬁxed at 24, 128, and 16 with
necessary padding or truncating. Stochastic Gra-
dient Descent is used with initial learning rate
of 0.3 and decay rate of 0.9. The training is
early stopped if the F1 drops 5 times continu-
ously. Word embeddings are initialized with 100-
dimension Glove embeddings (Pennington et al.,
2014). Character embeddings are randomly ini-
tialized with 30 dimensions. Speciﬁcally for the
proposed model, the following hyper-parameters
are estimated based on the validation set and used

amples and balanced validation/test sets.

in the ﬁnal test set. The dropout is applied with
probability of 0.5. The size of the hidden states is
set at 60. We use 30 ﬁlters with window size of 3
for convolution.

4.3 Performance of Satirical News Detection

We report accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 on
the validation set and the test set. All metrics
take satirical news as the positive class. Both
paragraph-level and document-level linguistic fea-
tures are scaled to have zero mean and unit vari-
ance, respectively. The compared methods in-
clude:

SVM word n-grams: Unigram and bigrams of
the words as the baseline. We report 1,2-grams
because it performs better than other n-grams.

SVM word n-grams + LF: 1,2-word grams
plus linguistic features. We omit comparison with
similar work (Ott et al., 2011) as their features are
subsumed in ours.

SVM word + char n-grams: 1,2-word grams

plus bigrams and trigrams of the characters.

SVM word + char n-grams + LF: All the pro-

posed features are considered.

SVM Rubin et al. (2016): Unigram and bi-
grams tf-idf with satirical features as proposed
in (Rubin et al., 2016). We compare with (Ru-
bin et al., 2016) rather than (Burfoot and Baldwin,
2009) as the former claims a better result.

SVM Rubin et al. (2016) + char tf-idf + LF:

Include all possible features.

Bi-GRU: Bi-GRU for document classiﬁcation.
The document representation is the average of the
hidden state at every time-step.

SVM Doc2Vec: Unsupervised method learning
distributed representation for documents (Le and
Mikolov, 2014). The implementation is based on

Gensim ( ˇReh˚uˇrek and Sojka, 2010).

HAN: Hierarchical Attention Network (Yang
et al., 2016b) for document classiﬁcation with both
word-level and sentence-level attention.

4LHN: 4-Level Hierarchical Network without

any linguistic features.

4LHNP: 4-Level Hierarchical Network with

Paragraph-level linguistic features.

4LHND: 4-Level Hierarchical Network with

Document-level linguistic features.

4LHNPD: 4-Level Hierarchical Network with
both Paragraph-level and Document-level linguis-
tic features.

In Table 4, the performances on the test set
are generally better than on the validation set due
to the cross-domain setting. We also explored
word-level attention (Yang et al., 2016b), but it
performed 2% worse than 4LHN. The result of
Doc2Vec is limited. We suspect the reason could
be the high imbalanced dataset, as an unsuper-
vised learning method for document representa-
tion heavily relies on the distribution of the doc-
ument.

to Table 5, we conclude satirical news mimics
true news by using news related words, such as
“stated” and “reporter”. However, these words
may be over used so they can be detected. True
news may use other evidence to support the cred-
ibility, which explains “twitter”, “com”, “video”,
and “pictured”. High weight of “ : ” indicates
that true news uses colon to list items for clarity.
High weight of “ '' ” indicates that satirical news
involves more conversation, which is consistent
with our observation. The ﬁnal interesting note is
satirical news favors “washington dc”. We suspect
that satirical news mostly covers politic topics, or
satire writers do not spend efforts on changing lo-
cations.

4.5 Analysis of Weighted Linguistic Features

We use 4LHNPD to compare paragraph-level and
document-level features, as 4LHNPD leverages
the two-level features into the same framework
and yields the best result.

Because all linguistic features are leveraged into
MLP with non-linear functions, it is hard to check
which feature indicates satire. Alternatively, we
deﬁne the importance of linguistic features by
summing the absolute value of the weights if di-
rectly connected to the feature. For example,
the importance I of feature k is given by Ik =
m=0 |wk,m|, where w ∈ RK×M is the di-
1
M
rectly connected weight, K is the number of fea-
tures, and M is the dimension of the output. This
metric gives a general idea about how much does
a feature contribute to the decision making.

(cid:80)M

We ﬁrst report the scaled importance of the four
linguistic feature sets by averaging the importance
of individual linguistic features. Then we report
individual important features within each set.

Figure 2: Comparing the importance of the four
feature sets at paragraph level and document level.

4.5.1 Comparing the Four Feature Sets

the importance of
According to Figure 2,
paragraph-level features is greater than document-
level features except for the readability feature
set. It is reasonable to use readability at the doc-
ument level because readability features evaluate
the understandability of a given text, which de-
pends on the content and the presentation. The
structural feature set is highly weighted for select-
ing attended paragraph, which inspires us to focus
on individual features inside the structural feature
set.

4.5.2 Comparing Individual Features

Within each set, we rank features based on the im-
portance score and report their mean and standard
deviation before being scaled in Table 6. At para-
graph level, we use top three attended paragraphs
for calculating. The respective p-values of all fea-
tures in the table are less than 0.01 based on the
t-test, indicating satirical news is statistically sig-
niﬁcantly different from true news.

Comparing Table 6 and Table 3, we ﬁnd that
the word count, capital letters, and punctuations
in true news are larger than in satirical news at
the document level, while at paragraph level these

Figure 3: An example of attended paragraphs.

features in true news are less than in satirical
news. This indicates satire paragraph could be
more complex locally.
It also could be referred
as “sentence complexity”, that “satirical articles
tend to pack a great number of clauses into a
sentence for comedic effect” (Rubin et al., 2016).
Accordingly, we hypothesize top complex para-
graphs could represent the entire satire document
for classiﬁcation, which we leave for future exam-
ination.

In Table 6, psycholinguistic feature “Humans”
is more related to emotional writing than con-
trol writing (Pennebaker et al., 2007), which in-
dicates satirical news is emotional and unprofes-
sional compared to true news. The same reason
also applies to “Social” and “Leisure”, where the
former implies emotional and the latter implies
control writing. The “Past” and “VBN” both have
higher frequencies in true news, which can be ex-
plained by the fact that true news covers what hap-
pened. A similar reason that true news reports
what happened to others explains a low “Self” and
a high “VBZ” in true news.

For writing stylistic features, it is suggested that
informative writing has more nouns, adjectives,
prepositions and coordinating conjunctions, while
imaginative writing has more verbs, adverbs, pro-
nouns, and pre-determiners (Rayson et al., 2001).
This explains higher frequencies of “RB” and
“PRP” in satirical news, and higher frequency of
“NN” and “CC” in true news. One exception is
“JJ”, adjectives, which receives the highest weight
in this feature set and indicates a higher frequency

in satirical news. We suspect adjective could also
be related to emotional writing, but more experi-
ments are required.

Readability suggests satirical news is easier to
be understood. Considering satirical news is also
deceptive (as the story is not true), this is consis-
tent with works (Frank et al., 2008; Afroz et al.,
2012) showing deceptive writings are more easily
comprehended than genuine writings. Finally, true
news has more digits and a higher “CD”(Cardinal
number) frequency, even at the paragraph level,
because they tend to be clear and accurate.

4.6 Visualization of Attended Paragraph

To explore the attention, we sample one example
in the validation set and present it in Figure 3. The
value at the right represents the scaled attention
score. The high attended paragraphs are longer
and have more capital letters as they are referring
different entities. They have more double quotes,
as multiple conversations are involved.

Moreover, we subjectively feel the attended
paragraph with score 0.98 has a sense of humor
while the paragraph with score 0.86 has a sense of
sarcasm, which are common in satire. The para-
graph with score 1.0 presents controversial topics,
which could be misleading if the reader cannot un-
derstand the satire. This is what we expect from
the attention mechanism. Based on the visualiza-
tion, we also feel this work could be generalized
to detect ﬁgurative languages.

5 Conclusion

In this paper, we proposed a 4-level hierarchical
network and utilized attention mechanism to un-
derstand satire at both paragraph level and doc-
ument level. The evaluation suggests readability
features support the ﬁnal classiﬁcation while psy-
cholinguistic features, writing stylistic features,
and structural features are beneﬁcial at the para-
graph level. In addition, although satirical news is
shorter than true news at the document level, we
ﬁnd satirical news generally contain paragraphs
which are more complex than true news at the
paragraph level. The analysis of individual fea-
tures reveals that the writing of satirical news tends
to be emotional and imaginative.

We will investigate efforts to model satire at the
paragraph level following our conclusion and the-
oretical backgrounds, such as (Ermida, 2012). We
plan to go beyond the binary classiﬁcation and ex-
plore satire degree estimation. We will generalize
our approach to reveal characteristics of ﬁgurative
language (Joshi et al., 2016), where different para-
graphs or sentences may reﬂect different degrees
of sarcasm, irony, and humor.

Abstract

Satirical news is considered to be enter-
tainment, but it is potentially deceptive
and harmful. Despite the embedded genre
in the article, not everyone can recognize
the satirical cues and therefore believe the
news as true news. We observe that satiri-
cal cues are often reﬂected in certain para-
graphs rather than the whole document.
Existing works only consider document-
level features to detect the satire, which
could be limited. We consider paragraph-
level linguistic features to unveil the satire
by incorporating neural network and atten-
tion mechanism. We investigate the differ-
ence between paragraph-level features and
document-level features, and analyze them
on a large satirical news dataset. The eval-
uation shows that the proposed model de-
tects satirical news effectively and reveals
what features are important at which level.

Introduction

“When information is cheap, attention
becomes expensive.” — James Gleick

Satirical news is considered to be entertainment.
However, it is not easy to recognize the satire if the
satirical cues are too subtle to be unmasked and the
reader lacks the contextual or cultural background.
The example illustrated in Table 1 is a piece of
satirical news with subtle satirical cues.

Assuming readers interpret satirical news as
true news, there is not much difference between
satirical news and fake news in terms of the con-
sequence, which may hurt the credibility of the
In fact, it is
media and the trust in the society.
reported in the Guardian that people may believe
satirical news and spread them to the public re-

...
“Kids these days are done with stories where things
happen,” said CBC consultant and world's oldest child
psychologist Obadiah Sugarman. “We'll ﬁnally be giv-
ing them the stiff Victorian morality that I assume is in
vogue. Not to mention, doing a period piece is a great
way to make sure white people are adequately repre-
sented on television.”

gardless of the ridiculous content1. It is also con-
cluded that fake news is similar to satirical news
via a thorough comparison among true news, fake
news, and satirical news (Horne and Adali, 2017).
This paper focuses on satirical news detection to
ensure the trustworthiness of online news and pre-
vent the spreading of potential misleading infor-
mation.

Some works tackling fake news and mislead-
ing information favor to discover the truth (Xiao
et al., 2016; Wan et al., 2016) through knowledge
base (Dong et al., 2015) and truthfulness estima-
tion (Ge et al., 2013). These approaches may
not be feasible for satirical news because there
is no ground-truth in the stories. Another track
of works analyze social network activities (Zhao
et al., 2015) to evaluate the spreading informa-
tion (Gupta et al., 2012; Castillo et al., 2011). This
could be ineffective for both fake news and satiri-
cal news because once they are distributed on the
social network, the damage has been done. Fi-
nally, works evaluating culture difference (P´erez-
Rosas and Mihalcea, 2014), psycholinguistic fea-
tures (Ott et al., 2011), and writing styles (Feng
et al., 2012) for deception detection are suitable
for satirical news detection. These works consider
features at document level, while we observe that
satirical cues are usually located in certain para-

1https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/nov/17/facebook-

fake-news-satire

graphs rather than the whole document. This in-
dicates that many document level features may be
superﬂuous and less effective.

To understand how paragraph-level features and
document-level features are varied towards detec-
tion decision when only document level labels are
available, we propose a 4-level neural network
in a character-word-paragraph-document hierar-
chy and utilize attention mechanism (Bahdanau
et al., 2014) to reveal their relative difference. We
apply psycholinguistic features, writing stylistic
features, structural features, and readability fea-
tures to understand satire. The paragraph-level
features are embedded into attention mechanism
for selecting highly attended paragraphs, and the
document-level features are incorporated for the
ﬁnal classiﬁcation. This is the ﬁrst work that un-
veils satirical cues between paragraph-level and
document-level through neural networks to our
knowledge.

We make the following contributions in our pa-

per:

• We propose a 4-level hierarchical network for
satirical news detection. The model detects
satirical news effectively and incorporates at-
tention mechanism to reveal paragraph-level
satirical cues.

• We show that paragraph-level features are
more important than document-level features
in terms of the psycholinguistic feature, writ-
ing stylistic feature, and structural feature,
while the readability feature is more impor-
tant at the document level.

• We collect satirical news (16,000+) and true
news (160,000+) from various sources and
conduct extensive experiments on this cor-
pus2.

2 Related Work

We categorize related works into four categories:
content-based detection for news genre, truth veri-
ﬁcation and truthfulness evaluation, deception de-

social media. Burfoot and Baldwin (2009) intro-
duce headline features, profanity, and slang to
embody satirical news. They consider absurdity
as the major device in satirical news and model
this feature by comparing entity combination in a
given document with Google query results. Rubin
et al. (2016) also consider absurdity but model
it through unexpected new name entities. They
introduce additional features including humor,
grammar, negative affect, and punctuation to em-
power the detection. Besides satirical news, Chen
et al. (2015) aim to detect click-baits, whose
content exaggerates fact. Potthast et al. (2017)
report a writing style analysis of hyperpartisan
news. Barbieri et al. (2015) focus on multilingual
tweets that advertise satirical news.

It is noteworthy that satirical news used for
evaluation in above works are of limited quantity
(around 200 articles). Diverse examples of satire
may not be included as discussed by Rubin et al.
(2016). This issue inspires us to collect more than
16,000 satirical news for our experiment.

sources (Ge et al., 2013; Wan et al., 2016; Li et al.,
2016) and from conﬂicting sources (Yin et al.,
2008; Li et al., 2014b), truth inference through
knowledge base (Dong et al., 2015), and discov-
ering evolving truth (Li et al., 2015) could help
identify fact and detect fake news, they cannot fa-
vor much for satirical news as the story is entirely
made up and the ground-truth is hardly found.
Analyzing user activities (Farajtabar et al., 2017)
and interactions (Castillo et al., 2011; Mukher-
jee and Weikum, 2015) to evaluate the credibility
may not be appropriate for satirical news as it can-
not prevent the spreading. Therefore, we utilize
content-based features, including psycholinguistic
features, writing stylistic features, structural fea-
tures, and readability features, to address satirical
news detection.

Deception detection. We believe satirical
news and opinion spam share similar character-
istics of writing ﬁctitious and deceptive content,
which can be identiﬁed via a psycholinguistic con-
sideration (Mihalcea and Strapparava, 2009; Ott
et al., 2011). Beyond that, both syntactic sty-
lometry (Feng et al., 2012) and behavioral fea-
tures (Mukherjee et al., 2013b) are effective for de-
tecting deceptive reviews, while stylistic features
are practical to deal with obfuscating and imitat-

ing writings (Afroz et al., 2012). However, decep-
tive content varies among paragraphs in the same
document, and so does satire. We focus on de-
vising and evaluating paragraph-level features to
reveal the satire in this work. We compare them
with features at the document level, so we are able
to tell what features are important at which level.
Identiﬁcation of highly attended component
using attention mechanism. Attention mech-
anism is widely applied in machine transla-
tion (Bahdanau et al., 2014),
language infer-
ence (Rockt¨aschel et al., 2015), and question an-
In addition, Yang
swering (Chen et al., 2016a).
et al. (2016b) propose hierarchical attention net-
work to understand both attended words and sen-
tences for sentiment classiﬁcation. Chen et al.
(2016b) enhance the attention with the support of
user preference and product information to com-
prehend how user and product affect sentiment rat-
ings. Due to the capability of attention mecha-
nism, we employ the same strategy to show at-
tended component for satirical news. Different
from above works, we further evaluate linguis-
tic features of highly attended paragraphs to an-
alyze characteristics of satirical news, which has
not been explored to our knowledge.

3 The Proposed Model

We ﬁrst present our 4-level hierarchical neural
network and explain how linguistic features can
be embedded in the network to reveal the differ-
ence between paragraph level and document level.
Then we describe the linguistic features.

3.1 The 4-Level Hierarchical Model

We build the model in a hierarchy of character-
word-paragraph-document. The general overview
of the model can be viewed in Figure 1 and the
notations are listed in Table 2.

Figure 1: The overview of the proposed model.
The document has 3 paragraphs and each para-
graph contains 4 words. We omit character-level
convolution neural network but leave xc to sym-
bolize the representation learned from it.

3.1.1 Character-Level Encoder

We use convolutional neural networks (CNN) to
encode word representation from characters. CNN
is effective in extracting morphological informa-
tion and name entities (Ma and Hovy, 2016), both
of which are common in news. Each word is pre-
sented as a sequence of n characters and each char-
acter is embedded into a low-dimension vector.
The sequence of characters c is brought to the net-
work. A convolution operation with a ﬁlter wc
is applied and moved along the sequence. Max
pooling is performed to select the most important
feature generated by the previous operation. The
word representation xc ∈ Rf is generated with f
ﬁlters.

3.1.2 Word-Level Encoder

i,t, as xi,t = [xc

Assume a sequence of words of paragraph i arrives
at time t. The current word representation xi,t
concatenates xc
i,t from character level with pre-
trained word embedding xe
i,t].
Examples are given in Figure 1. We implement
Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) (Cho et al., 2014)
rather than LSTM (Hochreiter and Schmidhuber,
1997) to encode the sequence because GRU has
fewer parameters. The GRU adopts reset gate
ri,t and update gate zi,t to control the informa-
tion ﬂow between the input xi,t and the candidate

i,t; xe

state ˜hi,t. The output hidden state hi,t is computed
by manipulating previous state hi,t−1 and the can-
didate state ˜hi,t regarding to zi,t as in Equation 4,
where (cid:12) denotes element-wise multiplication.

zi,t = σ(Wzxi,t + Uzhi,t−1 + bz)
ri,t = σ(Wrxi,t + Urhi,t−1 + br)
(2)
˜hi,t = tanh(Whxi,t + ri,t (cid:12) (Uhhi,t−1 + bh))
(3)

(1)

hi,t = (1 − zi,t) (cid:12) hi,t−1 + zi,t (cid:12) ˜hi,t

To learn a better representation from the past
and the future, we use bidirectional-GRU (Bi-
GRU) to read the sequence of words with for-
←−−

GRU from xi,1 to xi,t, and backward

3.1.3 Paragraph-Level Attention

We observe that not all paragraphs have satire and
some of them are functional to make the article
complete, so we incorporate attention mechanism
to reveal which paragraphs contribute to decision
making. Assuming a sequence of paragraph repre-
sentations have been constructed from lower lev-
els, another Bi-GRU is used to encode these rep-
resentations to a series of new states p1:t, so the
sequential orders are considered.

To decide how paragraphs should be attended,
we calculate satirical degree αi of paragraph i. We
ﬁrst convey pi into hidden states ui as in Equa-
tion 5. Then we product ui with a learnable satire-
aware vector va and feed the result into softmax
function as in Equation 6. The ﬁnal document rep-
resentation d is computed as a weighted sum of αi
and pi.

ui = tanh(Wapi + ba)

αi =

exp(u(cid:62)
i va)
j=0 exp(u(cid:62)

j va))

(cid:80)t

d =

αipi

Linguistic features are leveraged to support at-
tending satire paragraph. Besides pi, we represent
paragraph i based on our linguistic feature set and
transform it into a high-level feature vector lp
i via

multilayer perceptron (MLP). So ui in Equation 5
is updated to:

(8)

ui = tanh(Wapi + Ualp

i + ba)
3.1.4 Document-Level Classiﬁcation
Similar to the paragraph level, we represent doc-
ument j based on our linguistic feature set and
transform it into a high-level feature vector ld
j via
MLP. We concatenate dj and ld
j together for clas-
siﬁcation. Suppose yj ∈ (0, 1) is the label of the
document j, the prediction ˜yj and the loss func-
tion L over N documents are:

˜yj = sigmoid(Wddj + Udld

j + bd)

L = −

yj log ˜yj + (1 − yj) log(1 − ˜yj)

3.2 Linguistic Features

Linguistic features have been successfully applied
to expose differences between deceptive and gen-
uine content, so we subsume most of the features
in previous works. The idea of explaining ﬁcti-
tious content is extended here to reveal how satir-
ical news differs from true news. We divide our
linguistic features into four families and compute
them separately for paragraph and document.

Psycholinguistic Features: Psychological dif-
ferences are useful for our problem, because pro-
fessional journalists tend to express opinion con-
servatively to avoid unnecessary arguments. On
the contrary, satirical news includes aggressive
language for the entertainment purpose. We ad-
ditionally observe true news favors clarity and ac-
curacy while satirical news is related to emotional
cognition. To capture the above observations,
we employ Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count
(LIWC) (Pennebaker et al., 2007) as our psy-
cholinguistic dictionary. Each category of LIWC
is one independent feature and valued by its fre-
quency3.

Writing Stylistic Features: The relative distri-
bution of part-of-speech (POS) tags reﬂects infor-
mative vs. imaginative writing, which contributes
to detecting deceptions (Li et al., 2014a; Mukher-
jee et al., 2013a). We argue that the stories cov-
ered by satirical news are based on imagination.
In addition, POS tags are hints of the underlying

humor (Reyes et al., 2012), which is common in
satirical news. So we utilize POS tags (Toutanova
et al., 2003) to apprehend satire. Each tag is re-
garded as one independent feature and valued by
its frequency.

Readability Features: We consider readabil-
ity of genuine news would differ from satirical
news because the former is written by professional
journalists and tend to be clearer and more accu-
rate, while satirical news packs numerous clauses
to enrich the made-up story as introduced by Ru-
bin et al. (2016). Different from their work, we
use readability metrics, including Flesch Read-
ing Ease (Kincaid et al., 1975), Gunning Fog In-
dex (Gunning, 1952), Automated Readability In-
dex (Senter and Smith, 1967), ColemanLiau In-
dex (Coleman and Liau, 1975), and syllable count
per word, as features.

Structural Features: To further reﬂect the
structure of news articles, we examine the follow-
ing features: word count, log word count, number
of punctuations, number of digits, number of cap-
ital letters, and number of sentences.

4 Experiment and Evaluation

We report satirical news detection results and
show high weighted word features. Then, we pro-
vide a thorough analysis between paragraph-level
and document-level features. Finally, we visualize
an example of satirical news article to demonstrate
the effectiveness of our work.

4.1 Dataset

The satirical news is collected from 14 websites
that explicitly declare they are offering satire, so
the correct label can be guaranteed. We also no-
tice websites that mix true news, fake news, and
satirical news. We exclude these websites in this
work because it requires experts to annotate the
news articles.

We maintain each satire source in only one of
the train/validation/test sets4 as the cross-domain
4Train: Onion, the Spoof. Test: SatireWorld, Beaver-
ton, Ossurworld. Validation: DailyCurrent, DailyReport,

setting in (Li et al., 2014a). Otherwise, the prob-
lem may become writing pattern recognition or
news site classiﬁcation. We also combined dif-
ferent sources together5 as a similar setting of
leveraging multiple domains (Yang et al., 2016a).
The true news is collected from major news out-
lets6 and Google News using FLORIN (Liu et al.,
2015). The satirical news in the corpus is signif-
icantly less than true news, reﬂecting an impres-
sionistic view of the reality. We omit headline,
creation time, and author information so this work
concentrates on the satire in the article body. We
realize the corpus may contain different degree of
satire. Without the annotation, we only consider
binary classiﬁcation in this work and leave the de-
gree estimation for the future. The split and the
description of the dataset can be found in Table 3.

Implementation Detail

4.2
For SVM, we use the sklearn implementation7.
We ﬁnd that using linear kernel and setting
“class weight” to “balanced” mostly boost the re-
sult. We search soft-margin penalty “C” and ﬁnd
high results occur in range [10−1, 10−4]. We use
the validation set to tune the model so select-
ing hyper-parameters is consistent with neural net-
work based model.

For neural network based models, we use the
Theano package (Bastien et al., 2012) for imple-
mentation. The lengths of words, paragraphs,
and documents are ﬁxed at 24, 128, and 16 with
necessary padding or truncating. Stochastic Gra-
dient Descent is used with initial learning rate
of 0.3 and decay rate of 0.9. The training is
early stopped if the F1 drops 5 times continu-
ously. Word embeddings are initialized with 100-
dimension Glove embeddings (Pennington et al.,
2014). Character embeddings are randomly ini-
tialized with 30 dimensions. Speciﬁcally for the
proposed model, the following hyper-parameters
are estimated based on the validation set and used

in the ﬁnal test set. The dropout is applied with
probability of 0.5. The size of the hidden states is
set at 60. We use 30 ﬁlters with window size of 3
for convolution.

4.3 Performance of Satirical News Detection

We report accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 on
the validation set and the test set. All metrics
take satirical news as the positive class. Both
paragraph-level and document-level linguistic fea-
tures are scaled to have zero mean and unit vari-
ance, respectively. The compared methods in-
clude:

SVM word n-grams: Unigram and bigrams of
the words as the baseline. We report 1,2-grams
because it performs better than other n-grams.

SVM word n-grams + LF: 1,2-word grams
plus linguistic features. We omit comparison with
similar work (Ott et al., 2011) as their features are
subsumed in ours.

SVM word + char n-grams: 1,2-word grams

plus bigrams and trigrams of the characters.

SVM word + char n-grams + LF: All the pro-

posed features are considered.

SVM Rubin et al. (2016): Unigram and bi-
grams tf-idf with satirical features as proposed
in (Rubin et al., 2016). We compare with (Ru-
bin et al., 2016) rather than (Burfoot and Baldwin,
2009) as the former claims a better result.

SVM Rubin et al. (2016) + char tf-idf + LF:

Include all possible features.

Bi-GRU: Bi-GRU for document classiﬁcation.
The document representation is the average of the
hidden state at every time-step.

SVM Doc2Vec: Unsupervised method learning
distributed representation for documents (Le and
Mikolov, 2014). The implementation is based on

Gensim ( ˇReh˚uˇrek and Sojka, 2010).

HAN: Hierarchical Attention Network (Yang
et al., 2016b) for document classiﬁcation with both
word-level and sentence-level attention.

4LHN: 4-Level Hierarchical Network without

any linguistic features.

4LHNP: 4-Level Hierarchical Network with

Paragraph-level linguistic features.

4LHND: 4-Level Hierarchical Network with

Document-level linguistic features.

4LHNPD: 4-Level Hierarchical Network with
both Paragraph-level and Document-level linguis-
tic features.

In Table 4, the performances on the test set
are generally better than on the validation set due
to the cross-domain setting. We also explored
word-level attention (Yang et al., 2016b), but it
performed 2% worse than 4LHN. The result of
Doc2Vec is limited. We suspect the reason could
be the high imbalanced dataset, as an unsuper-
vised learning method for document representa-
tion heavily relies on the distribution of the doc-
ument.

to Table 5, we conclude satirical news mimics
true news by using news related words, such as
“stated” and “reporter”. However, these words
may be over used so they can be detected. True
news may use other evidence to support the cred-
ibility, which explains “twitter”, “com”, “video”,
and “pictured”. High weight of “ : ” indicates
that true news uses colon to list items for clarity.
High weight of “ '' ” indicates that satirical news
involves more conversation, which is consistent
with our observation. The ﬁnal interesting note is
satirical news favors “washington dc”. We suspect
that satirical news mostly covers politic topics, or
satire writers do not spend efforts on changing lo-
cations.

4.5 Analysis of Weighted Linguistic Features

We use 4LHNPD to compare paragraph-level and
document-level features, as 4LHNPD leverages
the two-level features into the same framework
and yields the best result.

Because all linguistic features are leveraged into
MLP with non-linear functions, it is hard to check
which feature indicates satire. Alternatively, we
deﬁne the importance of linguistic features by
summing the absolute value of the weights if di-
rectly connected to the feature. For example,
the importance I of feature k is given by Ik =
m=0 |wk,m|, where w ∈ RK×M is the di-
1
M
rectly connected weight, K is the number of fea-
tures, and M is the dimension of the output. This
metric gives a general idea about how much does
a feature contribute to the decision making.

(cid:80)M

We ﬁrst report the scaled importance of the four
linguistic feature sets by averaging the importance
of individual linguistic features. Then we report
individual important features within each set.

Figure 2: Comparing the importance of the four
feature sets at paragraph level and document level.

4.5.1 Comparing the Four Feature Sets

the importance of
According to Figure 2,
paragraph-level features is greater than document-
level features except for the readability feature
set. It is reasonable to use readability at the doc-
ument level because readability features evaluate
the understandability of a given text, which de-
pends on the content and the presentation. The
structural feature set is highly weighted for select-
ing attended paragraph, which inspires us to focus
on individual features inside the structural feature
set.

4.5.2 Comparing Individual Features

Within each set, we rank features based on the im-
portance score and report their mean and standard
deviation before being scaled in Table 6. At para-
graph level, we use top three attended paragraphs
for calculating. The respective p-values of all fea-
tures in the table are less than 0.01 based on the
t-test, indicating satirical news is statistically sig-
niﬁcantly different from true news.

Comparing Table 6 and Table 3, we ﬁnd that
the word count, capital letters, and punctuations
in true news are larger than in satirical news at
the document level, while at paragraph level these

Figure 3: An example of attended paragraphs.

features in true news are less than in satirical
news. This indicates satire paragraph could be
more complex locally.
It also could be referred
as “sentence complexity”, that “satirical articles
tend to pack a great number of clauses into a
sentence for comedic effect” (Rubin et al., 2016).
Accordingly, we hypothesize top complex para-
graphs could represent the entire satire document
for classiﬁcation, which we leave for future exam-
ination.

In Table 6, psycholinguistic feature “Humans”
is more related to emotional writing than con-
trol writing (Pennebaker et al., 2007), which in-
dicates satirical news is emotional and unprofes-
sional compared to true news. The same reason
also applies to “Social” and “Leisure”, where the
former implies emotional and the latter implies
control writing. The “Past” and “VBN” both have
higher frequencies in true news, which can be ex-
plained by the fact that true news covers what hap-
pened. A similar reason that true news reports
what happened to others explains a low “Self” and
a high “VBZ” in true news.

For writing stylistic features, it is suggested that
informative writing has more nouns, adjectives,
prepositions and coordinating conjunctions, while
imaginative writing has more verbs, adverbs, pro-
nouns, and pre-determiners (Rayson et al., 2001).
This explains higher frequencies of “RB” and
“PRP” in satirical news, and higher frequency of
“NN” and “CC” in true news. One exception is
“JJ”, adjectives, which receives the highest weight
in this feature set and indicates a higher frequency

in satirical news. We suspect adjective could also
be related to emotional writing, but more experi-
ments are required.

Readability suggests satirical news is easier to
be understood. Considering satirical news is also
deceptive (as the story is not true), this is consis-
tent with works (Frank et al., 2008; Afroz et al.,
2012) showing deceptive writings are more easily
comprehended than genuine writings. Finally, true
news has more digits and a higher “CD”(Cardinal
number) frequency, even at the paragraph level,
because they tend to be clear and accurate.

4.6 Visualization of Attended Paragraph

To explore the attention, we sample one example
in the validation set and present it in Figure 3. The
value at the right represents the scaled attention
score. The high attended paragraphs are longer
and have more capital letters as they are referring
different entities. They have more double quotes,
as multiple conversations are involved.

Moreover, we subjectively feel the attended
paragraph with score 0.98 has a sense of humor
while the paragraph with score 0.86 has a sense of
sarcasm, which are common in satire. The para-
graph with score 1.0 presents controversial topics,
which could be misleading if the reader cannot un-
derstand the satire. This is what we expect from
the attention mechanism. Based on the visualiza-
tion, we also feel this work could be generalized
to detect ﬁgurative languages.

5 Conclusion

In this paper, we proposed a 4-level hierarchical
network and utilized attention mechanism to un-
derstand satire at both paragraph level and doc-
ument level. The evaluation suggests readability
features support the ﬁnal classiﬁcation while psy-
cholinguistic features, writing stylistic features,
and structural features are beneﬁcial at the para-
graph level. In addition, although satirical news is
shorter than true news at the document level, we
ﬁnd satirical news generally contain paragraphs
which are more complex than true news at the
paragraph level. The analysis of individual fea-
tures reveals that the writing of satirical news tends
to be emotional and imaginative.

We will investigate efforts to model satire at the
paragraph level following our conclusion and the-
oretical backgrounds, such as (Ermida, 2012). We
plan to go beyond the binary classiﬁcation and ex-
plore satire degree estimation. We will generalize
our approach to reveal characteristics of ﬁgurative
language (Joshi et al., 2016), where different para-
graphs or sentences may reﬂect different degrees
of sarcasm, irony, and humor.

Abstract

Satirical news is considered to be enter-
tainment, but it is potentially deceptive
and harmful. Despite the embedded genre
in the article, not everyone can recognize
the satirical cues and therefore believe the
news as true news. We observe that satiri-
cal cues are often reﬂected in certain para-
graphs rather than the whole document.
Existing works only consider document-
level features to detect the satire, which
could be limited. We consider paragraph-
level linguistic features to unveil the satire
by incorporating neural network and atten-
tion mechanism. We investigate the differ-
ence between paragraph-level features and
document-level features, and analyze them
on a large satirical news dataset. The eval-
uation shows that the proposed model de-
tects satirical news effectively and reveals
what features are important at which level.

Introduction

“When information is cheap, attention
becomes expensive.” — James Gleick

Satirical news is considered to be entertainment.
However, it is not easy to recognize the satire if the
satirical cues are too subtle to be unmasked and the
reader lacks the contextual or cultural background.
The example illustrated in Table 1 is a piece of
satirical news with subtle satirical cues.

Assuming readers interpret satirical news as
true news, there is not much difference between
satirical news and fake news in terms of the con-
sequence, which may hurt the credibility of the
In fact, it is
media and the trust in the society.
reported in the Guardian that people may believe
satirical news and spread them to the public re-

...
“Kids these days are done with stories where things
happen,” said CBC consultant and world's oldest child
psychologist Obadiah Sugarman. “We'll ﬁnally be giv-
ing them the stiff Victorian morality that I assume is in
vogue. Not to mention, doing a period piece is a great
way to make sure white people are adequately repre-
sented on television.”

gardless of the ridiculous content1. It is also con-
cluded that fake news is similar to satirical news
via a thorough comparison among true news, fake
news, and satirical news (Horne and Adali, 2017).
This paper focuses on satirical news detection to
ensure the trustworthiness of online news and pre-
vent the spreading of potential misleading infor-
mation.

Some works tackling fake news and mislead-
ing information favor to discover the truth (Xiao
et al., 2016; Wan et al., 2016) through knowledge
base (Dong et al., 2015) and truthfulness estima-
tion (Ge et al., 2013). These approaches may
not be feasible for satirical news because there
is no ground-truth in the stories. Another track
of works analyze social network activities (Zhao
et al., 2015) to evaluate the spreading informa-
tion (Gupta et al., 2012; Castillo et al., 2011). This
could be ineffective for both fake news and satiri-
cal news because once they are distributed on the
social network, the damage has been done. Fi-
nally, works evaluating culture difference (P´erez-
Rosas and Mihalcea, 2014), psycholinguistic fea-
tures (Ott et al., 2011), and writing styles (Feng
et al., 2012) for deception detection are suitable
for satirical news detection. These works consider
features at document level, while we observe that
satirical cues are usually located in certain para-

fake-news-satire

graphs rather than the whole document. This in-
dicates that many document level features may be
superﬂuous and less effective.

To understand how paragraph-level features and
document-level features are varied towards detec-
tion decision when only document level labels are
available, we propose a 4-level neural network
in a character-word-paragraph-document hierar-
chy and utilize attention mechanism (Bahdanau
et al., 2014) to reveal their relative difference. We
apply psycholinguistic features, writing stylistic
features, structural features, and readability fea-
tures to understand satire. The paragraph-level
features are embedded into attention mechanism
for selecting highly attended paragraphs, and the
document-level features are incorporated for the
ﬁnal classiﬁcation. This is the ﬁrst work that un-
veils satirical cues between paragraph-level and
document-level through neural networks to our
knowledge.

We make the following contributions in our pa-

per:

• We propose a 4-level hierarchical network for
satirical news detection. The model detects
satirical news effectively and incorporates at-
tention mechanism to reveal paragraph-level
satirical cues.

• We show that paragraph-level features are
more important than document-level features
in terms of the psycholinguistic feature, writ-
ing stylistic feature, and structural feature,
while the readability feature is more impor-
tant at the document level.

• We collect satirical news (16,000+) and true
news (160,000+) from various sources and
conduct extensive experiments on this cor-
pus2.

2 Related Work

We categorize related works into four categories:
content-based detection for news genre, truth veri-
ﬁcation and truthfulness evaluation, deception de-
tection, and identiﬁcation of highly attended com-
ponent using attention mechanism.

social media. Burfoot and Baldwin (2009) intro-
duce headline features, profanity, and slang to
embody satirical news. They consider absurdity
as the major device in satirical news and model
this feature by comparing entity combination in a
given document with Google query results. Rubin
et al. (2016) also consider absurdity but model
it through unexpected new name entities. They
introduce additional features including humor,
grammar, negative affect, and punctuation to em-
power the detection. Besides satirical news, Chen
et al. (2015) aim to detect click-baits, whose
content exaggerates fact. Potthast et al. (2017)
report a writing style analysis of hyperpartisan
news. Barbieri et al. (2015) focus on multilingual
tweets that advertise satirical news.

It is noteworthy that satirical news used for
evaluation in above works are of limited quantity
(around 200 articles). Diverse examples of satire
may not be included as discussed by Rubin et al.
(2016). This issue inspires us to collect more than
16,000 satirical news for our experiment.

Truth discovery and truthfulness evalua-
tion. Although truth extraction from inconsistent
sources (Ge et al., 2013; Wan et al., 2016; Li et al.,
2016) and from conﬂicting sources (Yin et al.,
2008; Li et al., 2014b), truth inference through
knowledge base (Dong et al., 2015), and discov-
ering evolving truth (Li et al., 2015) could help
identify fact and detect fake news, they cannot fa-
vor much for satirical news as the story is entirely
made up and the ground-truth is hardly found.
Analyzing user activities (Farajtabar et al., 2017)
and interactions (Castillo et al., 2011; Mukher-
jee and Weikum, 2015) to evaluate the credibility
may not be appropriate for satirical news as it can-
not prevent the spreading. Therefore, we utilize
content-based features, including psycholinguistic
features, writing stylistic features, structural fea-
tures, and readability features, to address satirical
news detection.

Deception detection. We believe satirical
news and opinion spam share similar character-
istics of writing ﬁctitious and deceptive content,
which can be identiﬁed via a psycholinguistic con-
sideration (Mihalcea and Strapparava, 2009; Ott
et al., 2011). Beyond that, both syntactic sty-
lometry (Feng et al., 2012) and behavioral fea-
tures (Mukherjee et al., 2013b) are effective for de-
tecting deceptive reviews, while stylistic features
are practical to deal with obfuscating and imitat-

ing writings (Afroz et al., 2012). However, decep-
tive content varies among paragraphs in the same
document, and so does satire. We focus on de-
vising and evaluating paragraph-level features to
reveal the satire in this work. We compare them
with features at the document level, so we are able
to tell what features are important at which level.
Identiﬁcation of highly attended component
using attention mechanism. Attention mech-
anism is widely applied in machine transla-
tion (Bahdanau et al., 2014),
language infer-
ence (Rockt¨aschel et al., 2015), and question an-
In addition, Yang
swering (Chen et al., 2016a).
et al. (2016b) propose hierarchical attention net-
work to understand both attended words and sen-
tences for sentiment classiﬁcation. Chen et al.
(2016b) enhance the attention with the support of
user preference and product information to com-
prehend how user and product affect sentiment rat-
ings. Due to the capability of attention mecha-
nism, we employ the same strategy to show at-
tended component for satirical news. Different
from above works, we further evaluate linguis-
tic features of highly attended paragraphs to an-
alyze characteristics of satirical news, which has
not been explored to our knowledge.

3 The Proposed Model

We ﬁrst present our 4-level hierarchical neural
network and explain how linguistic features can
be embedded in the network to reveal the differ-
ence between paragraph level and document level.
Then we describe the linguistic features.

3.1 The 4-Level Hierarchical Model

We build the model in a hierarchy of character-
word-paragraph-document. The general overview
of the model can be viewed in Figure 1 and the
notations are listed in Table 2.

Table 2: Notations and meanings

Figure 1: The overview of the proposed model.
The document has 3 paragraphs and each para-
graph contains 4 words. We omit character-level
convolution neural network but leave xc to sym-
bolize the representation learned from it.

3.1.1 Character-Level Encoder

We use convolutional neural networks (CNN) to
encode word representation from characters. CNN
is effective in extracting morphological informa-
tion and name entities (Ma and Hovy, 2016), both
of which are common in news. Each word is pre-
sented as a sequence of n characters and each char-
acter is embedded into a low-dimension vector.
The sequence of characters c is brought to the net-
work. A convolution operation with a ﬁlter wc
is applied and moved along the sequence. Max
pooling is performed to select the most important
feature generated by the previous operation. The
word representation xc ∈ Rf is generated with f
ﬁlters.

3.1.2 Word-Level Encoder

i,t, as xi,t = [xc

Assume a sequence of words of paragraph i arrives
at time t. The current word representation xi,t
concatenates xc
i,t from character level with pre-
trained word embedding xe
i,t].
Examples are given in Figure 1. We implement
Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) (Cho et al., 2014)
rather than LSTM (Hochreiter and Schmidhuber,
1997) to encode the sequence because GRU has
fewer parameters. The GRU adopts reset gate
ri,t and update gate zi,t to control the informa-
tion ﬂow between the input xi,t and the candidate

i,t; xe

state ˜hi,t. The output hidden state hi,t is computed
by manipulating previous state hi,t−1 and the can-
didate state ˜hi,t regarding to zi,t as in Equation 4,
where (cid:12) denotes element-wise multiplication.

zi,t = σ(Wzxi,t + Uzhi,t−1 + bz)
ri,t = σ(Wrxi,t + Urhi,t−1 + br)
(2)
˜hi,t = tanh(Whxi,t + ri,t (cid:12) (Uhhi,t−1 + bh))
(3)

(1)

hi,t = (1 − zi,t) (cid:12) hi,t−1 + zi,t (cid:12) ˜hi,t

(4)

To learn a better representation from the past
and the future, we use bidirectional-GRU (Bi-
GRU) to read the sequence of words with for-
←−−
−−→
GRU from xi,1 to xi,t, and backward
GRU
ward
from xi,t to xi,1. The ﬁnal output of Bi-GRU
←−−
concatenates the last state of
GRU,
as [

←−
h i,1], to represent the ith paragraph.

−−→
GRU and

3.1.3 Paragraph-Level Attention

We observe that not all paragraphs have satire and
some of them are functional to make the article
complete, so we incorporate attention mechanism
to reveal which paragraphs contribute to decision
making. Assuming a sequence of paragraph repre-
sentations have been constructed from lower lev-
els, another Bi-GRU is used to encode these rep-
resentations to a series of new states p1:t, so the
sequential orders are considered.

To decide how paragraphs should be attended,
we calculate satirical degree αi of paragraph i. We
ﬁrst convey pi into hidden states ui as in Equa-
tion 5. Then we product ui with a learnable satire-
aware vector va and feed the result into softmax
function as in Equation 6. The ﬁnal document rep-
resentation d is computed as a weighted sum of αi
and pi.

ui = tanh(Wapi + ba)

αi =

exp(u(cid:62)
i va)
j=0 exp(u(cid:62)

j va))

Linguistic features are leveraged to support at-
tending satire paragraph. Besides pi, we represent
paragraph i based on our linguistic feature set and
transform it into a high-level feature vector lp
i via

multilayer perceptron (MLP). So ui in Equation 5
is updated to:

ui = tanh(Wapi + Ualp

i + ba)
3.1.4 Document-Level Classiﬁcation
Similar to the paragraph level, we represent doc-
ument j based on our linguistic feature set and
transform it into a high-level feature vector ld
j via
MLP. We concatenate dj and ld
j together for clas-
siﬁcation. Suppose yj ∈ (0, 1) is the label of the
document j, the prediction ˜yj and the loss func-
tion L over N documents are:

˜yj = sigmoid(Wddj + Udld

j + bd)

L = −

3.2 Linguistic Features

Linguistic features have been successfully applied
to expose differences between deceptive and gen-
uine content, so we subsume most of the features
in previous works. The idea of explaining ﬁcti-
tious content is extended here to reveal how satir-
ical news differs from true news. We divide our
linguistic features into four families and compute
them separately for paragraph and document.

Psycholinguistic Features: Psychological dif-
ferences are useful for our problem, because pro-
fessional journalists tend to express opinion con-
servatively to avoid unnecessary arguments. On
the contrary, satirical news includes aggressive
language for the entertainment purpose. We ad-
ditionally observe true news favors clarity and ac-
curacy while satirical news is related to emotional
cognition. To capture the above observations,
we employ Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count
(LIWC) (Pennebaker et al., 2007) as our psy-
cholinguistic dictionary. Each category of LIWC
is one independent feature and valued by its fre-
quency3.

Writing Stylistic Features: The relative distri-
bution of part-of-speech (POS) tags reﬂects infor-
mative vs. imaginative writing, which contributes
to detecting deceptions (Li et al., 2014a; Mukher-
jee et al., 2013a). We argue that the stories cov-
ered by satirical news are based on imagination.
In addition, POS tags are hints of the underlying

humor (Reyes et al., 2012), which is common in
satirical news. So we utilize POS tags (Toutanova
et al., 2003) to apprehend satire. Each tag is re-
garded as one independent feature and valued by
its frequency.

Readability Features: We consider readabil-
ity of genuine news would differ from satirical
news because the former is written by professional
journalists and tend to be clearer and more accu-
rate, while satirical news packs numerous clauses
to enrich the made-up story as introduced by Ru-
bin et al. (2016). Different from their work, we
use readability metrics, including Flesch Read-
ing Ease (Kincaid et al., 1975), Gunning Fog In-
dex (Gunning, 1952), Automated Readability In-
dex (Senter and Smith, 1967), ColemanLiau In-
dex (Coleman and Liau, 1975), and syllable count
per word, as features.

Structural Features: To further reﬂect the
structure of news articles, we examine the follow-
ing features: word count, log word count, number
of punctuations, number of digits, number of cap-
ital letters, and number of sentences.

4 Experiment and Evaluation

We report satirical news detection results and
show high weighted word features. Then, we pro-
vide a thorough analysis between paragraph-level
and document-level features. Finally, we visualize
an example of satirical news article to demonstrate
the effectiveness of our work.

4.1 Dataset

The satirical news is collected from 14 websites
that explicitly declare they are offering satire, so
the correct label can be guaranteed. We also no-
tice websites that mix true news, fake news, and
satirical news. We exclude these websites in this
work because it requires experts to annotate the
news articles.

We maintain each satire source in only one of
the train/validation/test sets4 as the cross-domain
4Train: Onion, the Spoof. Test: SatireWorld, Beaver-
ton, Ossurworld. Validation: DailyCurrent, DailyReport,

setting in (Li et al., 2014a). Otherwise, the prob-
lem may become writing pattern recognition or
news site classiﬁcation. We also combined dif-
ferent sources together5 as a similar setting of
leveraging multiple domains (Yang et al., 2016a).
The true news is collected from major news out-
lets6 and Google News using FLORIN (Liu et al.,
2015). The satirical news in the corpus is signif-
icantly less than true news, reﬂecting an impres-
sionistic view of the reality. We omit headline,
creation time, and author information so this work
concentrates on the satire in the article body. We
realize the corpus may contain different degree of
satire. Without the annotation, we only consider
binary classiﬁcation in this work and leave the de-
gree estimation for the future. The split and the
description of the dataset can be found in Table 3.

Implementation Detail

4.2
For SVM, we use the sklearn implementation7.
We ﬁnd that using linear kernel and setting
“class weight” to “balanced” mostly boost the re-
sult. We search soft-margin penalty “C” and ﬁnd
high results occur in range [10−1, 10−4]. We use
the validation set to tune the model so select-
ing hyper-parameters is consistent with neural net-
work based model.

For neural network based models, we use the
Theano package (Bastien et al., 2012) for imple-
mentation. The lengths of words, paragraphs,
and documents are ﬁxed at 24, 128, and 16 with
necessary padding or truncating. Stochastic Gra-
dient Descent is used with initial learning rate
of 0.3 and decay rate of 0.9. The training is
early stopped if the F1 drops 5 times continu-
ously. Word embeddings are initialized with 100-
dimension Glove embeddings (Pennington et al.,
2014). Character embeddings are randomly ini-
tialized with 30 dimensions. Speciﬁcally for the
proposed model, the following hyper-parameters
are estimated based on the validation set and used

amples and balanced validation/test sets.

in the ﬁnal test set. The dropout is applied with
probability of 0.5. The size of the hidden states is
set at 60. We use 30 ﬁlters with window size of 3
for convolution.

4.3 Performance of Satirical News Detection

We report accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 on
the validation set and the test set. All metrics
take satirical news as the positive class. Both
paragraph-level and document-level linguistic fea-
tures are scaled to have zero mean and unit vari-
ance, respectively. The compared methods in-
clude:

SVM word n-grams: Unigram and bigrams of
the words as the baseline. We report 1,2-grams
because it performs better than other n-grams.

SVM word n-grams + LF: 1,2-word grams
plus linguistic features. We omit comparison with
similar work (Ott et al., 2011) as their features are
subsumed in ours.

SVM word + char n-grams: 1,2-word grams

plus bigrams and trigrams of the characters.

SVM word + char n-grams + LF: All the pro-

posed features are considered.

SVM Rubin et al. (2016): Unigram and bi-
grams tf-idf with satirical features as proposed
in (Rubin et al., 2016). We compare with (Ru-
bin et al., 2016) rather than (Burfoot and Baldwin,
2009) as the former claims a better result.

SVM Rubin et al. (2016) + char tf-idf + LF:

Include all possible features.

Bi-GRU: Bi-GRU for document classiﬁcation.
The document representation is the average of the
hidden state at every time-step.

SVM Doc2Vec: Unsupervised method learning
distributed representation for documents (Le and
Mikolov, 2014). The implementation is based on

Gensim ( ˇReh˚uˇrek and Sojka, 2010).

HAN: Hierarchical Attention Network (Yang
et al., 2016b) for document classiﬁcation with both
word-level and sentence-level attention.

4LHN: 4-Level Hierarchical Network without

any linguistic features.

4LHNP: 4-Level Hierarchical Network with

Paragraph-level linguistic features.

4LHND: 4-Level Hierarchical Network with

Document-level linguistic features.

4LHNPD: 4-Level Hierarchical Network with
both Paragraph-level and Document-level linguis-
tic features.

In Table 4, the performances on the test set
are generally better than on the validation set due
to the cross-domain setting. We also explored
word-level attention (Yang et al., 2016b), but it
performed 2% worse than 4LHN. The result of
Doc2Vec is limited. We suspect the reason could
be the high imbalanced dataset, as an unsuper-
vised learning method for document representa-
tion heavily relies on the distribution of the doc-
ument.

to Table 5, we conclude satirical news mimics
true news by using news related words, such as
“stated” and “reporter”. However, these words
may be over used so they can be detected. True
news may use other evidence to support the cred-
ibility, which explains “twitter”, “com”, “video”,
and “pictured”. High weight of “ : ” indicates
that true news uses colon to list items for clarity.
High weight of “ '' ” indicates that satirical news
involves more conversation, which is consistent
with our observation. The ﬁnal interesting note is
satirical news favors “washington dc”. We suspect
that satirical news mostly covers politic topics, or
satire writers do not spend efforts on changing lo-
cations.

4.5 Analysis of Weighted Linguistic Features

We use 4LHNPD to compare paragraph-level and
document-level features, as 4LHNPD leverages
the two-level features into the same framework
and yields the best result.

Because all linguistic features are leveraged into
MLP with non-linear functions, it is hard to check
which feature indicates satire. Alternatively, we
deﬁne the importance of linguistic features by
summing the absolute value of the weights if di-
rectly connected to the feature. For example,
the importance I of feature k is given by Ik =
m=0 |wk,m|, where w ∈ RK×M is the di-
1
M
rectly connected weight, K is the number of fea-
tures, and M is the dimension of the output. This
metric gives a general idea about how much does
a feature contribute to the decision making.

(cid:80)M

We ﬁrst report the scaled importance of the four
linguistic feature sets by averaging the importance
of individual linguistic features. Then we report
individual important features within each set.

Figure 2: Comparing the importance of the four
feature sets at paragraph level and document level.

4.5.1 Comparing the Four Feature Sets

the importance of
According to Figure 2,
paragraph-level features is greater than document-
level features except for the readability feature
set. It is reasonable to use readability at the doc-
ument level because readability features evaluate
the understandability of a given text, which de-
pends on the content and the presentation. The
structural feature set is highly weighted for select-
ing attended paragraph, which inspires us to focus
on individual features inside the structural feature
set.

4.5.2 Comparing Individual Features

Within each set, we rank features based on the im-
portance score and report their mean and standard
deviation before being scaled in Table 6. At para-
graph level, we use top three attended paragraphs
for calculating. The respective p-values of all fea-
tures in the table are less than 0.01 based on the
t-test, indicating satirical news is statistically sig-
niﬁcantly different from true news.

Comparing Table 6 and Table 3, we ﬁnd that
the word count, capital letters, and punctuations
in true news are larger than in satirical news at
the document level, while at paragraph level these

Figure 3: An example of attended paragraphs.

features in true news are less than in satirical
news. This indicates satire paragraph could be
more complex locally.
It also could be referred
as “sentence complexity”, that “satirical articles
tend to pack a great number of clauses into a
sentence for comedic effect” (Rubin et al., 2016).
Accordingly, we hypothesize top complex para-
graphs could represent the entire satire document
for classiﬁcation, which we leave for future exam-
ination.

In Table 6, psycholinguistic feature “Humans”
is more related to emotional writing than con-
trol writing (Pennebaker et al., 2007), which in-
dicates satirical news is emotional and unprofes-
sional compared to true news. The same reason
also applies to “Social” and “Leisure”, where the
former implies emotional and the latter implies
control writing. The “Past” and “VBN” both have
higher frequencies in true news, which can be ex-
plained by the fact that true news covers what hap-
pened. A similar reason that true news reports
what happened to others explains a low “Self” and
a high “VBZ” in true news.

For writing stylistic features, it is suggested that
informative writing has more nouns, adjectives,
prepositions and coordinating conjunctions, while
imaginative writing has more verbs, adverbs, pro-
nouns, and pre-determiners (Rayson et al., 2001).
This explains higher frequencies of “RB” and
“PRP” in satirical news, and higher frequency of
“NN” and “CC” in true news. One exception is
“JJ”, adjectives, which receives the highest weight
in this feature set and indicates a higher frequency

in satirical news. We suspect adjective could also
be related to emotional writing, but more experi-
ments are required.

Readability suggests satirical news is easier to
be understood. Considering satirical news is also
deceptive (as the story is not true), this is consis-
tent with works (Frank et al., 2008; Afroz et al.,
2012) showing deceptive writings are more easily
comprehended than genuine writings. Finally, true
news has more digits and a higher “CD”(Cardinal
number) frequency, even at the paragraph level,
because they tend to be clear and accurate.

4.6 Visualization of Attended Paragraph

To explore the attention, we sample one example
in the validation set and present it in Figure 3. The
value at the right represents the scaled attention
score. The high attended paragraphs are longer
and have more capital letters as they are referring
different entities. They have more double quotes,
as multiple conversations are involved.

Moreover, we subjectively feel the attended
paragraph with score 0.98 has a sense of humor
while the paragraph with score 0.86 has a sense of
sarcasm, which are common in satire. The para-
graph with score 1.0 presents controversial topics,
which could be misleading if the reader cannot un-
derstand the satire. This is what we expect from
the attention mechanism. Based on the visualiza-
tion, we also feel this work could be generalized
to detect ﬁgurative languages.

5 Conclusion

In this paper, we proposed a 4-level hierarchical
network and utilized attention mechanism to un-
derstand satire at both paragraph level and doc-
ument level. The evaluation suggests readability
features support the ﬁnal classiﬁcation while psy-
cholinguistic features, writing stylistic features,
and structural features are beneﬁcial at the para-
graph level. In addition, although satirical news is
shorter than true news at the document level, we
ﬁnd satirical news generally contain paragraphs
which are more complex than true news at the
paragraph level. The analysis of individual fea-
tures reveals that the writing of satirical news tends
to be emotional and imaginative.

We will investigate efforts to model satire at the
paragraph level following our conclusion and the-
oretical backgrounds, such as (Ermida, 2012). We
plan to go beyond the binary classiﬁcation and ex-
plore satire degree estimation. We will generalize
our approach to reveal characteristics of ﬁgurative
language (Joshi et al., 2016), where different para-
graphs or sentences may reﬂect different degrees
of sarcasm, irony, and humor.

Abstract

Satirical news is considered to be enter-
tainment, but it is potentially deceptive
and harmful. Despite the embedded genre
in the article, not everyone can recognize
the satirical cues and therefore believe the
news as true news. We observe that satiri-
cal cues are often reﬂected in certain para-
graphs rather than the whole document.
Existing works only consider document-
level features to detect the satire, which
could be limited. We consider paragraph-
level linguistic features to unveil the satire
by incorporating neural network and atten-
tion mechanism. We investigate the differ-
ence between paragraph-level features and
document-level features, and analyze them
on a large satirical news dataset. The eval-
uation shows that the proposed model de-
tects satirical news effectively and reveals
what features are important at which level.

Introduction

“When information is cheap, attention
becomes expensive.” — James Gleick

Satirical news is considered to be entertainment.
However, it is not easy to recognize the satire if the
satirical cues are too subtle to be unmasked and the
reader lacks the contextual or cultural background.
The example illustrated in Table 1 is a piece of
satirical news with subtle satirical cues.

Assuming readers interpret satirical news as
true news, there is not much difference between
satirical news and fake news in terms of the con-
sequence, which may hurt the credibility of the

reported in the Guardian that people may believe
satirical news and spread them to the public re-

“Kids these days are done with stories where things
happen,” said CBC consultant and world's oldest child
psychologist Obadiah Sugarman. “We'll ﬁnally be giv-

way to make sure white people are adequately repre-
sented on television.”

gardless of the ridiculous content1. It is also con-
cluded that fake news is similar to satirical news
via a thorough comparison among true news, fake
news, and satirical news (Horne and Adali, 2017).
This paper focuses on satirical news detection to
ensure the trustworthiness of online news and pre-
vent the spreading of potential misleading infor-
mation.

Some works tackling fake news and mislead-
ing information favor to discover the truth (Xiao
et al., 2016; Wan et al., 2016) through knowledge
base (Dong et al., 2015) and truthfulness estima-
tion (Ge et al., 2013). These approaches may
not be feasible for satirical news because there
is no ground-truth in the stories. Another track
of works analyze social network activities (Zhao
et al., 2015) to evaluate the spreading informa-
tion (Gupta et al., 2012; Castillo et al., 2011). This
could be ineffective for both fake news and satiri-
cal news because once they are distributed on the
social network, the damage has been done. Fi-
nally, works evaluating culture difference (P´erez-
Rosas and Mihalcea, 2014), psycholinguistic fea-
tures (Ott et al., 2011), and writing styles (Feng
et al., 2012) for deception detection are suitable
for satirical news detection. These works consider
features at document level, while we observe that
satirical cues are usually located in certain para-

fake-news-satire

graphs rather than the whole document. This in-
dicates that many document level features may be
superﬂuous and less effective.

To understand how paragraph-level features and
document-level features are varied towards detec-
tion decision when only document level labels are
available, we propose a 4-level neural network
in a character-word-paragraph-document hierar-
chy and utilize attention mechanism (Bahdanau
et al., 2014) to reveal their relative difference. We
apply psycholinguistic features, writing stylistic
features, structural features, and readability fea-
tures to understand satire. The paragraph-level
features are embedded into attention mechanism
for selecting highly attended paragraphs, and the
document-level features are incorporated for the
ﬁnal classiﬁcation. This is the ﬁrst work that un-
veils satirical cues between paragraph-level and
document-level through neural networks to our
knowledge.

We make the following contributions in our pa-

per:

• We propose a 4-level hierarchical network for
satirical news detection. The model detects
satirical news effectively and incorporates at-
tention mechanism to reveal paragraph-level
satirical cues.

• We show that paragraph-level features are
more important than document-level features
in terms of the psycholinguistic feature, writ-
ing stylistic feature, and structural feature,
while the readability feature is more impor-
tant at the document level.

• We collect satirical news (16,000+) and true
news (160,000+) from various sources and
conduct extensive experiments on this cor-
pus2.

2 Related Work

We categorize related works into four categories:
content-based detection for news genre, truth veri-
ﬁcation and truthfulness evaluation, deception de-
tection, and identiﬁcation of highly attended com-
ponent using attention mechanism.

social media. Burfoot and Baldwin (2009) intro-
duce headline features, profanity, and slang to
embody satirical news. They consider absurdity
as the major device in satirical news and model
this feature by comparing entity combination in a
given document with Google query results. Rubin
et al. (2016) also consider absurdity but model
it through unexpected new name entities. They
introduce additional features including humor,
grammar, negative affect, and punctuation to em-
power the detection. Besides satirical news, Chen
et al. (2015) aim to detect click-baits, whose
content exaggerates fact. Potthast et al. (2017)
report a writing style analysis of hyperpartisan
news. Barbieri et al. (2015) focus on multilingual
tweets that advertise satirical news.

It is noteworthy that satirical news used for
evaluation in above works are of limited quantity
(around 200 articles). Diverse examples of satire
may not be included as discussed by Rubin et al.
(2016). This issue inspires us to collect more than
16,000 satirical news for our experiment.

Truth discovery and truthfulness evalua-
tion. Although truth extraction from inconsistent
sources (Ge et al., 2013; Wan et al., 2016; Li et al.,
2016) and from conﬂicting sources (Yin et al.,
2008; Li et al., 2014b), truth inference through
knowledge base (Dong et al., 2015), and discov-
ering evolving truth (Li et al., 2015) could help
identify fact and detect fake news, they cannot fa-
vor much for satirical news as the story is entirely
made up and the ground-truth is hardly found.
Analyzing user activities (Farajtabar et al., 2017)
and interactions (Castillo et al., 2011; Mukher-
jee and Weikum, 2015) to evaluate the credibility
may not be appropriate for satirical news as it can-
not prevent the spreading. Therefore, we utilize
content-based features, including psycholinguistic
features, writing stylistic features, structural fea-
tures, and readability features, to address satirical
news detection.

Deception detection. We believe satirical
news and opinion spam share similar character-
istics of writing ﬁctitious and deceptive content,
which can be identiﬁed via a psycholinguistic con-
sideration (Mihalcea and Strapparava, 2009; Ott
et al., 2011). Beyond that, both syntactic sty-
lometry (Feng et al., 2012) and behavioral fea-
tures (Mukherjee et al., 2013b) are effective for de-
tecting deceptive reviews, while stylistic features
are practical to deal with obfuscating and imitat-

ing writings (Afroz et al., 2012). However, decep-
tive content varies among paragraphs in the same
document, and so does satire. We focus on de-
vising and evaluating paragraph-level features to
reveal the satire in this work. We compare them
with features at the document level, so we are able
to tell what features are important at which level.
Identiﬁcation of highly attended component

anism is widely applied in machine transla-
tion (Bahdanau et al., 2014),
language infer-
ence (Rockt¨aschel et al., 2015), and question an-
In addition, Yang
swering (Chen et al., 2016a).
et al. (2016b) propose hierarchical attention net-
work to understand both attended words and sen-
tences for sentiment classiﬁcation. Chen et al.
(2016b) enhance the attention with the support of
user preference and product information to com-
prehend how user and product affect sentiment rat-
ings. Due to the capability of attention mecha-
nism, we employ the same strategy to show at-
tended component for satirical news. Different
from above works, we further evaluate linguis-
tic features of highly attended paragraphs to an-
alyze characteristics of satirical news, which has
not been explored to our knowledge.

3 The Proposed Model

We ﬁrst present our 4-level hierarchical neural
network and explain how linguistic features can
be embedded in the network to reveal the differ-
ence between paragraph level and document level.
Then we describe the linguistic features.

3.1 The 4-Level Hierarchical Model

We build the model in a hierarchy of character-
word-paragraph-document. The general overview
of the model can be viewed in Figure 1 and the
notations are listed in Table 2.

Figure 1: The overview of the proposed model.
The document has 3 paragraphs and each para-
graph contains 4 words. We omit character-level
convolution neural network but leave xc to sym-
bolize the representation learned from it.

3.1.1 Character-Level Encoder

We use convolutional neural networks (CNN) to
encode word representation from characters. CNN
is effective in extracting morphological informa-
tion and name entities (Ma and Hovy, 2016), both
of which are common in news. Each word is pre-
sented as a sequence of n characters and each char-
acter is embedded into a low-dimension vector.
The sequence of characters c is brought to the net-
work. A convolution operation with a ﬁlter wc
is applied and moved along the sequence. Max
pooling is performed to select the most important
feature generated by the previous operation. The
word representation xc ∈ Rf is generated with f
ﬁlters.

3.1.2 Word-Level Encoder

i,t, as xi,t = [xc

Assume a sequence of words of paragraph i arrives
at time t. The current word representation xi,t
concatenates xc
i,t from character level with pre-
trained word embedding xe
i,t].
Examples are given in Figure 1. We implement
Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) (Cho et al., 2014)
rather than LSTM (Hochreiter and Schmidhuber,
1997) to encode the sequence because GRU has
fewer parameters. The GRU adopts reset gate
ri,t and update gate zi,t to control the informa-
tion ﬂow between the input xi,t and the candidate

i,t; xe

state ˜hi,t. The output hidden state hi,t is computed
by manipulating previous state hi,t−1 and the can-
didate state ˜hi,t regarding to zi,t as in Equation 4,
where (cid:12) denotes element-wise multiplication.

zi,t = σ(Wzxi,t + Uzhi,t−1 + bz)
ri,t = σ(Wrxi,t + Urhi,t−1 + br)
(2)
˜hi,t = tanh(Whxi,t + ri,t (cid:12) (Uhhi,t−1 + bh))
(3)

(1)

hi,t = (1 − zi,t) (cid:12) hi,t−1 + zi,t (cid:12) ˜hi,t

(4)

To learn a better representation from the past
and the future, we use bidirectional-GRU (Bi-
GRU) to read the sequence of words with for-
←−−
−−→
GRU from xi,1 to xi,t, and backward
GRU

from xi,t to xi,1. The ﬁnal output of Bi-GRU

concatenates the last state of
GRU,
as [

3.1.3 Paragraph-Level Attention

We observe that not all paragraphs have satire and
some of them are functional to make the article
complete, so we incorporate attention mechanism
to reveal which paragraphs contribute to decision
making. Assuming a sequence of paragraph repre-
sentations have been constructed from lower lev-
els, another Bi-GRU is used to encode these rep-
resentations to a series of new states p1:t, so the
sequential orders are considered.

To decide how paragraphs should be attended,
we calculate satirical degree αi of paragraph i. We
ﬁrst convey pi into hidden states ui as in Equa-
tion 5. Then we product ui with a learnable satire-
aware vector va and feed the result into softmax
function as in Equation 6. The ﬁnal document rep-
resentation d is computed as a weighted sum of αi
and pi.

ui = tanh(Wapi + ba)

αi =

exp(u(cid:62)
i va)
j=0 exp(u(cid:62)

j va))

(cid:80)t

d =

αipi

t
(cid:88)

i=0

(7)

Linguistic features are leveraged to support at-
tending satire paragraph. Besides pi, we represent
paragraph i based on our linguistic feature set and
transform it into a high-level feature vector lp
i via

multilayer perceptron (MLP). So ui in Equation 5
is updated to:

(8)

ui = tanh(Wapi + Ualp

i + ba)
3.1.4 Document-Level Classiﬁcation
Similar to the paragraph level, we represent doc-
ument j based on our linguistic feature set and
transform it into a high-level feature vector ld
j via
MLP. We concatenate dj and ld
j together for clas-
siﬁcation. Suppose yj ∈ (0, 1) is the label of the
document j, the prediction ˜yj and the loss func-
tion L over N documents are:

˜yj = sigmoid(Wddj + Udld

j + bd)

L = −

yj log ˜yj + (1 − yj) log(1 − ˜yj)

3.2 Linguistic Features

Linguistic features have been successfully applied
to expose differences between deceptive and gen-
uine content, so we subsume most of the features
in previous works. The idea of explaining ﬁcti-
tious content is extended here to reveal how satir-
ical news differs from true news. We divide our
linguistic features into four families and compute
them separately for paragraph and document.

Psycholinguistic Features: Psychological dif-
ferences are useful for our problem, because pro-
fessional journalists tend to express opinion con-
servatively to avoid unnecessary arguments. On
the contrary, satirical news includes aggressive
language for the entertainment purpose. We ad-
ditionally observe true news favors clarity and ac-
curacy while satirical news is related to emotional
cognition. To capture the above observations,
we employ Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count
(LIWC) (Pennebaker et al., 2007) as our psy-
cholinguistic dictionary. Each category of LIWC
is one independent feature and valued by its fre-
quency3.

Writing Stylistic Features: The relative distri-
bution of part-of-speech (POS) tags reﬂects infor-
mative vs. imaginative writing, which contributes
to detecting deceptions (Li et al., 2014a; Mukher-
jee et al., 2013a). We argue that the stories cov-
ered by satirical news are based on imagination.
In addition, POS tags are hints of the underlying

humor (Reyes et al., 2012), which is common in
satirical news. So we utilize POS tags (Toutanova
et al., 2003) to apprehend satire. Each tag is re-
garded as one independent feature and valued by
its frequency.

Readability Features: We consider readabil-
ity of genuine news would differ from satirical
news because the former is written by professional
journalists and tend to be clearer and more accu-
rate, while satirical news packs numerous clauses
to enrich the made-up story as introduced by Ru-
bin et al. (2016). Different from their work, we
use readability metrics, including Flesch Read-
ing Ease (Kincaid et al., 1975), Gunning Fog In-
dex (Gunning, 1952), Automated Readability In-
dex (Senter and Smith, 1967), ColemanLiau In-
dex (Coleman and Liau, 1975), and syllable count
per word, as features.

Structural Features: To further reﬂect the
structure of news articles, we examine the follow-
ing features: word count, log word count, number
of punctuations, number of digits, number of cap-
ital letters, and number of sentences.

4 Experiment and Evaluation

We report satirical news detection results and
show high weighted word features. Then, we pro-
vide a thorough analysis between paragraph-level
and document-level features. Finally, we visualize
an example of satirical news article to demonstrate
the effectiveness of our work.

4.1 Dataset

The satirical news is collected from 14 websites
that explicitly declare they are offering satire, so
the correct label can be guaranteed. We also no-
tice websites that mix true news, fake news, and
satirical news. We exclude these websites in this
work because it requires experts to annotate the
news articles.

We maintain each satire source in only one of
the train/validation/test sets4 as the cross-domain

setting in (Li et al., 2014a). Otherwise, the prob-
lem may become writing pattern recognition or
news site classiﬁcation. We also combined dif-
ferent sources together5 as a similar setting of
leveraging multiple domains (Yang et al., 2016a).
The true news is collected from major news out-
lets6 and Google News using FLORIN (Liu et al.,
2015). The satirical news in the corpus is signif-
icantly less than true news, reﬂecting an impres-
sionistic view of the reality. We omit headline,
creation time, and author information so this work
concentrates on the satire in the article body. We
realize the corpus may contain different degree of
satire. Without the annotation, we only consider
binary classiﬁcation in this work and leave the de-
gree estimation for the future. The split and the
description of the dataset can be found in Table 3.

We ﬁnd that using linear kernel and setting
“class weight” to “balanced” mostly boost the re-
sult. We search soft-margin penalty “C” and ﬁnd
high results occur in range [10−1, 10−4]. We use
the validation set to tune the model so select-
ing hyper-parameters is consistent with neural net-
work based model.

For neural network based models, we use the
Theano package (Bastien et al., 2012) for imple-
mentation. The lengths of words, paragraphs,
and documents are ﬁxed at 24, 128, and 16 with
necessary padding or truncating. Stochastic Gra-
dient Descent is used with initial learning rate
of 0.3 and decay rate of 0.9. The training is
early stopped if the F1 drops 5 times continu-
ously. Word embeddings are initialized with 100-
dimension Glove embeddings (Pennington et al.,
2014). Character embeddings are randomly ini-
tialized with 30 dimensions. Speciﬁcally for the
proposed model, the following hyper-parameters
are estimated based on the validation set and used

in the ﬁnal test set. The dropout is applied with
probability of 0.5. The size of the hidden states is
set at 60. We use 30 ﬁlters with window size of 3
for convolution.

4.3 Performance of Satirical News Detection

We report accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 on
the validation set and the test set. All metrics
take satirical news as the positive class. Both
paragraph-level and document-level linguistic fea-
tures are scaled to have zero mean and unit vari-
ance, respectively. The compared methods in-
clude:

SVM word n-grams: Unigram and bigrams of
the words as the baseline. We report 1,2-grams
because it performs better than other n-grams.

SVM word n-grams + LF: 1,2-word grams
plus linguistic features. We omit comparison with
similar work (Ott et al., 2011) as their features are
subsumed in ours.

SVM word + char n-grams: 1,2-word grams

plus bigrams and trigrams of the characters.

SVM word + char n-grams + LF: All the pro-

posed features are considered.

SVM Rubin et al. (2016): Unigram and bi-
grams tf-idf with satirical features as proposed
in (Rubin et al., 2016). We compare with (Ru-
bin et al., 2016) rather than (Burfoot and Baldwin,
2009) as the former claims a better result.

SVM Rubin et al. (2016) + char tf-idf + LF:

Include all possible features.

Bi-GRU: Bi-GRU for document classiﬁcation.
The document representation is the average of the
hidden state at every time-step.

SVM Doc2Vec: Unsupervised method learning
distributed representation for documents (Le and
Mikolov, 2014). The implementation is based on

Gensim ( ˇReh˚uˇrek and Sojka, 2010).

HAN: Hierarchical Attention Network (Yang
et al., 2016b) for document classiﬁcation with both
word-level and sentence-level attention.

4LHN: 4-Level Hierarchical Network without

any linguistic features.

4LHNP: 4-Level Hierarchical Network with

Paragraph-level linguistic features.

4LHND: 4-Level Hierarchical Network with

Document-level linguistic features.

4LHNPD: 4-Level Hierarchical Network with
both Paragraph-level and Document-level linguis-
tic features.

In Table 4, the performances on the test set
are generally better than on the validation set due
to the cross-domain setting. We also explored
word-level attention (Yang et al., 2016b), but it
performed 2% worse than 4LHN. The result of
Doc2Vec is limited. We suspect the reason could
be the high imbalanced dataset, as an unsuper-
vised learning method for document representa-
tion heavily relies on the distribution of the doc-
ument.

to Table 5, we conclude satirical news mimics
true news by using news related words, such as
“stated” and “reporter”. However, these words
may be over used so they can be detected. True
news may use other evidence to support the cred-
ibility, which explains “twitter”, “com”, “video”,
and “pictured”. High weight of “ : ” indicates
that true news uses colon to list items for clarity.
High weight of “ '' ” indicates that satirical news
involves more conversation, which is consistent
with our observation. The ﬁnal interesting note is
satirical news favors “washington dc”. We suspect
that satirical news mostly covers politic topics, or
satire writers do not spend efforts on changing lo-
cations.

4.5 Analysis of Weighted Linguistic Features

We use 4LHNPD to compare paragraph-level and
document-level features, as 4LHNPD leverages
the two-level features into the same framework
and yields the best result.

Because all linguistic features are leveraged into
MLP with non-linear functions, it is hard to check
which feature indicates satire. Alternatively, we
deﬁne the importance of linguistic features by
summing the absolute value of the weights if di-
rectly connected to the feature. For example,
the importance I of feature k is given by Ik =
m=0 |wk,m|, where w ∈ RK×M is the di-
1
M
rectly connected weight, K is the number of fea-
tures, and M is the dimension of the output. This
metric gives a general idea about how much does
a feature contribute to the decision making.

(cid:80)M

We ﬁrst report the scaled importance of the four
linguistic feature sets by averaging the importance
of individual linguistic features. Then we report
individual important features within each set.

Figure 2: Comparing the importance of the four
feature sets at paragraph level and document level.

4.5.1 Comparing the Four Feature Sets

the importance of
According to Figure 2,
paragraph-level features is greater than document-
level features except for the readability feature
set. It is reasonable to use readability at the doc-
ument level because readability features evaluate
the understandability of a given text, which de-
pends on the content and the presentation. The
structural feature set is highly weighted for select-
ing attended paragraph, which inspires us to focus
on individual features inside the structural feature
set.

4.5.2 Comparing Individual Features

Within each set, we rank features based on the im-
portance score and report their mean and standard
deviation before being scaled in Table 6. At para-
graph level, we use top three attended paragraphs
for calculating. The respective p-values of all fea-
tures in the table are less than 0.01 based on the
t-test, indicating satirical news is statistically sig-
niﬁcantly different from true news.

Comparing Table 6 and Table 3, we ﬁnd that
the word count, capital letters, and punctuations
in true news are larger than in satirical news at
the document level, while at paragraph level these

Figure 3: An example of attended paragraphs.

features in true news are less than in satirical
news. This indicates satire paragraph could be
more complex locally.
It also could be referred
as “sentence complexity”, that “satirical articles
tend to pack a great number of clauses into a
sentence for comedic effect” (Rubin et al., 2016).
Accordingly, we hypothesize top complex para-
graphs could represent the entire satire document
for classiﬁcation, which we leave for future exam-
ination.

In Table 6, psycholinguistic feature “Humans”
is more related to emotional writing than con-
trol writing (Pennebaker et al., 2007), which in-
dicates satirical news is emotional and unprofes-
sional compared to true news. The same reason
also applies to “Social” and “Leisure”, where the
former implies emotional and the latter implies
control writing. The “Past” and “VBN” both have
higher frequencies in true news, which can be ex-
plained by the fact that true news covers what hap-
pened. A similar reason that true news reports
what happened to others explains a low “Self” and
a high “VBZ” in true news.

For writing stylistic features, it is suggested that
informative writing has more nouns, adjectives,
prepositions and coordinating conjunctions, while
imaginative writing has more verbs, adverbs, pro-
nouns, and pre-determiners (Rayson et al., 2001).
This explains higher frequencies of “RB” and
“PRP” in satirical news, and higher frequency of
“NN” and “CC” in true news. One exception is
“JJ”, adjectives, which receives the highest weight
in this feature set and indicates a higher frequency

in satirical news. We suspect adjective could also
be related to emotional writing, but more experi-
ments are required.

Readability suggests satirical news is easier to
be understood. Considering satirical news is also
deceptive (as the story is not true), this is consis-
tent with works (Frank et al., 2008; Afroz et al.,
2012) showing deceptive writings are more easily
comprehended than genuine writings. Finally, true
news has more digits and a higher “CD”(Cardinal
number) frequency, even at the paragraph level,
because they tend to be clear and accurate.

4.6 Visualization of Attended Paragraph

To explore the attention, we sample one example
in the validation set and present it in Figure 3. The
value at the right represents the scaled attention
score. The high attended paragraphs are longer
and have more capital letters as they are referring
different entities. They have more double quotes,
as multiple conversations are involved.

Moreover, we subjectively feel the attended
paragraph with score 0.98 has a sense of humor
while the paragraph with score 0.86 has a sense of
sarcasm, which are common in satire. The para-
graph with score 1.0 presents controversial topics,
which could be misleading if the reader cannot un-
derstand the satire. This is what we expect from
the attention mechanism. Based on the visualiza-
tion, we also feel this work could be generalized
to detect ﬁgurative languages.

5 Conclusion

In this paper, we proposed a 4-level hierarchical
network and utilized attention mechanism to un-
derstand satire at both paragraph level and doc-
ument level. The evaluation suggests readability
features support the ﬁnal classiﬁcation while psy-
cholinguistic features, writing stylistic features,
and structural features are beneﬁcial at the para-
graph level. In addition, although satirical news is
shorter than true news at the document level, we
ﬁnd satirical news generally contain paragraphs
which are more complex than true news at the
paragraph level. The analysis of individual fea-
tures reveals that the writing of satirical news tends
to be emotional and imaginative.

We will investigate efforts to model satire at the
paragraph level following our conclusion and the-
oretical backgrounds, such as (Ermida, 2012). We
plan to go beyond the binary classiﬁcation and ex-
plore satire degree estimation. We will generalize
our approach to reveal characteristics of ﬁgurative
language (Joshi et al., 2016), where different para-
graphs or sentences may reﬂect different degrees
of sarcasm, irony, and humor.
