Abstract

In this paper, we describe ROOT 18, a classiﬁer using the scores of several unsupervised dis-
tributional measures as features to discriminate between semantically related and unrelated
words, and then to classify the related pairs according to their semantic relation (i.e. synonymy,
antonymy, hypernymy, part-whole meronymy). Our classiﬁer participated in the CogALex-V
Shared Task, showing a solid performance on the ﬁrst subtask, but a poor performance on the
second subtask. The low scores reported on the second subtask suggest that distributional mea-
sures are not sufﬁcient to discriminate between multiple semantic relations at once.

1 Introduction

The system described in this paper has been designed for the CogALex-V Shared Task, focusing on
the corpus-based identiﬁcation of semantic relations. Since Distributional Semantic Models (henceforth
DSMs) were proposed as a special topic of interest for the current edition of the CogALex workshop,
we decided to base our classiﬁer on a number of distributional measures that have been used by past
Natural Language Processing (NLP) research to discriminate between a speciﬁc semantic relation and
other relation types.

The task is splitted into the following subtasks:

• for each word pair, the participating systems have to decide whether the terms are semantically

related or not (TRUE and FALSE are the only possible outcomes);

• for each word pair, the participating systems have to decide which semantic relation holds between
the terms of the pair. The ﬁve possible semantic relations are synonymy (SYN), antonymy (ANT),
hypernymy (HYPER), meronymy (PART OF) and no semantic relation at all (RANDOM).

Our system managed to achieve good results in discriminating between related and random pairs in
the ﬁrst subtask, but unfortunately it struggled in the second one, also due to the high difﬁculty of the
task itself. In particular, the recall for some of the semantic relations of interest seems to be extremely
low, suggesting that our unsupervised distributional measures do not provide sufﬁcient information to
characterize them, and that it could be probably useful to integrate such scores with other sources of
evidence (e.g. information on lexical patterns of word co-occurrence).

The paper is organized as follows: in section 2, we summarize related works on the task of semantic
relation identiﬁcation; in section 3, we introduce our system, by describing the classiﬁer and the features.
Finally, in section 4 we present and discuss our results.

2 The Task: Related Work

Distinguishing between related and unrelated words and, then, discriminating among semantic relations
are very important tasks in NLP, and they have a wide range of applications, such as textual entailment,
text summarization, sentiment analysis, ontology learning, and so on. For this reason, several systems

over the last few years have been proposed to tackle this problem, using both unsupervised and supervised
approaches (see the works of Lenci and Benotto (2012) and Shwartz et al. (2016) on hypernymy; Weeds
et al. (2014) and Santus et al. (2016a) on hypernymy and co-hyponymy; Mohammad et al. (2013)
and Santus et al.
(2014) on antonymy). However, many of these works focus on a single semantic
relation, e.g. antonymy, and describe methods or measures to set it apart from other relations. There
have not been many attempts, at the best of our knowledge, to deal with corpus-based semantic relation
identiﬁcation in a multiclass classiﬁcation task. Few exceptions include the works by Turney (2008)
on similarity, antonymy and analogy, and by Pantel and Pernacchiotti (2006) on Espresso, a weakly
supervised, pattern-based algorithm. Both these systems are based on patterns, which are known to be
more precise than DSMs, even though they suffer from lower recall (i.e. they in fact require words to co-
occur in the same sentence). DSMs, on the other hand, offer higher recall at the cost of lower precision:
while they are strong in identifying distributionally similar words (i.e. nearest neighbors), they do not
offer any principled way to discriminate between semantic relations (i.e. the nearest neighbors of a word
are not only its synonyms, but they also include antonyms, hypernyms, and so on).

The attempts to provide DSMs with the ability of automatically identifying semantic relations
include a large number of unsupervised methods (Weeds and Weir, 2003; Lenci and Benotto, 2012;
Santus et al., 2014), which are unfortunately far from achieving the perfect accuracy.
In or-
der to achieve higher performance, supervised methods have been recently adopted, also thanks
to their ease (Weeds et al., 2014; Roller et al., 2014; Kruszewski et al., 2015; Roller and Erk, 2016;
Santus et al., 2016a; Nguyen et al., 2016; Shwartz et al., 2016). Many of them rely on distributional
word vectors, either concatenated or combined through algebraic functions. Others use as features either
patterns or scores from the above-mentioned unsupervised methods. While these systems generally ob-
tain high performance in classiﬁcation tasks involving a single semantic relation, they have rarely been
used on multiclass relation classiﬁcation. On top of it, some scholars have questioned their ability to
really learn semantic relations (Levy et al., 2015), claiming that they rather learn some lexical properties
from the word vectors they are trained with. This was also conﬁrmed by an experiment carried out by
Santus et al. (2016a), showing that up to 100% synthetic switched pairs (i.e. banana-animal; elephant-
fruit) are misclassiﬁed as hypernyms if the system is not provided with some of these negative examples
during training.

Recently, count based vectors have been substituted by prediction-based ones, which seem to slightly
improve the performance in some tasks, such as similarity estimation (Baroni et al., 2014), even though
Levy et al. (2015) demonstrated that these improvements were most likely due to the optimization of
hyperparameters that were instead left unoptimized in count-based models (for an overview on word
embeddings, see Gladkova et al. (2016)). On top of it, when combined with supervised methods, the low
interpretability of their dimensions makes it even harder to understand what the classiﬁers actually learn
(Levy et al., 2015).

Finally, the recent attempt of Shwartz et al. (2016) of combining patterns and distributional informa-

tion achieved extremely promising results in hypernymy identiﬁcation.

3 System description

Our system, ROOT18, is a Random Forest classiﬁer (Breiman, 2001) and it is based on the 18 features
described in the following subsections. The system in its best setting makes use of the Gini impurity
index as the splitting criterion and has 10 as the maximum tree depth. The half of the total number of
features were considered for each split.

3.1 Data

Our data come from ukWaC (Baroni et al., 2009), a 2 billion tokens corpus of English built by crawling
the .uk Internet domain. For the extraction of our features, we generated several distributional spaces,
which differ according to the window size and to the statistical association measure that was used to
weight raw co-occurrences. Since we obtained the best performances with window size 2 and Positive
Pointwise Mutual Information (Church and Hanks, 1990), we report the results only for this setting.

3.2 Features

Frequency It is a basic property of words and it is a very discriminative information.

In this
type of task,
it proved to be competitive in identifying the directionality of pairs of hypernyms
(Weeds and Weir, 2003), since we expect hypernyms to have higher frequency than hyponyms. For each
pair, we computed three features: the frequency of each word (Freq1,2) and their difference (DiffFreq).

Co-occurrence We compute the co-occurrence frequency (Cooc) between the two terms in each
pair. This measure has been claimed to be particularly useful to spot antonyms (Murphy, 2003), since
they are expected to occur in the same sentence more often than chance (e.g. Are you friend or foe?).

Entropy In information theory, this score is related to the informativeness of a message: the lower
its entropy, the higher its informativeness (Shannon, 1948). Moreover, subordinate terms tend to have
higher amounts of informativeness than superordinate ones. We computed the entropy of each word in
the pair (Entr1,2), plus the difference between entropies (DiffEntr).

Cosine similarity

is a standard measure in DSMs to compute similarity between words
(Turney and Pantel, 2010). This measure is very useful to discriminate between related and unrelated
terms.

It

LinSimilarity LinSimilarity (Lin, 1998) is a different similarity measure, computed as the ratio of

shared context between u and v to the contexts of each word:

sim(~u, ~v) =

~u · ~v
k~uk · k~vk

Lin(~u, ~v) =

Pc∈~u T ~v[~u[c] + ~v[c]
Pc∈~u ~u[c] + Pc∈~v ~v[c]

Directional similarity measures We extracted several directional similarity measures that were pro-
posed to detect hypernyms, such as WeedsPrec, cosWeeds, ClarkeDe and invCL (for a review, see Lenci
and Benotto (2012)). They are all based on the Distributional Inclusion Hypotesis, according to which
if a word u is semantically narrower to v, then a signiﬁcant number of the salient features of u will be
included also in v.

APSyn This measure and the following APAnt do not rely on the full distribution of words, but on
the top N most related contexts of the words according to some statistical association measure. APSyn
(Santus et al., 2016b) computes a weighted intersection of the top N context of the target words:

AP Syn(w1, w2) =

X
f ∈N (F1) T N (F2)

1
(rank1(f ) + rank2(f ))/2

That is, for every feature f included in the intersection between the top N features of w1 and w2 (N (F1),
N (F2) respectively), the measure adds 1 divided by the average rank of the feature in the rankings of the
top N features of w1 and w2.

APAnt APAnt (Santus et al., 2014) is deﬁned as the inverse of APSyn. This unsupervised measure
tries to discriminate between synonyms and antonyms by relying on the hypothesis that words with
similar distribution (i.e. high vector cosine) that do not share their most relevant contexts (i.e. what
APSyn computes) are likely to be antonyms. For each pair, we computed APSyn and APAnt for the top
1000 and for the top 100 contexts.

Same POS We realized that many of the random pairs in the data included words with different parts
of speech. Therefore, we decided to add a boolean value to our set of features: 1 if the most frequent
POS of the words in the pair were the same, 0 otherwise.

3.3 Evaluation dataset

The task organizers provided a training and a test set extracted from EVALution 1.0, a resource
that was speciﬁcally designed for evaluating systems on the identiﬁcation of semantic relations
(Santus et al., 2015). EVALution 1.0 was derived from WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998) and ConceptNet
(Liu and Singh, 2004) and it consists of almost 7500 word pairs, instantiating several semantic relations.
The training and the test set included, respectively, 3054 and 4260 word pairs and they are lexical-split,
that is, the two sets do not share any pair. Since words were not tagged, we performed POS-tagging with
the TreeTagger (Schmid, 1995).

Table 1: Precision, Recall and F-measure scores for subtask 1 and 2. The numbers between parentheses
in the ROOT18 rows refer to the number of estimators used by the classiﬁer.

As it can be seen from table 1, ROOT18 has a solid performance on the subtask 1, and it is quite ac-
curate in separating related terms from unrelated ones. Generally speaking, we noticed that the classiﬁer
performs better when Gini impurity index is used as a splitting criterion instead of entropy. The model
with 1000 estimators is our best performing one, with Precision = 0.823, Recall = 0.657 and F-score
= 0.731. Concerning the contribution of the features, APSyn1000 and vector cosine have the highest
relative importance, with respective contributions of 0.29 and 0.12 to the prediction function. This is not
at all surprising, since APSyn and cosine already proved to be strong predictors of semantic similarity.

Table 3: Confusion matrix for subtask 2 (ROOT-18 with 500 estimators).

Results are much less convincing for subtask 2. In particular, the recall values are extremely low,
especially for some of the semantic relations: part of, for example, is often below 0.15. For such relation
we have no dedicated features in our system, so the difﬁculty in identifying meronyms are not a surprise.
On the other hand, ROOT18 showed the beneﬁts of the inclusion of several measures targeting hyper-
nymy, since the latter is the most accurately recognized relation (precision often > 0.4), recording also
the higher recall (always > 0.3, even in the worst performing models).

The performance did not show any particular improvement by increasing the number of the decision
trees, so that our best overall results are obtained by the model with 500 estimators (precision = 0.343,
recall = 0.218 and F-score = 0.261). As for the contributions of the single features, APSyn1000 (0.19)
and cosine (0.09) are still the top ones, followed by cosWeeds (0.07) and APAnt1000 (0.06).

Table 4 describes the confusion matrix, which shows that randoms are properly working as distractors
for the model, leading to a large number of misclassiﬁcation. Synonyms are often confused with hyper-
nyms and this might be due to the fact that the difference between the two is subtle. These results suggest
that measures based on the Distributional Inclusion Hypothesis are not always efﬁcient in discriminating
between synonyms and hypernyms.

Antonyms are confused with hypernyms and vice versa, which might be due to the fact that nei-
ther share their most relevant features, obtaining therefore similar APAnt scores (Santus et al., 2015b).
Meronyms, ﬁnally, are mostly confused with hypernyms, which is almost surely due to the generality
spread that characterize both relations and that is captured by both frequency and entropy in our system.

4.1 Conclusions

Our results clearly highlight the difﬁculty of DSMs in discriminating between several semantic relations
at once. Such models, in fact, rely on a vague deﬁnition of semantic similarity (i.e. distributional
similarity) which does not offer any principled way to distinguish among different types of semantic
relations.

Nonetheless, it is still feasible for traditional DSMs to achieve good performances on the recognition
of taxonomical relations (Santus et al., 2016a), for which metrics can be deﬁned on the basis of feature
inclusion, of context informativeness etc. For other relations, such as antonymy and meronymy, it is
not easy to deﬁne measures based on distributional similarity (for the latter relation, it is difﬁcult even to
ﬁnd an univocal deﬁnition: see Morlane-Hond`ere (2015)): APAnt works relatively well in discriminating
antonyms from synonyms, but – as noticed by Santus et al. (2015b) – this measure has also a bias towards
hypernyms, which explains why these are often confused. A possible solution, in our view, would be
the integration of DSMs with pattern-based information, in a way that is already being shown by some
of the current state-of-the-art systems (see, for example, Shwartz et al. (2016)). Such integration has the
advantage of combining the precision of the patterns with the high recall of DSMs.

Finally, we may assume that also the conﬁguration of the original dataset could contribute to our
results, since some pairs in the dataset have ambiguous words and the target relations hold for only one
of the their meanings. Disambiguating the pairs, at least by Part-Of-Speech, would certainly help in
improving the results. A simple method might consist in computing the vector cosine for the pairs with
the target words declined in all possible POS (i.e. VV, NN, JJ) and then maintain in the dataset only the
pair with the higher value.
