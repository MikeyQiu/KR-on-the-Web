ABSTRACT

Recent papers have shown that neural networks obtain state-of-the-art perfor-
mance on several different sequence tagging tasks. One appealing property of
such systems is their generality, as excellent performance can be achieved with a
uniﬁed architecture and without task-speciﬁc feature engineering. However, it is
unclear if such systems can be used for tasks without large amounts of training
data.
In this paper we explore the problem of transfer learning for neural se-
quence taggers, where a source task with plentiful annotations (e.g., POS tagging
on Penn Treebank) is used to improve performance on a target task with fewer
available annotations (e.g., POS tagging for microblogs). We examine the effects
of transfer learning for deep hierarchical recurrent networks across domains, ap-
plications, and languages, and show that signiﬁcant improvement can often be
obtained. These improvements lead to improvements over the current state-of-
the-art on several well-studied tasks.1

INTRODUCTION

Sequence tagging is an important problem in natural language processing, which has wide applica-
tions including part-of-speech (POS) tagging, text chunking, and named entity recognition (NER).
Given a sequence of words, sequence tagging aims to predict a linguistic tag for each word such as
the POS tag.

An important challenge for sequence tagging is how to transfer knowledge from one task to another,
which is often referred to as transfer learning (Pan & Yang, 2010). Transfer learning can be used in
several settings, notably for low-resource languages (Zirikly & Hagiwara, 2015; Wang & Manning,
2014) and low-resource domains such as biomedical corpora (Kim et al., 2003) and Twitter corpora
(Ritter et al., 2011)). In these cases, transfer learning can improve performance by taking advan-
tage of more plentiful labels from related tasks. Even on datasets with relatively abundant labels,
multi-task transfer can sometimes achieve improvement over state-of-the-art results (Collobert et al.,
2011).

Recently, a number of approaches based on deep neural networks have addressed the problem of
sequence tagging in an end-to-end manner (Collobert et al., 2011; Lample et al., 2016; Ling et al.,
2015; Ma & Hovy, 2016). These neural networks consist of multiple layers of neurons organized in
a hierarchy and can transform the input tokens to the output labels without explicit hand-engineered
feature extraction. The aforementioned neural networks require minimal assumptions about the task
at hand and thus demonstrate signiﬁcant generality—one single model can be applied to multiple
applications in multiple languages without changing the architecture. A natural question is whether
the representation learned from one task can be useful for another task. In other words, is there a
way we can exploit the generality of neural networks to improve task performance by sharing model
parameters and feature representations with another task?

To address the above question, we study the transfer learning setting, which aims to improve the
performance on a target task by joint training with a source task. We present a transfer learning ap-
proach based on a deep hierarchical recurrent neural network, which shares the hidden feature repre-

sentation and part of the model parameters between the source task and the target task. Our approach
combines the objectives of the two tasks and uses gradient-based methods for efﬁcient training. We
study cross-domain, cross-application, and cross-lingual transfer, and present a parameter-sharing
architecture for each case. Experimental results show that our approach can signiﬁcantly improve
the performance of the target task when the the target task has few labels and is more related to the
source task. Furthermore, we show that transfer learning can improve performance over state-of-
the-art results even if the amount of labels is relatively abundant.

We have novel contributions in two folds. First, our work is, to the best of our knowledge, the
ﬁrst that focuses on studying the transferability of different layers of representations for hierarchical
RNNs. Second, different from previous transfer learning methods that usually focus on one speciﬁc
transfer setting, our framework exploits different levels of representation sharing and provides a
uniﬁed framework to handle cross-application, cross-lingual, and cross-domain transfer.

2 RELATED WORK

There are two common paradigms for transfer learning for natural language processing (NLP) tasks,
resource-based transfer and model-based transfer. Resource-based transfer utilizes additional lin-
guistic annotations as weak supervision for transfer learning, such as cross-lingual dictionaries
(Zirikly & Hagiwara, 2015), corpora (Wang & Manning, 2014), and word alignments (Yarowsky
et al., 2001). Resource-based methods demonstrate considerable success in cross-lingual transfer,
but are quite sensitive to the scale and quality of the additional resources. Resource-based transfer
is mostly limited to cross-lingual transfer in previous works, and there is not extensive research on
extending resource-based methods to cross-domain and cross-application settings.

Model-based transfer, on the other hand, does not require additional resources. Model-based transfer
exploits the similarity and relatedness between the source task and the target task by adaptively mod-
ifying the model architectures, training algorithms, or feature representation. For example, Ando &
Zhang (2005) proposed a transfer learning framework that shares structural parameters across mul-
tiple tasks, and improve the performance on various tasks including NER; Collobert et al. (2011)
presented a task-independent convolutional neural network and employed joint training to transfer
knowledge from NER and POS tagging to chunking; Peng & Dredze (2016) studied transfer learning
between named entity recognition and word segmentation in Chinese based on recurrent neural net-
works. Cross-domain transfer, or domain adaptation, is also a well-studied branch of model-based
transfer in NLP. Techniques in cross-domain transfer include the design of robust feature repre-
sentations (Schnabel & Sch¨utze, 2014), co-training (Chen et al., 2011), hierarchical Bayesian prior
(Finkel & Manning, 2009), and canonical component analysis (Kim et al., 2015).

While our approach falls into the paradigm of model-based transfer, in contrast to the above methods,
our method focuses on exploiting the generality of deep recurrent neural networks and is applicable
to transfer between domains, applications, and languages.

Our work builds on previous work on sequence tagging based on deep neural networks. Collobert
et al. (2011) develop end-to-end neural networks for sequence tagging without hand-engineered fea-
tures. Later architectures based on different combinations of convolutional networks and recurrent
networks have achieved state-of-the-art results on many tasks (Collobert et al., 2011; Huang et al.,
2015; Chiu & Nichols, 2015; Lample et al., 2016; Ma & Hovy, 2016). These models demonstrate
signiﬁcant generality since they can be applied to multiple applications in multiple languages with
a uniﬁed network architecture and without task-speciﬁc feature extraction.

3 APPROACH

In this section, we introduce our transfer learning approach. We ﬁrst introduce an abstract framework
for neural sequence tagging, summarizing previous work, and then discuss three different transfer
learning architectures.

transfer with disparate label sets, and cross-
application transfer.

denotes word-level neural networks, “Char Emb” and “Word Emb” refer to character embeddings
and word embeddings respectively.

3.1 BASE MODEL

Though many different variants of neural networks have been proposed for the problem of sequence
tagging, we ﬁnd that most of the models can be described with the hierarchical framework illustrated
in Figure 1(a). A character-level layer takes a sequence of characters (represented as embeddings)
as input, and outputs a representation that encodes the morphological information at the character
level. A word-level layer subsequently combines the character-level feature representation and a
word embedding, and further incorporates the contextual information to output a new feature repre-
sentation. After two levels of feature extraction (encoding), the feature representation output by the
word-level layer is fed to a conditional random ﬁeld (CRF) layer that outputs the label sequence.

Both of the word-level layer and the character-level layer can be implemented as convolutional neu-
ral networks (CNNs) or recurrent neural networks (RNNs) (Collobert et al., 2011; Chiu & Nichols,
2015; Lample et al., 2016; Ma & Hovy, 2016). We discuss the details of the model we use in this
work in Section 3.4.

3.2 TRANSFER LEARNING ARCHITECTURES

We develop three architectures for transfer learning, T-A, T-B, and T-C, are illustrated in Figures
1(b), 1(c), and 1(d) respectively. The three architectures are all extensions of the base model dis-
cussed in the previous section with different parameter sharing schemes. We now discuss the use
cases for the different architectures.

3.2.1 CROSS-DOMAIN TRANSFER

Since different domains are “sub-languages” that have domain-speciﬁc regularities, sequence tag-
gers trained on one domain might not have optimal performance on another domain. The goal of
cross-domain transfer is to learn a sequence tagger that transfers knowledge from a source domain
to a target domain. We assume that few labels are available in the target domain.

There are two cases of cross-domain transfer. The two domains can have label sets that can be
mapped to each other, or disparate label sets. For example, POS tags in the Genia biomedical corpus
can be mapped to Penn Treebank tags (Barrett & Weber-Jahnke, 2014), while some POS tags in
Twitter (e.g., “URL”) cannot be mapped to Penn Treebank tags (Ritter et al., 2011).

If the two domains have mappable label sets, we share all the model parameters and feature repre-
sentation in the neural networks, including the word and character embedding, the word-level layer,
the character-level layer, and the CRF layer. We perform a label mapping step on top of the CRF
layer. This becomes the model T-A as shown in Figure 1(b).

If the two domains have disparate label sets, we untie the parameter sharing in the CRF layer—i.e.,
each task learns a separate CRF layer. This parameter sharing scheme reduces to model T-B as
shown in Figure 1(c).

3.2.2 CROSS-APPLICATION TRANSFER

Sequence tagging has a couple of applications including POS tagging, chunking, and named entity
recognition. Similar to the motivation in (Collobert et al., 2011), it is usually desirable to exploit
the underlying similarities and regularities of different applications, and improve the performance
of one application via joint training with another. Moreover, transfer between multiple applications
can be helpful when the labels are limited.

In the cross-application setting, we assume that multiple applications are in the same language.
Since different applications share the same alphabet, the case is similar to cross-domain transfer
with disparate label sets. We adopt the architecture of model T-B for cross-application transfer
learning where only the CRF layers are disjoint for different applications.

3.2.3 CROSS-LINGUAL TRANSFER

Though cross-lingual transfer is usually accomplished with additional multi-lingual resources, these
methods are sensitive to the size and quality of the additional resources (Yarowsky et al., 2001;
Wang & Manning, 2014). In this work, instead, we explore a complementary method that exploits
the cross-lingual regularities purely on the model level.

Our approach focuses on transfer learning between languages with similar alphabets, such as English
and Spanish, since it is very difﬁcult for transfer learning between languages with disparate alphabets
(e.g., English and Chinese) to work without additional resources (Zirikly & Hagiwara, 2015).

Model-level transfer learning is achieved through exploiting the morphologies shared by the two
languages. For example, “Canada” in English and “Canad´a” in Spanish refer to the same named
entity, and the morphological similarities can be leveraged for NER and also POS tagging with
nouns. Thus we share the character embeddings and the character-level layer between different
languages for transfer learning, which is illustrated as the model T-C in Figure 1(d).

3.3 TRAINING

In the above sections, we introduced three neural architectures with different parameter sharing
schemes, designed for different transfer learning settings. Now we describe how we train the neural
networks jointly for two tasks.

Suppose we are transferring from a source task s to a target task t, with the training instances being
Xs and Xt. Let Ws and Wt denote the set of model parameters for the source and target tasks
respectively. The model parameters are divided into two sets, task speciﬁc parameters and shared
parameters, i.e.,

Ws = Ws,spec ∪ Wshared, Wt = Wt,spec ∪ Wshared,

4

Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2017

where shared parameters Wshared are jointly optimized by the two tasks, while task speciﬁc param-
eters Ws,spec and Wt,spec are trained for each task separately.
The training procedure is as follows. At each iteration, we sample a task (i.e., either s or t) from
{s, t} based on a binomial distribution (the binomial probability is set as a hyperparameter). Given
the sampled task, we sample a batch of training instances from the given task, and then perform
a gradient update according to the loss function of the given task. We update both the shared pa-
rameters and the task speciﬁc parameters. We repeat the above iterations until stopping. We adopt
AdaGrad (Duchi et al., 2011) to dynamically compute the learning rates for each iteration. Since the
source and target tasks might have different convergence rates, we do early stopping on the target
task performance.

3.4 MODEL IMPLEMENTATION

In this section, we describe our implementation of the base model. Both the character-level and
word-level neural networks are implemented as RNNs. More speciﬁcally, we employ gated re-
current units (GRUs) (Cho et al., 2014). Let (x1, x2, · · · , xT ) be a sequence of inputs that can be
embeddings or hidden states of other layers. Let ht be the GRU hidden state at time step t. Formally,
a GRU unit at time step t can be expressed as

rt = σ(Wrxxt + Wrhht−1)
zt = σ(Wzxxt + Wzhht−1)
˜ht = tanh(Whxxt + Whh(rt (cid:12) ht−1))
ht = zt (cid:12) ht−1 + (1 − zt) (cid:12) ˜ht,

where W ’s are model parameters of each unit, ˜ht is a candidate hidden state that is used to compute
ht, σ is an element-wise sigmoid logistic function deﬁned as σ(x) = 1/(1 + e−x), and (cid:12) denotes
element-wise multiplication of two vectors. Intuitively, the update gate zt controls how much the
unit updates its hidden state, and the reset gate rt determines how much information from the previ-
ous hidden state needs to be reset. The input to the character-level GRUs is character embeddings,
while the input to the word-level GRUs is the concatenation of character-level GRU hidden states
and word embeddings. Both GRUs are bi-directional and have two layers.

Given an input sequence of words, the word-level GRUs and the character-level GRUs together
learn a feature representation ht for the t-th word in the sequence, which forms a sequence
h = (h1, h2, · · · , hT ). Let y = (y1, y2, · · · , yT ) denote the tag sequence. Given the feature repre-
sentation h and the tag sequence y for each training instance, the CRF layer deﬁnes the objective
function to maximize based on a max-margin principle (Gimpel & Smith, 2010) as:
(cid:88)

f (h, y) − log

exp(f (h, y(cid:48)) + cost(y, y(cid:48))),

y(cid:48)∈Y(h)

where f is a function that assigns a score for each pair of h and y, and Y(h) denotes the space of tag
sequences for h. The cost function cost(y, y(cid:48)) is added based on the max-margin principle (Gimpel
& Smith, 2010) that high-cost tags y(cid:48) should be penalized more heavily.

Our base model is similar to Lample et al. (2016), but in contrast to their model, we employ GRUs
for the character-level and word-level networks instead of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) units,
and deﬁne the objective function based on the max-margin principle. We note that our transfer
learning framework does not make assumptions about speciﬁc model implementation, and could be
applied to other neural architectures (Collobert et al., 2011; Chiu & Nichols, 2015; Lample et al.,
2016; Ma & Hovy, 2016) as well.

The statistics of the datasets are described in Table 1. We construct the POS tagging dataset with
the instructions described in Toutanova et al. (2003). Note that as a standard practice, the POS tags
are extracted from the parsed trees. For the CoNLL 2003 English NER dataset, we follow previous
works (Collobert et al., 2011) to append one-hot gazetteer features to the input of the CRF layer
for fair comparison. Since there is no standard training/dev/test data split for the Genia and Twitter
corpora, we randomly sample 10% for test, 10% for development, and 80% for training. We follow
previous work (Barrett & Weber-Jahnke, 2014) to map Genia POS tags to PTB POS tags.

4.2 TRANSFER LEARNING PERFORMANCE

We evaluate our transfer learning approach on the above datasets. We ﬁx the hyperparameters for
all the results reported in this section: we set the character embedding dimension at 25, the word
embedding dimension at 50 for English and 64 for Spanish, the dimension of hidden states of the
character-level GRUs at 80, the dimension of hidden states of the word-level GRUs at 300, and
the initial learning rate at 0.01. Except for the Twitter datasets, these datasets are fairly large. To
simulate a low-resource setting, we also use random subsets of the data. We vary the labeling rate
of the target task at 0.001, 0.01, 0.1 and 1.0. Given a labeling rate r, we randomly sample a ratio r
of the sentences from the training set and discard the rest of the training data—e.g., a labeling rate
of 0.001 results in around 900 training tokens on PTB POS tagging (Cf. Table 1).

The results on transfer learning are plotted in Figure 2, where we compare the results with and
without transfer learning under various labeling rates. The numbers in the y-axes are accuracies for
POS tagging, and chunk-level F1 scores for chunking and NER. The numbers are shown in Table 2.
We can see that our transfer learning approach consistently improved over the non-transfer results.
We also observe that the improvement by transfer learning is more substantial when the labeling
rate is lower. For cross-domain transfer, we obtained substantial improvement on the Genia and
Twitter corpora by transferring the knowledge from PTB POS tagging and CoNLL 2003 NER. For
example, as shown in Figure 2(a), we can obtain an tagging accuracy of 83%+ with zero labels
and 92% with only 0.001 labels when transferring from PTB to Genia. As shown in Figures 2(d)
and 2(e), our transfer learning approach can improve the performance on Twitter POS tagging and
NER for all labeling rates, and the improvements with 0.1 labels are more than 8% for both datasets.
Cross-application transfer also leads to substantial improvement under low-resource conditions. For

example, as shown in Figures 2(g) and 2(h), the improvements with 0.1 labels are 6% and 3%
on CoNLL 2000 chunking and CoNLL 2003 NER respectively when transferring from PTB POS
tagging. Figures 2(j) and 2(i) show that cross-lingual transfer can improve the performance when
few labels are available.

Figure 2 further shows that the improvements by different architectures are in the following order:
T-A > T-B > T-C. This phenomenon can be explained by the fact that T-A shares the most model
parameters while T-C shares the least. Transfer settings like cross-lingual transfer can only use T-C
because the underlying similarities between the source task and the target task are less prominent
(i.e., less transferable), and in those cases the improvement by transfer learning is less substantial.

Another interesting comparison is among Figures 2(a), 2(b), and 2(c). Figure 2(a) is cross-domain
transfer, Figure 2(b) is transfer across domains and applications at the same time, and Figure 2(c)
combines all the three transfer settings (i.e., from Spanish NER in the general domain to English
POS tagging in the biomedical domain). The results show that the improvement by transfer learning
diminishes when the transfer becomes “indirect” (i.e., the source task and the target task are more
loosely related).

We also study using different transfer learning models for the same task. We study the effects of
using T-A, T-B, and T-C when transferring from PTB to Genia, and the results are included in the
lower part of Table 2. We observe that the performance gain decreases when less parameters are
shared (i.e., T-A > T-B > T-C).

4.3 COMPARISON WITH STATE-OF-THE-ART RESULTS

In the above section, we examine the effects of different transfer learning architectures. Now we
compare our approach with state-of-the-art systems on these datasets.

We use publicly available pretrained word embeddings as initialization. On the English datasets, fol-
lowing previous works that are based on neural networks (Collobert et al., 2011; Huang et al., 2015;
Chiu & Nichols, 2015; Ma & Hovy, 2016), we experiment with both the 50-dimensional SENNA
embeddings (Collobert et al., 2011) and the 100-dimensional GloVe embeddings (Pennington et al.,
2014) and use the development set to choose the embeddings for different tasks and settings. For
Spanish and Dutch, we use the 64-dimensional Polyglot embeddings (Al-Rfou et al., 2013). We set
the hidden state dimensions to be 300 for the word-level GRU. The initial learning rate for AdaGrad
is ﬁxed at 0.01. We use the development set to tune the other hyperparameters of our model.

Our results are reported in Table 3. Since there are no standard data splits on the Genia and Twit-
ter corpora, we do not include these datasets into our comparison. The results for CoNLL 2000
chunking, CoNLL 2003 NER, and PTB POS tagging are obtained by transfer learning between the
three tasks, i.e., transferring from two tasks to the other. The results for Spanish and Dutch NER
are obtained with transfer learning between the NER datasets in three languages (English, Spanish,
and Dutch). From Table 3, we can draw two conclusions. First, our transfer learning approach
achieves new state-of-the-art results on all the considered benchmark datasets except PTB POS tag-
ging, which indicates that transfer learning can still improve the performance even on datasets with

8

Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2017

relatively abundant labels. Second, our base model (w/o transfer) performs competitively compared
to the state-of-the-art systems, which means that the improvements shown in Section 4.2 are ob-
tained over a strong baseline.

5 CONCLUSION

In this paper we develop a transfer learning approach for sequence tagging, which exploits the gen-
erality demonstrated by deep neural networks in previous work. We design three neural network
architectures for the settings of cross-domain, cross-application, and cross-lingual transfer. Our
transfer learning approach achieves signiﬁcant improvement on various datasets under low-resource
conditions, as well as new state-of-the-art results on some of the benchmarks. With thorough exper-
iments, we observe that the following factors are crucial for the performance of our transfer learning
approach: a) label abundance for the target task, b) relatedness between the source and target tasks,
and c) the number of parameters that can be shared. In the future, it will be interesting to com-
bine model-based transfer (as in this work) with resource-based transfer for cross-lingual transfer
learning.

HIERARCHICAL RECURRENT NETWORKS

ABSTRACT

Recent papers have shown that neural networks obtain state-of-the-art perfor-
mance on several different sequence tagging tasks. One appealing property of
such systems is their generality, as excellent performance can be achieved with a
uniﬁed architecture and without task-speciﬁc feature engineering. However, it is
unclear if such systems can be used for tasks without large amounts of training
data.
In this paper we explore the problem of transfer learning for neural se-
quence taggers, where a source task with plentiful annotations (e.g., POS tagging
on Penn Treebank) is used to improve performance on a target task with fewer
available annotations (e.g., POS tagging for microblogs). We examine the effects
of transfer learning for deep hierarchical recurrent networks across domains, ap-
plications, and languages, and show that signiﬁcant improvement can often be
obtained. These improvements lead to improvements over the current state-of-
the-art on several well-studied tasks.1

INTRODUCTION

Sequence tagging is an important problem in natural language processing, which has wide applica-
tions including part-of-speech (POS) tagging, text chunking, and named entity recognition (NER).
Given a sequence of words, sequence tagging aims to predict a linguistic tag for each word such as
the POS tag.

An important challenge for sequence tagging is how to transfer knowledge from one task to another,
which is often referred to as transfer learning (Pan & Yang, 2010). Transfer learning can be used in
several settings, notably for low-resource languages (Zirikly & Hagiwara, 2015; Wang & Manning,
2014) and low-resource domains such as biomedical corpora (Kim et al., 2003) and Twitter corpora
(Ritter et al., 2011)). In these cases, transfer learning can improve performance by taking advan-
tage of more plentiful labels from related tasks. Even on datasets with relatively abundant labels,
multi-task transfer can sometimes achieve improvement over state-of-the-art results (Collobert et al.,
2011).

Recently, a number of approaches based on deep neural networks have addressed the problem of
sequence tagging in an end-to-end manner (Collobert et al., 2011; Lample et al., 2016; Ling et al.,
2015; Ma & Hovy, 2016). These neural networks consist of multiple layers of neurons organized in
a hierarchy and can transform the input tokens to the output labels without explicit hand-engineered
feature extraction. The aforementioned neural networks require minimal assumptions about the task
at hand and thus demonstrate signiﬁcant generality—one single model can be applied to multiple
applications in multiple languages without changing the architecture. A natural question is whether
the representation learned from one task can be useful for another task. In other words, is there a
way we can exploit the generality of neural networks to improve task performance by sharing model
parameters and feature representations with another task?

To address the above question, we study the transfer learning setting, which aims to improve the
performance on a target task by joint training with a source task. We present a transfer learning ap-
proach based on a deep hierarchical recurrent neural network, which shares the hidden feature repre-

sentation and part of the model parameters between the source task and the target task. Our approach
combines the objectives of the two tasks and uses gradient-based methods for efﬁcient training. We
study cross-domain, cross-application, and cross-lingual transfer, and present a parameter-sharing
architecture for each case. Experimental results show that our approach can signiﬁcantly improve
the performance of the target task when the the target task has few labels and is more related to the
source task. Furthermore, we show that transfer learning can improve performance over state-of-
the-art results even if the amount of labels is relatively abundant.

We have novel contributions in two folds. First, our work is, to the best of our knowledge, the
ﬁrst that focuses on studying the transferability of different layers of representations for hierarchical
RNNs. Second, different from previous transfer learning methods that usually focus on one speciﬁc
transfer setting, our framework exploits different levels of representation sharing and provides a
uniﬁed framework to handle cross-application, cross-lingual, and cross-domain transfer.

2 RELATED WORK

There are two common paradigms for transfer learning for natural language processing (NLP) tasks,
resource-based transfer and model-based transfer. Resource-based transfer utilizes additional lin-
guistic annotations as weak supervision for transfer learning, such as cross-lingual dictionaries
(Zirikly & Hagiwara, 2015), corpora (Wang & Manning, 2014), and word alignments (Yarowsky
et al., 2001). Resource-based methods demonstrate considerable success in cross-lingual transfer,
but are quite sensitive to the scale and quality of the additional resources. Resource-based transfer
is mostly limited to cross-lingual transfer in previous works, and there is not extensive research on
extending resource-based methods to cross-domain and cross-application settings.

Model-based transfer, on the other hand, does not require additional resources. Model-based transfer
exploits the similarity and relatedness between the source task and the target task by adaptively mod-
ifying the model architectures, training algorithms, or feature representation. For example, Ando &
Zhang (2005) proposed a transfer learning framework that shares structural parameters across mul-
tiple tasks, and improve the performance on various tasks including NER; Collobert et al. (2011)
presented a task-independent convolutional neural network and employed joint training to transfer
knowledge from NER and POS tagging to chunking; Peng & Dredze (2016) studied transfer learning
between named entity recognition and word segmentation in Chinese based on recurrent neural net-
works. Cross-domain transfer, or domain adaptation, is also a well-studied branch of model-based
transfer in NLP. Techniques in cross-domain transfer include the design of robust feature repre-
sentations (Schnabel & Sch¨utze, 2014), co-training (Chen et al., 2011), hierarchical Bayesian prior
(Finkel & Manning, 2009), and canonical component analysis (Kim et al., 2015).

While our approach falls into the paradigm of model-based transfer, in contrast to the above methods,
our method focuses on exploiting the generality of deep recurrent neural networks and is applicable
to transfer between domains, applications, and languages.

Our work builds on previous work on sequence tagging based on deep neural networks. Collobert
et al. (2011) develop end-to-end neural networks for sequence tagging without hand-engineered fea-
tures. Later architectures based on different combinations of convolutional networks and recurrent
networks have achieved state-of-the-art results on many tasks (Collobert et al., 2011; Huang et al.,
2015; Chiu & Nichols, 2015; Lample et al., 2016; Ma & Hovy, 2016). These models demonstrate
signiﬁcant generality since they can be applied to multiple applications in multiple languages with
a uniﬁed network architecture and without task-speciﬁc feature extraction.

3 APPROACH

In this section, we introduce our transfer learning approach. We ﬁrst introduce an abstract framework
for neural sequence tagging, summarizing previous work, and then discuss three different transfer
learning architectures.

and word embeddings respectively.

3.1 BASE MODEL

Though many different variants of neural networks have been proposed for the problem of sequence
tagging, we ﬁnd that most of the models can be described with the hierarchical framework illustrated
in Figure 1(a). A character-level layer takes a sequence of characters (represented as embeddings)
as input, and outputs a representation that encodes the morphological information at the character
level. A word-level layer subsequently combines the character-level feature representation and a
word embedding, and further incorporates the contextual information to output a new feature repre-
sentation. After two levels of feature extraction (encoding), the feature representation output by the
word-level layer is fed to a conditional random ﬁeld (CRF) layer that outputs the label sequence.

Both of the word-level layer and the character-level layer can be implemented as convolutional neu-
ral networks (CNNs) or recurrent neural networks (RNNs) (Collobert et al., 2011; Chiu & Nichols,
2015; Lample et al., 2016; Ma & Hovy, 2016). We discuss the details of the model we use in this
work in Section 3.4.

3.2 TRANSFER LEARNING ARCHITECTURES

We develop three architectures for transfer learning, T-A, T-B, and T-C, are illustrated in Figures
1(b), 1(c), and 1(d) respectively. The three architectures are all extensions of the base model dis-
cussed in the previous section with different parameter sharing schemes. We now discuss the use
cases for the different architectures.

3.2.1 CROSS-DOMAIN TRANSFER

Since different domains are “sub-languages” that have domain-speciﬁc regularities, sequence tag-
gers trained on one domain might not have optimal performance on another domain. The goal of
cross-domain transfer is to learn a sequence tagger that transfers knowledge from a source domain
to a target domain. We assume that few labels are available in the target domain.

There are two cases of cross-domain transfer. The two domains can have label sets that can be
mapped to each other, or disparate label sets. For example, POS tags in the Genia biomedical corpus
can be mapped to Penn Treebank tags (Barrett & Weber-Jahnke, 2014), while some POS tags in
Twitter (e.g., “URL”) cannot be mapped to Penn Treebank tags (Ritter et al., 2011).

If the two domains have mappable label sets, we share all the model parameters and feature repre-
sentation in the neural networks, including the word and character embedding, the word-level layer,
the character-level layer, and the CRF layer. We perform a label mapping step on top of the CRF
layer. This becomes the model T-A as shown in Figure 1(b).

If the two domains have disparate label sets, we untie the parameter sharing in the CRF layer—i.e.,
each task learns a separate CRF layer. This parameter sharing scheme reduces to model T-B as
shown in Figure 1(c).

3.2.2 CROSS-APPLICATION TRANSFER

Sequence tagging has a couple of applications including POS tagging, chunking, and named entity
recognition. Similar to the motivation in (Collobert et al., 2011), it is usually desirable to exploit
the underlying similarities and regularities of different applications, and improve the performance
of one application via joint training with another. Moreover, transfer between multiple applications
can be helpful when the labels are limited.

In the cross-application setting, we assume that multiple applications are in the same language.
Since different applications share the same alphabet, the case is similar to cross-domain transfer
with disparate label sets. We adopt the architecture of model T-B for cross-application transfer
learning where only the CRF layers are disjoint for different applications.

3.2.3 CROSS-LINGUAL TRANSFER

Though cross-lingual transfer is usually accomplished with additional multi-lingual resources, these
methods are sensitive to the size and quality of the additional resources (Yarowsky et al., 2001;
Wang & Manning, 2014). In this work, instead, we explore a complementary method that exploits
the cross-lingual regularities purely on the model level.

Our approach focuses on transfer learning between languages with similar alphabets, such as English
and Spanish, since it is very difﬁcult for transfer learning between languages with disparate alphabets
(e.g., English and Chinese) to work without additional resources (Zirikly & Hagiwara, 2015).

Model-level transfer learning is achieved through exploiting the morphologies shared by the two
languages. For example, “Canada” in English and “Canad´a” in Spanish refer to the same named
entity, and the morphological similarities can be leveraged for NER and also POS tagging with
nouns. Thus we share the character embeddings and the character-level layer between different
languages for transfer learning, which is illustrated as the model T-C in Figure 1(d).

3.3 TRAINING

In the above sections, we introduced three neural architectures with different parameter sharing
schemes, designed for different transfer learning settings. Now we describe how we train the neural
networks jointly for two tasks.

Suppose we are transferring from a source task s to a target task t, with the training instances being
Xs and Xt. Let Ws and Wt denote the set of model parameters for the source and target tasks
respectively. The model parameters are divided into two sets, task speciﬁc parameters and shared
parameters, i.e.,

Ws = Ws,spec ∪ Wshared, Wt = Wt,spec ∪ Wshared,

4

Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2017

where shared parameters Wshared are jointly optimized by the two tasks, while task speciﬁc param-
eters Ws,spec and Wt,spec are trained for each task separately.
The training procedure is as follows. At each iteration, we sample a task (i.e., either s or t) from
{s, t} based on a binomial distribution (the binomial probability is set as a hyperparameter). Given
the sampled task, we sample a batch of training instances from the given task, and then perform
a gradient update according to the loss function of the given task. We update both the shared pa-
rameters and the task speciﬁc parameters. We repeat the above iterations until stopping. We adopt
AdaGrad (Duchi et al., 2011) to dynamically compute the learning rates for each iteration. Since the
source and target tasks might have different convergence rates, we do early stopping on the target
task performance.

3.4 MODEL IMPLEMENTATION

In this section, we describe our implementation of the base model. Both the character-level and
word-level neural networks are implemented as RNNs. More speciﬁcally, we employ gated re-
current units (GRUs) (Cho et al., 2014). Let (x1, x2, · · · , xT ) be a sequence of inputs that can be
embeddings or hidden states of other layers. Let ht be the GRU hidden state at time step t. Formally,
a GRU unit at time step t can be expressed as

rt = σ(Wrxxt + Wrhht−1)
zt = σ(Wzxxt + Wzhht−1)
˜ht = tanh(Whxxt + Whh(rt (cid:12) ht−1))
ht = zt (cid:12) ht−1 + (1 − zt) (cid:12) ˜ht,

where W ’s are model parameters of each unit, ˜ht is a candidate hidden state that is used to compute
ht, σ is an element-wise sigmoid logistic function deﬁned as σ(x) = 1/(1 + e−x), and (cid:12) denotes
element-wise multiplication of two vectors. Intuitively, the update gate zt controls how much the
unit updates its hidden state, and the reset gate rt determines how much information from the previ-
ous hidden state needs to be reset. The input to the character-level GRUs is character embeddings,
while the input to the word-level GRUs is the concatenation of character-level GRU hidden states
and word embeddings. Both GRUs are bi-directional and have two layers.

Given an input sequence of words, the word-level GRUs and the character-level GRUs together
learn a feature representation ht for the t-th word in the sequence, which forms a sequence
h = (h1, h2, · · · , hT ). Let y = (y1, y2, · · · , yT ) denote the tag sequence. Given the feature repre-
sentation h and the tag sequence y for each training instance, the CRF layer deﬁnes the objective
function to maximize based on a max-margin principle (Gimpel & Smith, 2010) as:
(cid:88)

f (h, y) − log

exp(f (h, y(cid:48)) + cost(y, y(cid:48))),

y(cid:48)∈Y(h)

where f is a function that assigns a score for each pair of h and y, and Y(h) denotes the space of tag
sequences for h. The cost function cost(y, y(cid:48)) is added based on the max-margin principle (Gimpel
& Smith, 2010) that high-cost tags y(cid:48) should be penalized more heavily.

Our base model is similar to Lample et al. (2016), but in contrast to their model, we employ GRUs
for the character-level and word-level networks instead of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) units,
and deﬁne the objective function based on the max-margin principle. We note that our transfer
learning framework does not make assumptions about speciﬁc model implementation, and could be
applied to other neural architectures (Collobert et al., 2011; Chiu & Nichols, 2015; Lample et al.,
2016; Ma & Hovy, 2016) as well.

The statistics of the datasets are described in Table 1. We construct the POS tagging dataset with
the instructions described in Toutanova et al. (2003). Note that as a standard practice, the POS tags
are extracted from the parsed trees. For the CoNLL 2003 English NER dataset, we follow previous
works (Collobert et al., 2011) to append one-hot gazetteer features to the input of the CRF layer
for fair comparison. Since there is no standard training/dev/test data split for the Genia and Twitter
corpora, we randomly sample 10% for test, 10% for development, and 80% for training. We follow
previous work (Barrett & Weber-Jahnke, 2014) to map Genia POS tags to PTB POS tags.

4.2 TRANSFER LEARNING PERFORMANCE

We evaluate our transfer learning approach on the above datasets. We ﬁx the hyperparameters for
all the results reported in this section: we set the character embedding dimension at 25, the word
embedding dimension at 50 for English and 64 for Spanish, the dimension of hidden states of the
character-level GRUs at 80, the dimension of hidden states of the word-level GRUs at 300, and
the initial learning rate at 0.01. Except for the Twitter datasets, these datasets are fairly large. To
simulate a low-resource setting, we also use random subsets of the data. We vary the labeling rate
of the target task at 0.001, 0.01, 0.1 and 1.0. Given a labeling rate r, we randomly sample a ratio r
of the sentences from the training set and discard the rest of the training data—e.g., a labeling rate
of 0.001 results in around 900 training tokens on PTB POS tagging (Cf. Table 1).

The results on transfer learning are plotted in Figure 2, where we compare the results with and
without transfer learning under various labeling rates. The numbers in the y-axes are accuracies for
POS tagging, and chunk-level F1 scores for chunking and NER. The numbers are shown in Table 2.
We can see that our transfer learning approach consistently improved over the non-transfer results.
We also observe that the improvement by transfer learning is more substantial when the labeling
rate is lower. For cross-domain transfer, we obtained substantial improvement on the Genia and
Twitter corpora by transferring the knowledge from PTB POS tagging and CoNLL 2003 NER. For
example, as shown in Figure 2(a), we can obtain an tagging accuracy of 83%+ with zero labels
and 92% with only 0.001 labels when transferring from PTB to Genia. As shown in Figures 2(d)
and 2(e), our transfer learning approach can improve the performance on Twitter POS tagging and
NER for all labeling rates, and the improvements with 0.1 labels are more than 8% for both datasets.
Cross-application transfer also leads to substantial improvement under low-resource conditions. For

example, as shown in Figures 2(g) and 2(h), the improvements with 0.1 labels are 6% and 3%
on CoNLL 2000 chunking and CoNLL 2003 NER respectively when transferring from PTB POS
tagging. Figures 2(j) and 2(i) show that cross-lingual transfer can improve the performance when
few labels are available.

Figure 2 further shows that the improvements by different architectures are in the following order:
T-A > T-B > T-C. This phenomenon can be explained by the fact that T-A shares the most model
parameters while T-C shares the least. Transfer settings like cross-lingual transfer can only use T-C
because the underlying similarities between the source task and the target task are less prominent
(i.e., less transferable), and in those cases the improvement by transfer learning is less substantial.

Another interesting comparison is among Figures 2(a), 2(b), and 2(c). Figure 2(a) is cross-domain
transfer, Figure 2(b) is transfer across domains and applications at the same time, and Figure 2(c)
combines all the three transfer settings (i.e., from Spanish NER in the general domain to English
POS tagging in the biomedical domain). The results show that the improvement by transfer learning
diminishes when the transfer becomes “indirect” (i.e., the source task and the target task are more
loosely related).

We also study using different transfer learning models for the same task. We study the effects of
using T-A, T-B, and T-C when transferring from PTB to Genia, and the results are included in the
lower part of Table 2. We observe that the performance gain decreases when less parameters are
shared (i.e., T-A > T-B > T-C).

4.3 COMPARISON WITH STATE-OF-THE-ART RESULTS

In the above section, we examine the effects of different transfer learning architectures. Now we
compare our approach with state-of-the-art systems on these datasets.

We use publicly available pretrained word embeddings as initialization. On the English datasets, fol-
lowing previous works that are based on neural networks (Collobert et al., 2011; Huang et al., 2015;
Chiu & Nichols, 2015; Ma & Hovy, 2016), we experiment with both the 50-dimensional SENNA
embeddings (Collobert et al., 2011) and the 100-dimensional GloVe embeddings (Pennington et al.,
2014) and use the development set to choose the embeddings for different tasks and settings. For
Spanish and Dutch, we use the 64-dimensional Polyglot embeddings (Al-Rfou et al., 2013). We set
the hidden state dimensions to be 300 for the word-level GRU. The initial learning rate for AdaGrad
is ﬁxed at 0.01. We use the development set to tune the other hyperparameters of our model.

Our results are reported in Table 3. Since there are no standard data splits on the Genia and Twit-
ter corpora, we do not include these datasets into our comparison. The results for CoNLL 2000
chunking, CoNLL 2003 NER, and PTB POS tagging are obtained by transfer learning between the
three tasks, i.e., transferring from two tasks to the other. The results for Spanish and Dutch NER
are obtained with transfer learning between the NER datasets in three languages (English, Spanish,
and Dutch). From Table 3, we can draw two conclusions. First, our transfer learning approach
achieves new state-of-the-art results on all the considered benchmark datasets except PTB POS tag-
ging, which indicates that transfer learning can still improve the performance even on datasets with

relatively abundant labels. Second, our base model (w/o transfer) performs competitively compared
to the state-of-the-art systems, which means that the improvements shown in Section 4.2 are ob-
tained over a strong baseline.

5 CONCLUSION

In this paper we develop a transfer learning approach for sequence tagging, which exploits the gen-
erality demonstrated by deep neural networks in previous work. We design three neural network
architectures for the settings of cross-domain, cross-application, and cross-lingual transfer. Our
transfer learning approach achieves signiﬁcant improvement on various datasets under low-resource
conditions, as well as new state-of-the-art results on some of the benchmarks. With thorough exper-
iments, we observe that the following factors are crucial for the performance of our transfer learning
approach: a) label abundance for the target task, b) relatedness between the source and target tasks,
and c) the number of parameters that can be shared. In the future, it will be interesting to com-
bine model-based transfer (as in this work) with resource-based transfer for cross-lingual transfer
learning.
