Abstract

The rise of social media and online social networks has been a disruptive force in society.
Opinions are increasingly shaped by interactions on online social media, and social phenomena
including disagreement and polarization are now tightly woven into everyday life. In this work
we initiate the study of the following question:

Given n agents, each with its own initial opinion that reﬂects its core value on a
topic, and an opinion dynamics model, what is the structure of a social network that
minimizes polarization and disagreement simultaneously?

This question is central to recommender systems: should a recommender system prefer a link
suggestion between two online users with similar mindsets in order to keep disagreement low,
or between two users with diﬀerent opinions in order to expose each to the other’s viewpoint of
the world, and decrease overall levels of polarization? Such decisions have an important global
eﬀect on society [51]. Our contributions include a mathematical formalization of this question
as an optimization problem and an exact, time-eﬃcient algorithm. We also prove that there
always exists a network with O(n/(cid:15)2) edges that is a (1 + (cid:15)) approximation to the optimum.
Our formulation is an instance of optimization over graph topologies, also considered e.g., in
[7, 12, 48]. For a ﬁxed graph, we additionally show how to optimize our objective function over
the agents’ innate opinions in polynomial time.

We perform an empirical study of our proposed methods on synthetic and real-world data
that verify their value as mining tools to better understand the trade-oﬀ between of disagreement
and polarization. We ﬁnd that there is a lot of space to reduce both polarization and disagree-
ment in real-world networks; for instance, on a Reddit network where users exchange comments
on politics, our methods achieve a ∼ 60 000-fold reduction in polarization and disagreement.

Introduction

The enormous popularity of social media and online social networks has led to fundamental changes
in how humans share and form opinions. Several events have stirred ﬁerce debates online, such
as the internal memo of James Damore at Google that leaked online and showed how society and
users of social media become strongly polarized around controversial issues [13]. Social phenomena
such as disagreement and polarization that have existed in human societies for millenia, are now
taking place in an online virtual world, with a huge impact on society. Furthermore, opinions
are increasingly shaped by social media. For this reason Facebook’s recommender systems were
recently accused of inﬂuencing voters by propagating fake news and Russian ads during the U.S.
national elections [49], thus stirring additional controversy about the role of tech giants in society.
Google has faced similar accusations about inﬂuencing the outcome of elections [44].

From a business perspective, recommender systems aim to maximize revenue – some in the short-
term, others in the long-term – by optimizing mathematical objectives related to click-through rate
and user engagement. However, given the increasing power of tech-giants like Facebook and Google,
a better understanding of the eﬀect of recommended links on society is required [50].

The following facts motivate our work. Valdis Krebs analyzed purchasing trends on Amazon.
He found that during the 2008 presidential elections, people who already supported Barack Obama
tended to be the same people buying books that painted him in a positive light. Similarly, people
who disliked him, bought books that painted him in a negative light [30, Chapter 1]. This bias
is known as conﬁrmation bias [31], and lies at the root of the spread of conspiracy theories and
fake news. Put simply, most humans avoid challenging their opinions. Therefore, a recommender
system trained on real-data, whose goal is to maximize revenue and increase user engagement,
may naturally end up creating “echo-chambers”. Equivalently, the recommended links minimize
the disagreement that the user experiences. In the context of social networks, connections between
users with similar mindsets are preferred over connections between users with diﬀerent mindsets.
On the other hand, minimizing disagreement leads to greater polarization. To see intuitively
why this is the case, consider a topic with two prevalent opinions such as supporting either Demo-
crat or Republican politics. As users connect to users with similar mindsets, two clusters with
strong and extreme opinions are formed, leading to greater polarization between the two groups
[6]. This polarization has harmful eﬀects on society; for example, reaching political consensus be-
comes much harder. This trade-oﬀ between disagreement and polarization motivates our work. We
are interested in understanding the structure of a social network that minimizes both disagree-
ment and polarization. We introduce and study two key problems, summarized below. For both
problems, we use as our underlying opinion dynamics model the Friedkin-Johnsen model [22] that
includes both disagreement and consensus, as it associates each node with an innate opinion and
an expressed opinion. For details see Section 2.

• Minimizing Polarization and Disagreement Over Graphs. We initiate the study of the
following important question in understanding the global eﬀect of recommended connections in
social networks on society. We formalize this problem mathematically, and provide a polynomial
time algorithm by proving that our optimization formulation is convex. Our formulation is an
instance of optimization over graph topologies. For other such optimization problems, see [7, 12, 48].

Problem 1 Given n agents, each with its own initial opinion that reﬂects its core value on
a topic, and an opinion dynamics model, what is the structure of a connected social network
with a given total edge weight that minimizes polarization and disagreement simultaneously?

We additionally prove that there always exists a graph with at most O(n/(cid:15)2) edges that achieves
a (1 + (cid:15))-approximation to the above problem. That is, disagreement and polarization can be
minimized by very sparsely connected networks.

• Minimizing Polarization and Disagreement Over Opinions. We also study the follow-
ing optimization problem. Here, the social network is given and we wish to modify the agents’
innate opinions to minimize polarization and disagreement at equilibrium. This problem aims to
understand the eﬀect of targeted ads or recommendations designed to inﬂuence innate opinions.

Problem 2 Given a network G on n agents, each with its own initial opinion, an opinion
dynamics model, and a budget α > 0, how should we change the initial opinions using total
opinion mass at most α in order to minimize polarization and disagreement?

• Experiments. We evaluate our methods on synthetic and real data. Our ﬁndings indicate that
our graph optimization methods result in signiﬁcantly lower levels of polarization and disagreement
on Twitter and Reddit, and conﬁrm that our proposed methods can be used as mining tools to better
understand the eﬀects of link recommendation. We also observe experimentally that existing graph
topologies are far away from optimizing polarization and disagreement. For instance, our proposed
method shows that we can obtain a 6.2 × 104-fold reduction in polarization and disagreement by
optimizing the graph topology of our Reddit dataset.

Roadmap. The paper is organized as follows: Section 2 presents related work. Section 3 presents
our algorithmic contributions. Section 4 presents experimental ﬁndings on synthetic and real-world
data. Finally, Section 5 concludes the paper.

Notation. We use the following notation throughout our paper. Let G(V, E, w) be a weighted
connected undirected graph, with V = [n] and |E| = m. Let N (i) be the neighborhood of node
i and d(i) = (cid:80)
wij be its degree. Let A be the adjacency matrix, and L def= D − A be the

j∈N (i)

combinatorial Laplacian. Here D = diag(d(1), . . . , d(n)) is a diagonal matrix with the degrees in
its diagonal. Each agent i ∈ V has an innate opinion si ∈ [0, 1]. Let s = (s1, . . . , sn) ∈ [0, 1]n be
the vector of innate opinions. Finally, let (cid:126)1,(cid:126)0 be the all-ones and all-zeros vectors respectively.

2 Related Work

To the best of our knowledge, we are the ﬁrst to formally deﬁne and study the problems suggested
in Section 1. In the following we review related work.

Modeling opinion dynamics. Opinion dynamics has been a topic of intense study by political
scientists, economists, sociologists, physicists, control systems scientists, and computer scientists,
among others. Opinion dynamics model social learning processes. Such models have important
applications in understanding political voting (e.g., [9, 1]), viral marketing (e.g., [15]), and various
other phenomena that take place in social media (e.g., [43]). There exist discrete and continuous
models. In the former, agents have only two possible opinions, 0 or 1. In the latter, opinions span

2

a continuous range; popular choices in the literature are intervals [0, 1], and [−1, 1]. The voter
model is a popular discrete model that was originally described by Cliﬀord and Sudbury [11] in the
context of a spatial conﬂict between animals for territory. In general, discrete models apply various
interaction mechanisms that may update an agent’s opinion. Such mechanisms include randomly
adopting the opinion of a connected neighbor or applying a local majority rule [19].

DeGroot introduced a continuous opinion dynamics model in his seminal work on consensus
formation [17]. A set of n individuals in society start with initial opinions on a subject. Individual
opinions are updated using the average of the neighborhood of a ﬁxed social network. Friedkin
and Johnsen [23] extended the DeGroot model to include both disagreement and consensus by
mixing each individual’s innate belief with some weight into the averaging process. We discuss this
model in greater detail below. Other continuous models are the Hegselmann-Krause model [29]
and the Deﬀuant-Weisbuch model [52]. Das, Gollapudi, Munagala use a model which combines the
continuous and discrete approach to ﬁt opinion data better [15]. Bhawalkar, Gollapudi, Munagala
study the scenario where the network and the agents’ opinions co-evolve [4].

It is worth mentioning that many aspects of opinion formation have been incorporated into
existing models such as opinion leaders, external inﬂuences and many others. We refer the interested
reader to the excellent survey by Mossel and Tamuz and references therein for more related work
on opinion dynamics models [36].

Friedkin-Johnsen opinion dynamics. Each node maintains a persistent internal (or innate)
opinion si, that remains constant. The node updates its expressed opinion zi through repeated
averaging. More precisely, if wij ≥ 0 is the weight on edge (i, j) ∈ E and N (i) denotes the
neighborhood of node i, then in one time step agent i updates its opinion to be the average

zi =

si + (cid:80)
j∈N (i)
1 + (cid:80)

wijzj

.

wij

j∈N (i)

Let z∗ be the equilibrium of this process. The value z∗
node i. It is well-known that the equilibrium z∗ is the solution to a linear system of equations:

i at equilibrium is the expressed opinion of

z∗ =(I + L)−1s [Friedkin-Johnsen Equilibrium]

(1)

Here L is the combinatorial Laplacian of the connection graph G. Notice that (I + L) is always
invertible since it is positive deﬁnite (in fact, all of its eigenvalues are greater than or equal to
1). The Friedkin-Johnsen model has been used by Bindel et al. as a model for understanding the
price of anarchy in society when individuals selﬁshly update their opinions in order to minimize
the stress they experience [5]. Here, stress consists of two terms, the stress due to the fact that
node i at equilibrium may express a diﬀerent opinion than its innate one, and the diﬀerence of its
expressed opinion and the expressed opinions of its neighbors. Formally, the stress of a node i is
j )2. Gionis, Terzi, and Tsaparas use this model to suggest
deﬁned as (z∗

i − si)2 + (cid:80)

i − z∗

wij(z∗

a variation of inﬂuence maximization [28].

j∈N (i)

Polarization. Munson et al. have created a browser widget that measures the bias of users based
on the news articles they read, and suggests articles of the opposing view to reduce polarization
[37]. Liao and Fu provide a tool that makes users aware of the extremity of their opinion, and how

3

well justiﬁed it is given their expertise on the topic [34]. Dandekar et al. deﬁne a polarizing opinion
formation process that increases a disagreement index at the end of the process, show limitations
of existing linear models to capture extreme polarization, and suggest a non-linear model [14].
Flaxman et al. study political “echo-chambers” by examining browsing histories and show several
interesting empirical ﬁndings with respect to how social networks aﬀect humans’ opinions [21].

Closest to our work lies that of Matakos et al. [35]. In their work, they focus on the (cid:96)2 norm
of the equilibrium vector z∗ under the Friedkin-Johnsen model, which is close to our measure of
polarization, introduced in Section 3.1, except that they do not mean center the opinion vector.
Given a parameter k, they consider the problem of choosing a set of k nodes such that if their
innate opinions are set to zero, the proposed polarization index will be minimized. This problem is
NP-hard, and focuses just on polarization, without considering disagreement. Close to our work at
a conceptual level also lies the work of Garimella, Morales, Gionis, and Mathioudakis [25], which
focuses on Twitter data. Garimella et al. create graphs from Twitter data, propose a new deﬁnition
of polarization, and detect topics that cause intense debates based on this measure. In follow-up
work, they consider the problem of making link recommendations to reduce polarization [26, 27].
Finally, an important aspect of using opinion dynamics with real data is opinion mining. For
example, how do we map tweets to opinions, i.e., real numbers? A lot of work in this area has
been done by the natural language processing (NLP) community; see the recent survey by Nakov
for more details on sentiment analysis and Twitter opinion mining [38].

Optimizing over graph topologies. Problem 1 (see Section 1) aims to optimize an objective
over graph topologies. We review some instances of related graph topology optimization problems,
most of which lie outside the graph mining literature, which has focused on edge recommendation
rather than global structural results.

In 2009, Daitch, Kelner, and Spielman suggested learning graphs that ﬁt vector points well
in order to leverage graph mining techniques for machine learning [12]. They propose using the
objective ||LX||2
F where L is the graph Laplacian and X is a data matrix representing n points
in d dimensions [12]. Their objective minimizes the reconstruction error over all points, where the
reconstruction error of a point is the (cid:96)2 norm of the diﬀerence of the point and the weighted average
of its neighbors. Other groups have considered related approaches; see for instance [18, 32].

The central problem in phylogenetics is to learn an evolutionary tree that explains the observed
existence of n species. A popular family of techniques are distance-based; ﬁnd an evolutionary
tree (whose leaves correspond to the species) which most closely matches a set of (cid:0)n
(cid:1) pairwise
2
genetic distances [20]. In machine learning, a wide variety of techniques (e.g., Chow-Liu) have been
introduced to learn graphical models from data via optimization problems over graph topologies
[33]. Boyd et al. have studied the problem of ﬁnding the fastest mixing Markov chain on a graph
[7, 48], casting it as an optimization problem over all possible weighted subgraphs of a given graph.

3 Proposed Method

3.1 Polarization and Disagreement

Following (1), let z∗ = (I + L)−1s be the equilibrium vector of opinions according to the Friedkin-
Johnsen model, for a social network G(V, E, w), and innate opinions s : V → [0, 1].

Disagreement. We deﬁne the disagreement d(u, v) of edge (u, v) as the squared diﬀerence between
the opinions of u, v at equilibrium: d(u, v) def= wuv(z∗
v)2. We deﬁne total disagreement DG,s as:

u − z∗

4

DG,s

def= (cid:80)

(u,v)∈E

d(u, v).

[Disagreement]

Polarization. Intuitively, polarization should measure how opinions at equilibrium deviate from
the average. There are many ways to quantify this. We choose the standard deﬁnition of variance,
i.e., the second moment of the opinions. Speciﬁcally, let ¯z be the mean-centered equilibrium vector:

Then the polarization PG,s is deﬁned to be:

¯z = z∗ −

z∗T(cid:126)1
n

(cid:126)1.

PG,s

def= (cid:80)
u∈V

u = ¯zT ¯z
¯z2

[Polarization]

We now introduce the Polarization-Disagreement index, i.e., the objective we care about.

IG,s

def= PG,s + DG,s

[Polarization-Disagreement index]

(2)

(3)

(4)

Two useful propositions and an observation follow.

Proposition 1 The disagreement DG,s satisﬁes the equation:

DG,s =

wuv(¯zu − ¯zv)2.

(cid:88)

(u,v)∈E

Proof. Let µ def= z∗T (cid:126)1
wuv(¯zu − ¯zv)2 = wuv(z∗

n be the mean of z∗, so the i-th coordinate of ¯z is ¯zi = z∗

i − µ. Now, observe that
v + µ)2 = d(u, v). The result follows by summing over all edges. (cid:3)

u − µ − z∗

Observation 1 The disagreement DG,s is a quadratic form. Speciﬁcally, DG,s = z∗T Lz∗, and by
Proposition 1, DG,s = ¯zT L¯z.

Proposition 2 Let ¯s = s− sT (cid:126)1
n

(cid:126)1 be the mean-centered innate opinion vector. Then, ¯z = (I +L)−1¯s.

Proof. For any graph, L(cid:126)1 = 0. Therefore (I + L)(cid:126)1 = (cid:126)1, or equivalently (cid:126)1 = (I + L)−1(cid:126)1. This implies
that z∗T(cid:126)1 = sT (I + L)−1(cid:126)1 = sT(cid:126)1. By these facts, we obtain that

¯z = z∗ −

(cid:126)1 = (I + L)−1s −

(cid:126)1 = (I + L)−1s −

z∗T(cid:126)1
n

sT(cid:126)1
n

(cid:126)1

z∗T(cid:126)1
n

= (I + L)−1(cid:0)s −

(cid:126)1(cid:1) = (I + L)−1¯s.

(cid:126)1T s
n

(cid:3)

Proposition 2 provides an alternative way of computing ¯z. We can either ﬁnd it in the obvious way,
i.e., ﬁnd z∗ and then center it around zero. Alternatively, we can ﬁrst center s around zero, and
then obtain ¯z as the Friedkin-Johnsen equilibrium when the innate opinion vector is ¯s.

Trade-oﬀ between polarization and disagreement. Before proceeding into any technical
details, we show a simple example that illustrates the trade-oﬀ between polarization and disagree-
ment. Suppose there are three agents, two of which have opinion 0, and one has opinion 1 on a
certain topic, i.e., s = [0, 0, 1]. We wish to recommend one link with weight 1 between these three
agents. The recommendation that agrees with human conﬁrmation bias, and therefore does not
cause any dissatisfaction to the three agents, is the edge between nodes 1 and 2. The equilibrium
opinion vector is the same as s, i.e., z∗ = [0, 0, 1]. The total disagreement is 0, and the polar-
ization is equal to (−1/3)2 + (−1/3)2 + (2/3)2 = 0.667. An alternative choice is to recommend
the edge between nodes 1, 3. The equilibrium now is [1/3, 0, 2/3]. The total polarization is equal
to 02 + (−1/3)2 + (1/3)2 = 0.222. The total disagreement is (2/3 − 1/3)2 = 0.111. Therefore,
the second recommendation resulted in a better outcome with respect to the sum of polarization
and disagreement. By symmetry, edge (2, 3) has the same eﬀect as edge (1, 3). The results are
summarized in Table 1.

3.2 Optimizing over Graph Topologies

Using the deﬁnitions of Section 3.1, we can now formulate Problem 1 from Section 1 mathematically.
The objective is to minimize the sum of two terms, polarization and disagreement. Here, L is the
set of valid combinatorial Laplacians of connected graphs. Observe that the trace of the Laplacian
is equal to twice the total edge weight of the corresponding graph.

Problem 1

minL∈Rn×n
subject to L ∈ L

¯zT ¯z + ¯zT L¯z

Tr(L) = 2m

(5)

Note that by (3) and Observation 1, ¯zT ¯z + ¯zT L¯z = DG,s + PG,s, where G is the weighted
graph corresponding to the Laplacian L. Thus (5) is equivalent to minimizing the polarization-
disagreement index IG,s over all graphs G with total edge weight m.

Theorem 1 The objective ¯zT ¯z + ¯zT L¯z is a convex function of the edge weights in the graph G
corresponding to the Laplacian L.

Proof. Using Proposition 2 we rewrite the objective as:

6

¯zT ¯z + ¯zT L¯z = ¯sT (I + L)−1(I + L)−1¯s + ¯sT (I + L)−1L(I + L)−1¯s

= ¯sT (I + L)−1(I + L)(I + L)−1¯s = ¯sT (I + L)−1¯s.

It is known that the function f (L) = (I + L)−1 is matrix-convex when L ∈ L and hence positive
semideﬁnite [40]. That is, for any λ ∈ (0, 1),

λZ−1

1 + (1 − λ)Z−1

2 (cid:23) (λZ1 + (1 − λ)Z2)−1.

This gives that xT (I + L)−1x is convex for all vectors x ∈ Rn. (cid:3)

Additionally, the set of Laplacians L which we optimize over is convex (standard fact).

Claim 1 The set L def= {Ln×n : L Laplacian, Tr(L) = 2m} is convex.

By Theorem 1 and Claim 1 we obtain that Problem 1 is solvable in polynomial time. One may
use gradient descent or second order methods, see [8]. In the following, we show how to compute
the gradient in a closed form in order to perform gradient descent more eﬃciently (compared to
relying on numerical approximations of it).
Gradient. Let N = (cid:0)n
(cid:1), and ei be the i-th standard basis vector in RN . We can write L =
2
B diag(w)BT where B ∈ Rn×N is the sign oriented incidence matrix and w ∈ RN is the vector of
edge weights for the graph G corresponding to L. Let bi be the i-th column of B, i = 1, . . . , N .
Observe that the graph Laplacian corresponding to the weight vector w + (cid:15)ei, is L + (cid:15)bibT
i . Hence,
if we perturb the i-th coordinate of any weight vector by (cid:15), i.e., to w + (cid:15)ei we obtain the Laplacian
L + (cid:15)bibT

i . The Sherman-Morrison formula for the matrix pseudo-inverse yields:

(I + L + (cid:15)bibT

i )+ = (I + L)−1 − (cid:15)

(I + L)−1bibT
1 + (cid:15)bT

i (I + L)−1

,

i (I + L)−1bi

and hence, thinking of (I + L)−1 as a matrix-valued function of w,

(cid:20)
(I + L)−1 − (cid:15)

(cid:15)→0

∂(I + L)−1
∂wi

(cid:21)

−(I + L)−1bibT

i (I + L)−1.

Therefore, by linearity, and the fact that the objective ¯zT ¯z + ¯zT L¯z = ¯sT (I + L)−1¯s as shown in

Theorem 1,

∂sT (I + L)−1s
∂wi

= −sT (I + L)−1bibT

i (I + L)−1s.

Non-convexity. Perhaps surprisingly, a slightly more general form of our objective, where one of
the two terms is multiplied by any factor ρ ≥ 0 (i.e., polarization and disagreement are weighted
diﬀerently), is not convex!

7

Theorem 2 Let ρ¯zT ¯z + ¯zT L¯z, ρ ≥ 0 be our objective. For ρ = 0, the objective is a non-convex
function of the edge weights.

Proof. By Propositions 1 and 2 we obtain that

z∗T Lz∗ = ¯zT L¯z = ¯sT (I + L)−1L(I + L)−1¯s.

To prove that this is not convex, it suﬃces to prove that f (L) = (I + L)−1L(I + L)−1 is non-convex.
Let L1, L2 ∈ L. Assume for the sake of contradiction that f (L) = (I + L)−1L(I + L)−1 is convex.
Then, the following follows by convexity for any λ ∈ (0, 1),

λf (L1) + (1 − λ)f (L2) (cid:23) f (λL1 + (1 − λ)L2) →
λ(I + L1)−1L1(I + L1)−1 + (1 − λ)(I + L2)−1L2(I + L2)−1 (cid:23)
(I + λL1 + (1 − λ)L2)−1(λL1 + (1 − λ)L2)(I + λL1 + (1 − λ)L2)−1.

Set λ = 0.5, and consider the following two Laplacian matrices corresponding to two paths on

3 nodes.

 .

It is easy to verify numerically that the minimum eigenvalue of λ(I + L1)−1L1(I + L1)−1 + (1 −
λ)(I + L2)−1L2(I + L2)−1 − (I + λL1 + (1 − λ)L2)−1(λL1 + (1 − λ)L2)(I + λL1 + (1 − λ)L2)−1 is
negative. This contradicts the convexity assumption of f (L). (cid:3)

We note that it is easy to construct more counterexamples for other ρ values (details omitted).

Finally, we prove that there always exists a graph with O( n

(cid:15)2 ) edges that lies within a multi-
plicative (1 ± (cid:15) + O((cid:15)2)) factor of the optimal – that is, approximately minimizing the polarization-
disagreement index IG,s does not require a dense graph G. Our proof relies on the seminal work
on spectral sparsiﬁcation [45, 46, 3, 47]. The next theorem proves a sub-optimal result in terms
of the number of edges in G, but uses the sparsiﬁcation algorithm due to Spielman and Srivastava
based eﬀective resistances, which has the advantages of being fast and easy to implement [45].

Theorem 3 There always exists a graph G with O(n log n/(cid:15)2) edges that achieves polarization-
disagreement index IG,s within a multiplicative (1 + (cid:15) + O((cid:15)2)) factor of optimal for Problem 1.

Proof. Let L be the Laplacian that minimizes the sum of polarization and disagreement subject to
total edge weight constraint m, i.e, the solution to (5). By applying the Spielman-Srivastava algo-
rithm to L with error parameter (cid:15)(cid:48), we obtain a spectral sparsiﬁer whose combinatorial Laplacian
˜L satisﬁes for any x ∈ Rn:

(1 − (cid:15)(cid:48))xT Lx ≤ xT ˜Lx ≤ (1 + (cid:15)(cid:48))xT Lx.

(6)

This in turn implies,

(1 − (cid:15)(cid:48))xT (L + I)x ≤ xT ( ˜L + I)x ≤ (1 + (cid:15)(cid:48))xT (L + I)x →
1
1 + (cid:15)(cid:48) xT (L + I)−1x ≤ xT ( ˜L + I)−1x ≤
1 − (cid:15)(cid:48) xT (L + I)−1x.

By setting x = s, OP T def= sT (L + I)−1s, and using the Taylor expansion for the fraction 1
1 + (cid:15)(cid:48) + O((cid:15)(cid:48)2) when (cid:15)(cid:48) is small, we obtain that sT ( ˜L + I)−1s ≤ (cid:0)1 + (cid:15)(cid:48) + O((cid:15)(cid:48)2)(cid:1) · OP T .

1−(cid:15)(cid:48) =

Note that we may not have Tr( ˜L) = 2m. However, by (6), Tr( ˜L) ≤ (1 + (cid:15)(cid:48)) Tr(L) = (1 +
(cid:15)(cid:48))2m. Thus we can scale ˜L to have trace Tr( ˜L) = 2m and will still have sT ( ˜L + I)−1s ≤ 1
1+(cid:15)(cid:48) ·
(cid:0)1 + (cid:15)(cid:48) + O((cid:15)(cid:48)2)(cid:1) · OP T ≤ (cid:0)(1 + (cid:15) + O((cid:15)2)(cid:1) · OP T if we set (cid:15)(cid:48) = (cid:15)/2. Finally, notice that sT ( ˜L +
I)−1s ≥ sT (L + I)−1s = OP T since L is the optimizer of (5). (cid:3)

As mentioned, we use the Spielman-Srivastava sparsiﬁcation algorithm [45] in our proof since
we use it in our experiments. However, a follow-up result due to Batson-Spielman-Srivastava [3]
reduces the number of edges to linear in the number of nodes. Using the same mathematical
arguments, but invoking [3] instead of [45] we obtain the following corollary of Theorem 3.

Corollary 1 There always exists a graph with O(n/(cid:15)2) edges that achieves polarization-disagreement
index IG,s within a multiplicative (1 + (cid:15) + O((cid:15)2)) factor of the optimal for Problem 1.

3.3 Optimizing over Innate Opinions

We next give a mathematical formulation of Problem 2. We show how to simplify this formulation
to obtain a convex optimization program (speciﬁcally, an SDP) which can be solved in polynomial
time using standard algorithms [8].

Equation (7) provides a straight-forward way to model our problem. We wish to minimize the
sum of polarization and disagreement subject to the structure implied by the dynamics, and a total
budget α on the total change of innate opinions. The variable we optimize over is ds, the change
in opinions. We restrict this change to decrease the innate opinions, i.e., ds ≤ (cid:126)0.

Our main result is the following proposition.

Proposition 3 The formulation of Problem 2 in (7) is solvable in polynomial time.

Proof. We can simplify the objective of (7) using our analysis from Section 3.2. Speciﬁcally, our

problem is equivalent to

(cid:126)1T ds ≥ −α
s + ds ≥ (cid:126)0

By expanding the above objective, we observe that it is a standard quadratic form xT Qx + 2bT x + c
where Q def= (I + L)−1 is symmetric positive semideﬁnite, b = (I + L)−1s and c = sT (I + L)−1s
(note that b, c are ﬁxed with respect to the variable ds). This objective is convex, and the set of
constraints form a convex set, proving the Proposition. (cid:3)

We remark that the above convex formulation (7) can accommodate other types constraints, such as
restricting ds to be in a speciﬁc range of values, or allowing positive changes in the innate opinions.
In our experimental section, we use the basic formulation without additional constraints.

4 Experimental results

4.1 Experimental Setup

Datasets. We use two datasets collected by De et al.
[16]. Speciﬁcally, De et al. collect text
produced by users, and interactions between them [16]. The text is mapped into opinions using
NLP tools [42], and the interactions are used to create a network between users. There are many
preprocessing details, which can be found in [16]. Here, we provide a brief description of both
datasets.

Twitter is a network with n = 548 nodes, and m = 3,638 edges. Edges correspond to user
interactions. All nodes’ opinions are available to us. This dataset was collected with the aim
of analyzing the debate on Twitter about the Delhi legislative assembly elections of 2013. This
was an irresolute event with three major parties winning roughly equal shares of the vote. The
hashtags used to collect tweets were #BJP, #APP, #Congress, #Polls2013, tweeted over the period
December 9th to 15th.

Reddit is a network with n = 556 and m = 8,969 edges. There is an edge between two users
if there exist two subreddits (other than politics) that both users posted in during the given time
period. The topic of interest is politics.

Aside from the above real-world datasets, we use a wide variety of synthetic data. Since most
real-world networks have a skewed degree distributions, we focus on power law random networks
generated using the Norros-Reittu model [41], an important random graph model that produces
networks that mimic real-world networks in some respects [2, 24]. We also use skewed distributions
for generating opinions. We use the randht.m ﬁle by Aaron Clauset [10] to generate opinions
according to a power law with a given slope. We normalize opinions to the range [0, 1] by dividing
by the maximum observed value (i.e., there is always a node with opinion 1).

Machine specs. All experiments were run on a laptop with 1.7 GHz Intel Core i7 processor and
8GB of main memory.

correspond to generating innate opinions s according to a power law distribution with slopes 1.5,
2, and 2.5 respectively. For details see Section 4.2.

4.2 Experimental Findings

Synthetic experiments. Table 2 shows our results on learning optimal graph topologies (i.e.
solving Problem 1) for various innate opinion vectors averaged over 5 experiments. Each row
corresponds to sampling a vector of 100 innate opinions according to the power law distribution
with slopes 1.5, 2, and 2.5 respectively. Column L∗ shows the objective value achieved by our
optimization algorithm, and the last column shows the ˜L∗-sparsiﬁed the objective value after we
sparsify L∗ using the Spielman-Srivastava algorithm (see Theorem 3). We observe a negligible
loss, but achieve a dramatic reduction in the number of edges. The optimal solution L∗ in all
experiments corresponds to a weighted clique, i.e., there are 4950 non-zero edges. The sparsiﬁed
versions of the optimal solution have on average 761, 697, and 700 edges for the three diﬀerent
distributions on s respectively.

For comparison, in Table 2 we also show the polarization-disagreement index for several ran-
domly generated graphs. The ﬁrst column shows the results obtained by a random binomial graph,
i.e., an Erd¨os-R´enyi graph. We use p = 0.5 as the underlying edge probability. We also generate
power law networks according to the Norros-Reittu model with slopes 2, 2.5, and 3 respectively.
In general, we observe that random binomial graphs achieve a close-to-optimal performance, in
contrast to power law networks. Understanding this observation using formal random graph theory
[24] is an interesting direction for future research. We also observe empirically that the polarization-
disagreement index increases as the slope of the random network increases from 2 to 3.

Figure 1 shows our experimental ﬁndings when we optimize over innate opinions. We generate
power-law random graphs using the Norros-Reittu model with slope 2, a slope that lies close to
the slopes of several real-world networks [39]. Similarly we generate random initial opinion vectors
according to various distributions. The ﬁrst row (Figures 1(a),(b),(c),(d)) corresponds to uniform
innate opinions. The second row (Figures 1(e),(f),(g),(h)) to power law opinions with slope 2, and
the third row (Figures 1(i),(j),(k),((cid:96))) to slope 5. For the fourth row (Figures 1(m),(n),(o),(p))
we set the opinion of each node v deterministically to
u deg(u) . This setting allows us to clearly
see if the algorithm chooses to change the innate opinions of only the highest degree nodes, or
if the graph topology forces the algorithm to choose other nodes (which is actually the case).
The ﬁrst column (Figures 1(a),(e),(i),(m)) plots the degree of each node versus its innate opinion.
Figures 1(b)(f)(j),(n), and Figures 1(c),(g),(k),(o) plot the optimal change ds for each node versus
its innate opinion for budgets α = 5, and α = 20 respectively. We observe that the optimization
algorithm tends to prefer to reduce high innate opinions. However we can also observe that graph
topology plays a key role, as in certain cases it changes opinions of nodes with lower innate opinions

even if it could choose higher innate opinions. This is obvious in all ﬁgures, but most striking in
Figure 1(n); the algorithm does not modify the node with innate opinion 1 when the budget is
5, but only modiﬁes other nodes. Similar remarks can be made for the rest of the ﬁgures. This
fact is more pronounced when α = 5 than when α = 20. since as the budget α increases, the
algorithm can always reduce the values of the highest innate opinions, caring less and less about
the graph topology. Finally, Figures 1(d),(h), ((cid:96)), (p) plot the opinion vector at equilibrium after
our algorithm’s intervention (i.e, z = (I + L)−1(s + ds)), when the budget is 20. We observe that
in all cases opinions get closer, but the actual value that they concentrate around depends on the
distribution. For instance, in Figure 1(d) we observe concentration around 0.5 but in Figure 1(h)
around 0. This should not be very surprising; the average of the uniform opinion distribution is
0.5, whereas when s is distributed as a power law distribution, most of the values initially are close

12

to 0. The results presented in Figure 1 are representative observations across many experiments.

edges for the Twitter and Reddit networks. Second row shows the objective and the number of
edges for the optimal solution. Third row shows the objective and the number of edges for the
sparsiﬁed optimal solution. For details, see Section 4.2.

Real-world experiments. Table 3 summarizes our experimental results for the Twitter and
Reddit datasets. Given the Twitter network among the users, and their innate opinions, the
polarization-disagreement index IG,s is equal to 199.84. By optimizing over graph topologies, we
ﬁnd a graph G∗ with the same total weight 8,969 as the original graph that reduces the polarization-
disagreement index to 30.113. However, this optimal graph is dense; the total weight is spread
over 120,000 edges. By sparsifying using eﬀective resistances according to Spielman-Srivastava,
we obtain a sparse graph using just 3,455 edges. The polarization-disagreement index is equal to
30.114. Again, we observe that there is a negligible change in the objective value (on the order of
10−3), but there is a drastic reduction in the number of edges.

The results for Reddit are impressive; the polarization-disagreement index reduces from 199.84
to 0.0022. Both the original graph and the optimal graph have the same total weight. The weight
of the optimal graph is spread over 103,050 edges, but by sparsifying we get a graph with 7,521
edges with polarization-disagreement index 0.0022; the diﬀerence from the optimal value is < 10−5.
We checked the structure of our optimal graphs, suspecting that two clusters would emerge.
Speciﬁcally, we centered the innate vector s around the mean, and we obtained two sets of nodes:
those with innate opinions below the mean, and those with innate opinions above the mean. Intu-
itively, small disagreement graphs should have a strong community structure on these two sets of
nodes, and small polarization graphs should have a large max cut (edges across the two groups).
The optimal graphs do not exhibit such a clear two-block structure, but look closer to being ran-
dom. Combined with our ﬁnding on random binomial graphs from the synthetic experiments, it is
an interesting question whether random binomial graphs are indeed close to the optimal solution
for any initial opinion vector.

Runtime-wise, the optimization took a couple of hours for each network; observe that the total
number of variables grows as O(n2). It is an open question to come up with an eﬃcient primal-
dual procedure that takes advantage of speciﬁc features of our convex programs and Theorem 3 to
improve the overall runtime.

We also considered the problem of optimizing the vector of innate opinions using diﬀerent
budget values. We show how the equilibria opinions vectors look before and after intervention.
Figures 2(b)(c) show four opinion vectors permuted according to the sorting permutation of s
for Twitter and Reddit respectively: the vector of innate opinions s that is sorted, the original
equilibrium vector, and two optimized equilibria vectors, when the budget is 5, and 20 respectively.

We observe that nodes’ opinions converge closer and closer to the average, achieving signiﬁcantly
lower objective values as the budget increases.

5 Conclusion

Humans tend to prefer links that minimize disagreement due to the well-known conﬁrmation bias,
among other reasons. However, this may lead to polarized communities. In this work we intro-
duce the notion of the polarization-disagreement index to understand better this trade-oﬀ between
disagreement and polarization in online social networks and online social media. To the best of
our knowledge, we provide the ﬁrst formulation for ﬁnding an optimal topology which minimizes
the sum of polarization and disagreement under a popular opinion formation model. We prove
interesting facts about our objective, including the fact that there is always a graph with O(n/(cid:15)2)
edges that provides a (1 + (cid:15)) approximation to the optimal objective. We also provide eﬃcient
procedures to optimize the objective. We complement our results on optimizing graph topologies,
by considering a version of the problem where we optimize over innate opinions for a ﬁxed network.

14

Our proposed tools provide useful information about the importance of certain edges and nodes
with respect to opinion formation. We provide an extensive empirical study of our results using
synthetic data and two real-world datasets (Twitter, and Reddit).

Our work opens many interesting questions. We used the popular Friedkin-Johnsen opinion
formation model, which takes into account both consensus and disagreement in the underlying
opinion update process. The same questions we asked here can be also asked using other opinion
formation models [36]. Our experimental results strongly indicate that Erd¨os-R´enyi graphs are
not far away from achieving the optimal polarization-disagreement index IG,s. Can we prove that
Erd¨os-R´enyi graphs are always a good approximation to the optimal solution? If yes, can we prove
a similar result for expanders? Do links that cross communities always improve the polarization-
disagreement index, or not? Another interesting research direction is understanding how well
we can approximate the non-convex objective of Theorem 2, where a weighting is added to the
polarization-disagreement index. Furthermore, we focused on disagreement and polarization, two
key phenomena in human societies. Can we develop a similar framework for optimizing other
mathematical objectives for social good?

Abstract

The rise of social media and online social networks has been a disruptive force in society.
Opinions are increasingly shaped by interactions on online social media, and social phenomena
including disagreement and polarization are now tightly woven into everyday life. In this work
we initiate the study of the following question:

Given n agents, each with its own initial opinion that reﬂects its core value on a
topic, and an opinion dynamics model, what is the structure of a social network that
minimizes polarization and disagreement simultaneously?

This question is central to recommender systems: should a recommender system prefer a link
suggestion between two online users with similar mindsets in order to keep disagreement low,
or between two users with diﬀerent opinions in order to expose each to the other’s viewpoint of
the world, and decrease overall levels of polarization? Such decisions have an important global
eﬀect on society [51]. Our contributions include a mathematical formalization of this question
as an optimization problem and an exact, time-eﬃcient algorithm. We also prove that there
always exists a network with O(n/(cid:15)2) edges that is a (1 + (cid:15)) approximation to the optimum.
Our formulation is an instance of optimization over graph topologies, also considered e.g., in
[7, 12, 48]. For a ﬁxed graph, we additionally show how to optimize our objective function over
the agents’ innate opinions in polynomial time.

We perform an empirical study of our proposed methods on synthetic and real-world data
that verify their value as mining tools to better understand the trade-oﬀ between of disagreement
and polarization. We ﬁnd that there is a lot of space to reduce both polarization and disagree-
ment in real-world networks; for instance, on a Reddit network where users exchange comments
on politics, our methods achieve a ∼ 60 000-fold reduction in polarization and disagreement.

Introduction

The enormous popularity of social media and online social networks has led to fundamental changes
in how humans share and form opinions. Several events have stirred ﬁerce debates online, such
as the internal memo of James Damore at Google that leaked online and showed how society and
users of social media become strongly polarized around controversial issues [13]. Social phenomena
such as disagreement and polarization that have existed in human societies for millenia, are now
taking place in an online virtual world, with a huge impact on society. Furthermore, opinions
are increasingly shaped by social media. For this reason Facebook’s recommender systems were
recently accused of inﬂuencing voters by propagating fake news and Russian ads during the U.S.
national elections [49], thus stirring additional controversy about the role of tech giants in society.
Google has faced similar accusations about inﬂuencing the outcome of elections [44].

From a business perspective, recommender systems aim to maximize revenue – some in the short-
term, others in the long-term – by optimizing mathematical objectives related to click-through rate
and user engagement. However, given the increasing power of tech-giants like Facebook and Google,
a better understanding of the eﬀect of recommended links on society is required [50].

The following facts motivate our work. Valdis Krebs analyzed purchasing trends on Amazon.
He found that during the 2008 presidential elections, people who already supported Barack Obama
tended to be the same people buying books that painted him in a positive light. Similarly, people
who disliked him, bought books that painted him in a negative light [30, Chapter 1]. This bias
is known as conﬁrmation bias [31], and lies at the root of the spread of conspiracy theories and
fake news. Put simply, most humans avoid challenging their opinions. Therefore, a recommender
system trained on real-data, whose goal is to maximize revenue and increase user engagement,
may naturally end up creating “echo-chambers”. Equivalently, the recommended links minimize
the disagreement that the user experiences. In the context of social networks, connections between
users with similar mindsets are preferred over connections between users with diﬀerent mindsets.
On the other hand, minimizing disagreement leads to greater polarization. To see intuitively
why this is the case, consider a topic with two prevalent opinions such as supporting either Demo-
crat or Republican politics. As users connect to users with similar mindsets, two clusters with
strong and extreme opinions are formed, leading to greater polarization between the two groups
[6]. This polarization has harmful eﬀects on society; for example, reaching political consensus be-
comes much harder. This trade-oﬀ between disagreement and polarization motivates our work. We
are interested in understanding the structure of a social network that minimizes both disagree-
ment and polarization. We introduce and study two key problems, summarized below. For both
problems, we use as our underlying opinion dynamics model the Friedkin-Johnsen model [22] that
includes both disagreement and consensus, as it associates each node with an innate opinion and
an expressed opinion. For details see Section 2.

• Minimizing Polarization and Disagreement Over Graphs. We initiate the study of the
following important question in understanding the global eﬀect of recommended connections in
social networks on society. We formalize this problem mathematically, and provide a polynomial
time algorithm by proving that our optimization formulation is convex. Our formulation is an
instance of optimization over graph topologies. For other such optimization problems, see [7, 12, 48].

1

Problem 1 Given n agents, each with its own initial opinion that reﬂects its core value on
a topic, and an opinion dynamics model, what is the structure of a connected social network
with a given total edge weight that minimizes polarization and disagreement simultaneously?

We additionally prove that there always exists a graph with at most O(n/(cid:15)2) edges that achieves
a (1 + (cid:15))-approximation to the above problem. That is, disagreement and polarization can be
minimized by very sparsely connected networks.

• Minimizing Polarization and Disagreement Over Opinions. We also study the follow-
ing optimization problem. Here, the social network is given and we wish to modify the agents’
innate opinions to minimize polarization and disagreement at equilibrium. This problem aims to
understand the eﬀect of targeted ads or recommendations designed to inﬂuence innate opinions.

Problem 2 Given a network G on n agents, each with its own initial opinion, an opinion
dynamics model, and a budget α > 0, how should we change the initial opinions using total
opinion mass at most α in order to minimize polarization and disagreement?

• Experiments. We evaluate our methods on synthetic and real data. Our ﬁndings indicate that
our graph optimization methods result in signiﬁcantly lower levels of polarization and disagreement
on Twitter and Reddit, and conﬁrm that our proposed methods can be used as mining tools to better
understand the eﬀects of link recommendation. We also observe experimentally that existing graph
topologies are far away from optimizing polarization and disagreement. For instance, our proposed
method shows that we can obtain a 6.2 × 104-fold reduction in polarization and disagreement by
optimizing the graph topology of our Reddit dataset.

Roadmap. The paper is organized as follows: Section 2 presents related work. Section 3 presents
our algorithmic contributions. Section 4 presents experimental ﬁndings on synthetic and real-world
data. Finally, Section 5 concludes the paper.

Notation. We use the following notation throughout our paper. Let G(V, E, w) be a weighted
connected undirected graph, with V = [n] and |E| = m. Let N (i) be the neighborhood of node
i and d(i) = (cid:80)
wij be its degree. Let A be the adjacency matrix, and L def= D − A be the

j∈N (i)

combinatorial Laplacian. Here D = diag(d(1), . . . , d(n)) is a diagonal matrix with the degrees in
its diagonal. Each agent i ∈ V has an innate opinion si ∈ [0, 1]. Let s = (s1, . . . , sn) ∈ [0, 1]n be
the vector of innate opinions. Finally, let (cid:126)1,(cid:126)0 be the all-ones and all-zeros vectors respectively.

2 Related Work

To the best of our knowledge, we are the ﬁrst to formally deﬁne and study the problems suggested
in Section 1. In the following we review related work.

Modeling opinion dynamics. Opinion dynamics has been a topic of intense study by political
scientists, economists, sociologists, physicists, control systems scientists, and computer scientists,
among others. Opinion dynamics model social learning processes. Such models have important
applications in understanding political voting (e.g., [9, 1]), viral marketing (e.g., [15]), and various
other phenomena that take place in social media (e.g., [43]). There exist discrete and continuous
models. In the former, agents have only two possible opinions, 0 or 1. In the latter, opinions span

2

a continuous range; popular choices in the literature are intervals [0, 1], and [−1, 1]. The voter
model is a popular discrete model that was originally described by Cliﬀord and Sudbury [11] in the
context of a spatial conﬂict between animals for territory. In general, discrete models apply various
interaction mechanisms that may update an agent’s opinion. Such mechanisms include randomly
adopting the opinion of a connected neighbor or applying a local majority rule [19].

DeGroot introduced a continuous opinion dynamics model in his seminal work on consensus
formation [17]. A set of n individuals in society start with initial opinions on a subject. Individual
opinions are updated using the average of the neighborhood of a ﬁxed social network. Friedkin
and Johnsen [23] extended the DeGroot model to include both disagreement and consensus by
mixing each individual’s innate belief with some weight into the averaging process. We discuss this
model in greater detail below. Other continuous models are the Hegselmann-Krause model [29]
and the Deﬀuant-Weisbuch model [52]. Das, Gollapudi, Munagala use a model which combines the
continuous and discrete approach to ﬁt opinion data better [15]. Bhawalkar, Gollapudi, Munagala
study the scenario where the network and the agents’ opinions co-evolve [4].

It is worth mentioning that many aspects of opinion formation have been incorporated into
existing models such as opinion leaders, external inﬂuences and many others. We refer the interested
reader to the excellent survey by Mossel and Tamuz and references therein for more related work
on opinion dynamics models [36].

Friedkin-Johnsen opinion dynamics. Each node maintains a persistent internal (or innate)
opinion si, that remains constant. The node updates its expressed opinion zi through repeated
averaging. More precisely, if wij ≥ 0 is the weight on edge (i, j) ∈ E and N (i) denotes the
neighborhood of node i, then in one time step agent i updates its opinion to be the average

zi =

si + (cid:80)
j∈N (i)
1 + (cid:80)

wijzj

.

wij

j∈N (i)

Let z∗ be the equilibrium of this process. The value z∗
node i. It is well-known that the equilibrium z∗ is the solution to a linear system of equations:

i at equilibrium is the expressed opinion of

z∗ =(I + L)−1s [Friedkin-Johnsen Equilibrium]

(1)

Here L is the combinatorial Laplacian of the connection graph G. Notice that (I + L) is always
invertible since it is positive deﬁnite (in fact, all of its eigenvalues are greater than or equal to
1). The Friedkin-Johnsen model has been used by Bindel et al. as a model for understanding the
price of anarchy in society when individuals selﬁshly update their opinions in order to minimize
the stress they experience [5]. Here, stress consists of two terms, the stress due to the fact that
node i at equilibrium may express a diﬀerent opinion than its innate one, and the diﬀerence of its
expressed opinion and the expressed opinions of its neighbors. Formally, the stress of a node i is
j )2. Gionis, Terzi, and Tsaparas use this model to suggest
deﬁned as (z∗

i − si)2 + (cid:80)

i − z∗

wij(z∗

a variation of inﬂuence maximization [28].

j∈N (i)

Polarization. Munson et al. have created a browser widget that measures the bias of users based
on the news articles they read, and suggests articles of the opposing view to reduce polarization
[37]. Liao and Fu provide a tool that makes users aware of the extremity of their opinion, and how

3

well justiﬁed it is given their expertise on the topic [34]. Dandekar et al. deﬁne a polarizing opinion
formation process that increases a disagreement index at the end of the process, show limitations
of existing linear models to capture extreme polarization, and suggest a non-linear model [14].
Flaxman et al. study political “echo-chambers” by examining browsing histories and show several
interesting empirical ﬁndings with respect to how social networks aﬀect humans’ opinions [21].

Closest to our work lies that of Matakos et al. [35]. In their work, they focus on the (cid:96)2 norm
of the equilibrium vector z∗ under the Friedkin-Johnsen model, which is close to our measure of
polarization, introduced in Section 3.1, except that they do not mean center the opinion vector.
Given a parameter k, they consider the problem of choosing a set of k nodes such that if their
innate opinions are set to zero, the proposed polarization index will be minimized. This problem is
NP-hard, and focuses just on polarization, without considering disagreement. Close to our work at
a conceptual level also lies the work of Garimella, Morales, Gionis, and Mathioudakis [25], which
focuses on Twitter data. Garimella et al. create graphs from Twitter data, propose a new deﬁnition
of polarization, and detect topics that cause intense debates based on this measure. In follow-up
work, they consider the problem of making link recommendations to reduce polarization [26, 27].
Finally, an important aspect of using opinion dynamics with real data is opinion mining. For
example, how do we map tweets to opinions, i.e., real numbers? A lot of work in this area has
been done by the natural language processing (NLP) community; see the recent survey by Nakov
for more details on sentiment analysis and Twitter opinion mining [38].

Optimizing over graph topologies. Problem 1 (see Section 1) aims to optimize an objective
over graph topologies. We review some instances of related graph topology optimization problems,
most of which lie outside the graph mining literature, which has focused on edge recommendation
rather than global structural results.

In 2009, Daitch, Kelner, and Spielman suggested learning graphs that ﬁt vector points well
in order to leverage graph mining techniques for machine learning [12]. They propose using the
objective ||LX||2
F where L is the graph Laplacian and X is a data matrix representing n points
in d dimensions [12]. Their objective minimizes the reconstruction error over all points, where the
reconstruction error of a point is the (cid:96)2 norm of the diﬀerence of the point and the weighted average
of its neighbors. Other groups have considered related approaches; see for instance [18, 32].

The central problem in phylogenetics is to learn an evolutionary tree that explains the observed
existence of n species. A popular family of techniques are distance-based; ﬁnd an evolutionary
tree (whose leaves correspond to the species) which most closely matches a set of (cid:0)n
(cid:1) pairwise
2
genetic distances [20]. In machine learning, a wide variety of techniques (e.g., Chow-Liu) have been
introduced to learn graphical models from data via optimization problems over graph topologies
[33]. Boyd et al. have studied the problem of ﬁnding the fastest mixing Markov chain on a graph
[7, 48], casting it as an optimization problem over all possible weighted subgraphs of a given graph.

3 Proposed Method

3.1 Polarization and Disagreement

Following (1), let z∗ = (I + L)−1s be the equilibrium vector of opinions according to the Friedkin-
Johnsen model, for a social network G(V, E, w), and innate opinions s : V → [0, 1].

Disagreement. We deﬁne the disagreement d(u, v) of edge (u, v) as the squared diﬀerence between
the opinions of u, v at equilibrium: d(u, v) def= wuv(z∗
v)2. We deﬁne total disagreement DG,s as:

u − z∗

4

DG,s

def= (cid:80)

(u,v)∈E

d(u, v).

[Disagreement]

Polarization. Intuitively, polarization should measure how opinions at equilibrium deviate from
the average. There are many ways to quantify this. We choose the standard deﬁnition of variance,
i.e., the second moment of the opinions. Speciﬁcally, let ¯z be the mean-centered equilibrium vector:

Then the polarization PG,s is deﬁned to be:

¯z = z∗ −

z∗T(cid:126)1
n

(cid:126)1.

PG,s

def= (cid:80)
u∈V

u = ¯zT ¯z
¯z2

[Polarization]

We now introduce the Polarization-Disagreement index, i.e., the objective we care about.

IG,s

def= PG,s + DG,s

[Polarization-Disagreement index]

(2)

(3)

(4)

Two useful propositions and an observation follow.

Proposition 1 The disagreement DG,s satisﬁes the equation:

DG,s =

wuv(¯zu − ¯zv)2.

(cid:88)

(u,v)∈E

Proof. Let µ def= z∗T (cid:126)1
wuv(¯zu − ¯zv)2 = wuv(z∗

n be the mean of z∗, so the i-th coordinate of ¯z is ¯zi = z∗

i − µ. Now, observe that
v + µ)2 = d(u, v). The result follows by summing over all edges. (cid:3)

u − µ − z∗

Observation 1 The disagreement DG,s is a quadratic form. Speciﬁcally, DG,s = z∗T Lz∗, and by
Proposition 1, DG,s = ¯zT L¯z.

Proposition 2 Let ¯s = s− sT (cid:126)1
n

(cid:126)1 be the mean-centered innate opinion vector. Then, ¯z = (I +L)−1¯s.

Proof. For any graph, L(cid:126)1 = 0. Therefore (I + L)(cid:126)1 = (cid:126)1, or equivalently (cid:126)1 = (I + L)−1(cid:126)1. This implies
that z∗T(cid:126)1 = sT (I + L)−1(cid:126)1 = sT(cid:126)1. By these facts, we obtain that

¯z = z∗ −

(cid:126)1 = (I + L)−1s −

(cid:126)1 = (I + L)−1s −

z∗T(cid:126)1
n

sT(cid:126)1
n

(cid:126)1

z∗T(cid:126)1
n

= (I + L)−1(cid:0)s −

(cid:126)1(cid:1) = (I + L)−1¯s.

(cid:126)1T s
n

(cid:3)

Proposition 2 provides an alternative way of computing ¯z. We can either ﬁnd it in the obvious way,
i.e., ﬁnd z∗ and then center it around zero. Alternatively, we can ﬁrst center s around zero, and
then obtain ¯z as the Friedkin-Johnsen equilibrium when the innate opinion vector is ¯s.

Trade-oﬀ between polarization and disagreement. Before proceeding into any technical
details, we show a simple example that illustrates the trade-oﬀ between polarization and disagree-
ment. Suppose there are three agents, two of which have opinion 0, and one has opinion 1 on a
certain topic, i.e., s = [0, 0, 1]. We wish to recommend one link with weight 1 between these three
agents. The recommendation that agrees with human conﬁrmation bias, and therefore does not
cause any dissatisfaction to the three agents, is the edge between nodes 1 and 2. The equilibrium
opinion vector is the same as s, i.e., z∗ = [0, 0, 1]. The total disagreement is 0, and the polar-
ization is equal to (−1/3)2 + (−1/3)2 + (2/3)2 = 0.667. An alternative choice is to recommend
the edge between nodes 1, 3. The equilibrium now is [1/3, 0, 2/3]. The total polarization is equal
to 02 + (−1/3)2 + (1/3)2 = 0.222. The total disagreement is (2/3 − 1/3)2 = 0.111. Therefore,
the second recommendation resulted in a better outcome with respect to the sum of polarization
and disagreement. By symmetry, edge (2, 3) has the same eﬀect as edge (1, 3). The results are
summarized in Table 1.

3.2 Optimizing over Graph Topologies

Using the deﬁnitions of Section 3.1, we can now formulate Problem 1 from Section 1 mathematically.
The objective is to minimize the sum of two terms, polarization and disagreement. Here, L is the
set of valid combinatorial Laplacians of connected graphs. Observe that the trace of the Laplacian
is equal to twice the total edge weight of the corresponding graph.

Problem 1

minL∈Rn×n
subject to L ∈ L

¯zT ¯z + ¯zT L¯z

Tr(L) = 2m

(5)

Note that by (3) and Observation 1, ¯zT ¯z + ¯zT L¯z = DG,s + PG,s, where G is the weighted
graph corresponding to the Laplacian L. Thus (5) is equivalent to minimizing the polarization-
disagreement index IG,s over all graphs G with total edge weight m.

Theorem 1 The objective ¯zT ¯z + ¯zT L¯z is a convex function of the edge weights in the graph G
corresponding to the Laplacian L.

Proof. Using Proposition 2 we rewrite the objective as:

6

¯zT ¯z + ¯zT L¯z = ¯sT (I + L)−1(I + L)−1¯s + ¯sT (I + L)−1L(I + L)−1¯s

= ¯sT (I + L)−1(I + L)(I + L)−1¯s = ¯sT (I + L)−1¯s.

It is known that the function f (L) = (I + L)−1 is matrix-convex when L ∈ L and hence positive
semideﬁnite [40]. That is, for any λ ∈ (0, 1),

λZ−1

1 + (1 − λ)Z−1

2 (cid:23) (λZ1 + (1 − λ)Z2)−1.

This gives that xT (I + L)−1x is convex for all vectors x ∈ Rn. (cid:3)

Additionally, the set of Laplacians L which we optimize over is convex (standard fact).

Claim 1 The set L def= {Ln×n : L Laplacian, Tr(L) = 2m} is convex.

By Theorem 1 and Claim 1 we obtain that Problem 1 is solvable in polynomial time. One may
use gradient descent or second order methods, see [8]. In the following, we show how to compute
the gradient in a closed form in order to perform gradient descent more eﬃciently (compared to
relying on numerical approximations of it).
Gradient. Let N = (cid:0)n
(cid:1), and ei be the i-th standard basis vector in RN . We can write L =
2
B diag(w)BT where B ∈ Rn×N is the sign oriented incidence matrix and w ∈ RN is the vector of
edge weights for the graph G corresponding to L. Let bi be the i-th column of B, i = 1, . . . , N .
Observe that the graph Laplacian corresponding to the weight vector w + (cid:15)ei, is L + (cid:15)bibT
i . Hence,
if we perturb the i-th coordinate of any weight vector by (cid:15), i.e., to w + (cid:15)ei we obtain the Laplacian
L + (cid:15)bibT

i . The Sherman-Morrison formula for the matrix pseudo-inverse yields:

(I + L + (cid:15)bibT

i )+ = (I + L)−1 − (cid:15)

(I + L)−1bibT
1 + (cid:15)bT

i (I + L)−1

,

i (I + L)−1bi

and hence, thinking of (I + L)−1 as a matrix-valued function of w,

(cid:20)
(I + L)−1 − (cid:15)

(cid:15)→0

∂(I + L)−1
∂wi

Therefore, by linearity, and the fact that the objective ¯zT ¯z + ¯zT L¯z = ¯sT (I + L)−1¯s as shown in

Theorem 1,

∂sT (I + L)−1s
∂wi

= −sT (I + L)−1bibT

i (I + L)−1s.

Non-convexity. Perhaps surprisingly, a slightly more general form of our objective, where one of
the two terms is multiplied by any factor ρ ≥ 0 (i.e., polarization and disagreement are weighted
diﬀerently), is not convex!

7

Theorem 2 Let ρ¯zT ¯z + ¯zT L¯z, ρ ≥ 0 be our objective. For ρ = 0, the objective is a non-convex
function of the edge weights.

Proof. By Propositions 1 and 2 we obtain that

z∗T Lz∗ = ¯zT L¯z = ¯sT (I + L)−1L(I + L)−1¯s.

To prove that this is not convex, it suﬃces to prove that f (L) = (I + L)−1L(I + L)−1 is non-convex.
Let L1, L2 ∈ L. Assume for the sake of contradiction that f (L) = (I + L)−1L(I + L)−1 is convex.
Then, the following follows by convexity for any λ ∈ (0, 1),

λf (L1) + (1 − λ)f (L2) (cid:23) f (λL1 + (1 − λ)L2) →
λ(I + L1)−1L1(I + L1)−1 + (1 − λ)(I + L2)−1L2(I + L2)−1 (cid:23)
(I + λL1 + (1 − λ)L2)−1(λL1 + (1 − λ)L2)(I + λL1 + (1 − λ)L2)−1.

Set λ = 0.5, and consider the following two Laplacian matrices corresponding to two paths on

3 nodes.



, L2 =

 .

It is easy to verify numerically that the minimum eigenvalue of λ(I + L1)−1L1(I + L1)−1 + (1 −
λ)(I + L2)−1L2(I + L2)−1 − (I + λL1 + (1 − λ)L2)−1(λL1 + (1 − λ)L2)(I + λL1 + (1 − λ)L2)−1 is
negative. This contradicts the convexity assumption of f (L). (cid:3)

We note that it is easy to construct more counterexamples for other ρ values (details omitted).

Finally, we prove that there always exists a graph with O( n

(cid:15)2 ) edges that lies within a multi-
plicative (1 ± (cid:15) + O((cid:15)2)) factor of the optimal – that is, approximately minimizing the polarization-
disagreement index IG,s does not require a dense graph G. Our proof relies on the seminal work
on spectral sparsiﬁcation [45, 46, 3, 47]. The next theorem proves a sub-optimal result in terms
of the number of edges in G, but uses the sparsiﬁcation algorithm due to Spielman and Srivastava
based eﬀective resistances, which has the advantages of being fast and easy to implement [45].

Theorem 3 There always exists a graph G with O(n log n/(cid:15)2) edges that achieves polarization-
disagreement index IG,s within a multiplicative (1 + (cid:15) + O((cid:15)2)) factor of optimal for Problem 1.

Proof. Let L be the Laplacian that minimizes the sum of polarization and disagreement subject to
total edge weight constraint m, i.e, the solution to (5). By applying the Spielman-Srivastava algo-
rithm to L with error parameter (cid:15)(cid:48), we obtain a spectral sparsiﬁer whose combinatorial Laplacian
˜L satisﬁes for any x ∈ Rn:

(1 − (cid:15)(cid:48))xT Lx ≤ xT ˜Lx ≤ (1 + (cid:15)(cid:48))xT Lx.

(6)

8

This in turn implies,

(1 − (cid:15)(cid:48))xT (L + I)x ≤ xT ( ˜L + I)x ≤ (1 + (cid:15)(cid:48))xT (L + I)x →
1
1 + (cid:15)(cid:48) xT (L + I)−1x ≤ xT ( ˜L + I)−1x ≤
1 − (cid:15)(cid:48) xT (L + I)−1x.

By setting x = s, OP T def= sT (L + I)−1s, and using the Taylor expansion for the fraction 1
1 + (cid:15)(cid:48) + O((cid:15)(cid:48)2) when (cid:15)(cid:48) is small, we obtain that sT ( ˜L + I)−1s ≤ (cid:0)1 + (cid:15)(cid:48) + O((cid:15)(cid:48)2)(cid:1) · OP T .

1−(cid:15)(cid:48) =

Note that we may not have Tr( ˜L) = 2m. However, by (6), Tr( ˜L) ≤ (1 + (cid:15)(cid:48)) Tr(L) = (1 +
(cid:15)(cid:48))2m. Thus we can scale ˜L to have trace Tr( ˜L) = 2m and will still have sT ( ˜L + I)−1s ≤ 1
1+(cid:15)(cid:48) ·
(cid:0)1 + (cid:15)(cid:48) + O((cid:15)(cid:48)2)(cid:1) · OP T ≤ (cid:0)(1 + (cid:15) + O((cid:15)2)(cid:1) · OP T if we set (cid:15)(cid:48) = (cid:15)/2. Finally, notice that sT ( ˜L +
I)−1s ≥ sT (L + I)−1s = OP T since L is the optimizer of (5). (cid:3)

As mentioned, we use the Spielman-Srivastava sparsiﬁcation algorithm [45] in our proof since
we use it in our experiments. However, a follow-up result due to Batson-Spielman-Srivastava [3]
reduces the number of edges to linear in the number of nodes. Using the same mathematical
arguments, but invoking [3] instead of [45] we obtain the following corollary of Theorem 3.

Corollary 1 There always exists a graph with O(n/(cid:15)2) edges that achieves polarization-disagreement
index IG,s within a multiplicative (1 + (cid:15) + O((cid:15)2)) factor of the optimal for Problem 1.

3.3 Optimizing over Innate Opinions

We next give a mathematical formulation of Problem 2. We show how to simplify this formulation
to obtain a convex optimization program (speciﬁcally, an SDP) which can be solved in polynomial
time using standard algorithms [8].

Equation (7) provides a straight-forward way to model our problem. We wish to minimize the
sum of polarization and disagreement subject to the structure implied by the dynamics, and a total
budget α on the total change of innate opinions. The variable we optimize over is ds, the change
in opinions. We restrict this change to decrease the innate opinions, i.e., ds ≤ (cid:126)0.

Our main result is the following proposition.

Proposition 3 The formulation of Problem 2 in (7) is solvable in polynomial time.

Proof. We can simplify the objective of (7) using our analysis from Section 3.2. Speciﬁcally, our

problem is equivalent to

(cid:126)1T ds ≥ −α
s + ds ≥ (cid:126)0

By expanding the above objective, we observe that it is a standard quadratic form xT Qx + 2bT x + c
where Q def= (I + L)−1 is symmetric positive semideﬁnite, b = (I + L)−1s and c = sT (I + L)−1s
(note that b, c are ﬁxed with respect to the variable ds). This objective is convex, and the set of
constraints form a convex set, proving the Proposition. (cid:3)

We remark that the above convex formulation (7) can accommodate other types constraints, such as
restricting ds to be in a speciﬁc range of values, or allowing positive changes in the innate opinions.
In our experimental section, we use the basic formulation without additional constraints.

4 Experimental results

4.1 Experimental Setup

Datasets. We use two datasets collected by De et al.
[16]. Speciﬁcally, De et al. collect text
produced by users, and interactions between them [16]. The text is mapped into opinions using
NLP tools [42], and the interactions are used to create a network between users. There are many
preprocessing details, which can be found in [16]. Here, we provide a brief description of both
datasets.

Twitter is a network with n = 548 nodes, and m = 3,638 edges. Edges correspond to user
interactions. All nodes’ opinions are available to us. This dataset was collected with the aim
of analyzing the debate on Twitter about the Delhi legislative assembly elections of 2013. This
was an irresolute event with three major parties winning roughly equal shares of the vote. The
hashtags used to collect tweets were #BJP, #APP, #Congress, #Polls2013, tweeted over the period
December 9th to 15th.

Reddit is a network with n = 556 and m = 8,969 edges. There is an edge between two users
if there exist two subreddits (other than politics) that both users posted in during the given time
period. The topic of interest is politics.

Aside from the above real-world datasets, we use a wide variety of synthetic data. Since most
real-world networks have a skewed degree distributions, we focus on power law random networks
generated using the Norros-Reittu model [41], an important random graph model that produces
networks that mimic real-world networks in some respects [2, 24]. We also use skewed distributions
for generating opinions. We use the randht.m ﬁle by Aaron Clauset [10] to generate opinions
according to a power law with a given slope. We normalize opinions to the range [0, 1] by dividing
by the maximum observed value (i.e., there is always a node with opinion 1).

Machine specs. All experiments were run on a laptop with 1.7 GHz Intel Core i7 processor and
8GB of main memory.

correspond to generating innate opinions s according to a power law distribution with slopes 1.5,
2, and 2.5 respectively. For details see Section 4.2.

4.2 Experimental Findings

Synthetic experiments. Table 2 shows our results on learning optimal graph topologies (i.e.
solving Problem 1) for various innate opinion vectors averaged over 5 experiments. Each row
corresponds to sampling a vector of 100 innate opinions according to the power law distribution
with slopes 1.5, 2, and 2.5 respectively. Column L∗ shows the objective value achieved by our
optimization algorithm, and the last column shows the ˜L∗-sparsiﬁed the objective value after we
sparsify L∗ using the Spielman-Srivastava algorithm (see Theorem 3). We observe a negligible
loss, but achieve a dramatic reduction in the number of edges. The optimal solution L∗ in all
experiments corresponds to a weighted clique, i.e., there are 4950 non-zero edges. The sparsiﬁed
versions of the optimal solution have on average 761, 697, and 700 edges for the three diﬀerent
distributions on s respectively.

For comparison, in Table 2 we also show the polarization-disagreement index for several ran-
domly generated graphs. The ﬁrst column shows the results obtained by a random binomial graph,
i.e., an Erd¨os-R´enyi graph. We use p = 0.5 as the underlying edge probability. We also generate
power law networks according to the Norros-Reittu model with slopes 2, 2.5, and 3 respectively.
In general, we observe that random binomial graphs achieve a close-to-optimal performance, in
contrast to power law networks. Understanding this observation using formal random graph theory
[24] is an interesting direction for future research. We also observe empirically that the polarization-
disagreement index increases as the slope of the random network increases from 2 to 3.

Figure 1 shows our experimental ﬁndings when we optimize over innate opinions. We generate
power-law random graphs using the Norros-Reittu model with slope 2, a slope that lies close to
the slopes of several real-world networks [39]. Similarly we generate random initial opinion vectors
according to various distributions. The ﬁrst row (Figures 1(a),(b),(c),(d)) corresponds to uniform
innate opinions. The second row (Figures 1(e),(f),(g),(h)) to power law opinions with slope 2, and
the third row (Figures 1(i),(j),(k),((cid:96))) to slope 5. For the fourth row (Figures 1(m),(n),(o),(p))
we set the opinion of each node v deterministically to
u deg(u) . This setting allows us to clearly
see if the algorithm chooses to change the innate opinions of only the highest degree nodes, or
if the graph topology forces the algorithm to choose other nodes (which is actually the case).
The ﬁrst column (Figures 1(a),(e),(i),(m)) plots the degree of each node versus its innate opinion.
Figures 1(b)(f)(j),(n), and Figures 1(c),(g),(k),(o) plot the optimal change ds for each node versus
its innate opinion for budgets α = 5, and α = 20 respectively. We observe that the optimization
algorithm tends to prefer to reduce high innate opinions. However we can also observe that graph
topology plays a key role, as in certain cases it changes opinions of nodes with lower innate opinions

even if it could choose higher innate opinions. This is obvious in all ﬁgures, but most striking in
Figure 1(n); the algorithm does not modify the node with innate opinion 1 when the budget is
5, but only modiﬁes other nodes. Similar remarks can be made for the rest of the ﬁgures. This
fact is more pronounced when α = 5 than when α = 20. since as the budget α increases, the
algorithm can always reduce the values of the highest innate opinions, caring less and less about
the graph topology. Finally, Figures 1(d),(h), ((cid:96)), (p) plot the opinion vector at equilibrium after
our algorithm’s intervention (i.e, z = (I + L)−1(s + ds)), when the budget is 20. We observe that
in all cases opinions get closer, but the actual value that they concentrate around depends on the
distribution. For instance, in Figure 1(d) we observe concentration around 0.5 but in Figure 1(h)
around 0. This should not be very surprising; the average of the uniform opinion distribution is
0.5, whereas when s is distributed as a power law distribution, most of the values initially are close

12

to 0. The results presented in Figure 1 are representative observations across many experiments.

Table 3: Optimizing over graph topologies. First row, shows the objective, and the number of
edges for the Twitter and Reddit networks. Second row shows the objective and the number of

sparsiﬁed optimal solution. For details, see Section 4.2.

Real-world experiments. Table 3 summarizes our experimental results for the Twitter and
Reddit datasets. Given the Twitter network among the users, and their innate opinions, the
polarization-disagreement index IG,s is equal to 199.84. By optimizing over graph topologies, we
ﬁnd a graph G∗ with the same total weight 8,969 as the original graph that reduces the polarization-
disagreement index to 30.113. However, this optimal graph is dense; the total weight is spread
over 120,000 edges. By sparsifying using eﬀective resistances according to Spielman-Srivastava,
we obtain a sparse graph using just 3,455 edges. The polarization-disagreement index is equal to
30.114. Again, we observe that there is a negligible change in the objective value (on the order of
10−3), but there is a drastic reduction in the number of edges.

The results for Reddit are impressive; the polarization-disagreement index reduces from 199.84
to 0.0022. Both the original graph and the optimal graph have the same total weight. The weight
of the optimal graph is spread over 103,050 edges, but by sparsifying we get a graph with 7,521
edges with polarization-disagreement index 0.0022; the diﬀerence from the optimal value is < 10−5.
We checked the structure of our optimal graphs, suspecting that two clusters would emerge.
Speciﬁcally, we centered the innate vector s around the mean, and we obtained two sets of nodes:
those with innate opinions below the mean, and those with innate opinions above the mean. Intu-
itively, small disagreement graphs should have a strong community structure on these two sets of
nodes, and small polarization graphs should have a large max cut (edges across the two groups).
The optimal graphs do not exhibit such a clear two-block structure, but look closer to being ran-
dom. Combined with our ﬁnding on random binomial graphs from the synthetic experiments, it is
an interesting question whether random binomial graphs are indeed close to the optimal solution
for any initial opinion vector.

Runtime-wise, the optimization took a couple of hours for each network; observe that the total
number of variables grows as O(n2). It is an open question to come up with an eﬃcient primal-
dual procedure that takes advantage of speciﬁc features of our convex programs and Theorem 3 to
improve the overall runtime.

We also considered the problem of optimizing the vector of innate opinions using diﬀerent
budget values. We show how the equilibria opinions vectors look before and after intervention.
Figures 2(b)(c) show four opinion vectors permuted according to the sorting permutation of s
for Twitter and Reddit respectively: the vector of innate opinions s that is sorted, the original
equilibrium vector, and two optimized equilibria vectors, when the budget is 5, and 20 respectively.

We observe that nodes’ opinions converge closer and closer to the average, achieving signiﬁcantly
lower objective values as the budget increases.

5 Conclusion

Humans tend to prefer links that minimize disagreement due to the well-known conﬁrmation bias,
among other reasons. However, this may lead to polarized communities. In this work we intro-
duce the notion of the polarization-disagreement index to understand better this trade-oﬀ between
disagreement and polarization in online social networks and online social media. To the best of
our knowledge, we provide the ﬁrst formulation for ﬁnding an optimal topology which minimizes
the sum of polarization and disagreement under a popular opinion formation model. We prove
interesting facts about our objective, including the fact that there is always a graph with O(n/(cid:15)2)
edges that provides a (1 + (cid:15)) approximation to the optimal objective. We also provide eﬃcient
procedures to optimize the objective. We complement our results on optimizing graph topologies,
by considering a version of the problem where we optimize over innate opinions for a ﬁxed network.

14

Our proposed tools provide useful information about the importance of certain edges and nodes
with respect to opinion formation. We provide an extensive empirical study of our results using
synthetic data and two real-world datasets (Twitter, and Reddit).

Our work opens many interesting questions. We used the popular Friedkin-Johnsen opinion
formation model, which takes into account both consensus and disagreement in the underlying
opinion update process. The same questions we asked here can be also asked using other opinion
formation models [36]. Our experimental results strongly indicate that Erd¨os-R´enyi graphs are
not far away from achieving the optimal polarization-disagreement index IG,s. Can we prove that
Erd¨os-R´enyi graphs are always a good approximation to the optimal solution? If yes, can we prove
a similar result for expanders? Do links that cross communities always improve the polarization-
disagreement index, or not? Another interesting research direction is understanding how well
we can approximate the non-convex objective of Theorem 2, where a weighting is added to the
polarization-disagreement index. Furthermore, we focused on disagreement and polarization, two
key phenomena in human societies. Can we develop a similar framework for optimizing other
mathematical objectives for social good?
