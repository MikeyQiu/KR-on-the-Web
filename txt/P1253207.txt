ABSTRACT

Natural Language Inference (NLI) task requires an agent to determine the logical
relationship between a natural language premise and a natural language hypoth-
esis. We introduce Interactive Inference Network (IIN), a novel class of neural
network architectures that is able to achieve high-level understanding of the sen-
tence pair by hierarchically extracting semantic features from interaction space.
We show that an interaction tensor (attention weight) contains semantic informa-
tion to solve natural language inference, and a denser interaction tensor contains
richer semantic information. One instance of such architecture, Densely Interac-
tive Inference Network (DIIN), demonstrates the state-of-the-art performance on
large scale NLI copora and large-scale NLI alike corpus. It’s noteworthy that DIIN
achieve a greater than 20% error reduction on the challenging Multi-Genre NLI
(MultiNLI; Williams et al. 2017) dataset with respect to the strongest published
system.

INTRODUCTION

Natural Language Inference (NLI also known as recognizing textual entiailment, or RTE) task re-
quires one to determine whether the logical relationship between two sentences is among entailment
(if the premise is true, then the hypothesis must be true), contradiction (if the premise is true, then
the hypothesis must be false) and neutral (neither entailment nor contradiction). NLI is known as a
fundamental and yet challenging task for natural language understanding(Williams et al., 2017), not
only because it requires one to identify the language pattern, but also to understand certain common
sense knowledge. In Table 1, three samples from MultiNLI corpus show solving the task requires
one to handle the full complexity of lexical and compositional semantics. The previous work on
NLI (or RTE) has extensively researched on conventional approaches(Fyodorov et al., 2000; Bos &
Markert, 2005; MacCartney & Manning, 2009). Recent progress on NLI is enabled by the availabil-
ity of 570k human annotated dataset(Bowman et al., 2015) and the advancement of representation
learning technique.

Among the core representation learning techniques, attention mechanism is broadly applied in many
NLU tasks since its introduction: machine translation(Bahdanau et al., 2014), abstractive summa-
rization(Rush et al., 2015), Reading Comprehension(Hermann et al., 2015), dialog system(Mei et al.,
2016), etc. As described by Vaswani et al. (2017), “An attention function can be described as map-
ping a query and a set of key-value pairs to an output, where the query, keys, values, and output
are all vectors. The output is computed as a weighted sum of the values, where the weight assigned
to each value is computed by a compatibility function of the query with the corresponding key”.
Attention mechanism is known for its alignment between representations, focusing one part of rep-
resentation over another, and modeling the dependency regardless of sequence length. Observing
attention’s powerful capability, we hypothesize that the attention weight can assist with machine to
understanding the text.

A regular attention weight, the core component of the attention mechanism, encodes the cross-
sentence word relationship into a alignment matrix. However, a multi-head attention weightVaswani
et al. (2017) can encode such interaction into multiple alignment matrices, which shows a more
powerful alignment. In this work, we push the multi-head attention to a extreme by building a word-

by-word dimension-wise alignment tensor which we call interaction tensor. The interaction tensor
encodes the high-order alignment relationship between sentences pair. Our experiments demonstrate
that by capturing the rich semantic features in the interaction tensor, we are able to solve natural
language inference task well, especially in cases with paraphrase, antonyms and overlapping words.

We dub the general framework as Interactive Inference Network(IIN). To the best of our knowl-
edge, it is the ﬁrst attempt to solve natural language inference task in the interaction space. We
further explore one instance of Interactive Inference Network, Densely Interactive Inference Net-
work (DIIN), which achieves new state-of-the-art performance on both SNLI and MultiNLI copora.
To test the generality of the architecture, we interpret the paraphrase identiﬁcation task as natural
language inference task where matching as entailment, not-matching as neutral. We test the model
on Quora Question Pair dataset, which contains over 400k real world question pair, and achieves
new state-of-the-art performance.

We introduce the related work in Section 2, and discuss the general framework of IIN along with
a speciﬁc instance that enjoys state-of-the-art performance on multiple datasets in Section 3. We
describe experiments and analysis in Section 4. Finally, we conclude and discuss future work in
Section 5.

2 RELATED WORK

The early exploration on NLI mainly rely on conventional methods and small scale datasets(Marelli
et al., 2014). The availability of SNLI dataset with 570k human annotated sentence pairs has enabled
a good deal of progress on natural language understanding. The essential representation learning
techniques for NLU such as attention(Wang & Jiang, 2015), memory(Munkhdalai & Yu, 2016) and
the use of parse structure(Bowman et al., 2016; Mou et al., 2015) are studied on the SNLI which
serves as an important benchmark for sentence understanding. The models trained on NLI task
can be divided into two categories: (i) sentence encoding-based model which aims to ﬁnd vector
representation for each sentence and classiﬁes the relation by using the concatenation of two vector
representation along with their absolute element-wise difference and element-wise product(Bowman
et al., 2016; Vendrov et al., 2015; Mou et al., 2015; Liu et al., 2016; Munkhdalai & Yu, 2016).
(ii) Joint feature models which use the cross sentence feature or attention from one sentence to
another(Rockt¨aschel et al., 2015; Wang & Jiang, 2015; Cheng et al., 2016; Parikh et al., 2016; Wang
et al., 2017; Yu & Munkhdalai, 2017; Sha et al., 2016).

After neural attention mechanism is successfully applied on the machine translation task, such tech-
nique has became widely used in both natural language process and computer vision domains. Many
variants of attention technique such as hard-attention(Xu et al., 2015), self-attention(Parikh et al.,
2016), multi-hop attention(Gong & Bowman, 2017), bidirectional attention(Seo et al., 2016) and
multi-head attention(Vaswani et al., 2017) are also introduced to tackle more complicated tasks. Be-
fore this work, neural attention mechanism is mainly used to make alignment, focusing on speciﬁc
part of the representation. In this work, we want to show that attention weight contains rich semantic
information required for understanding the logical relationship between sentence pair.

Though RNN or LSTM are very good for variable length sequence modeling, using Convolutional
neural network in NLU tasks is very desirable because of its parallelism in computation. Convolu-
tional structure has been successfully applied in various domain such as machine translation(Gehring
et al., 2017), sentence classiﬁcation(Kim, 2014), text matching(Hu et al., 2014) and sentiment anal-
ysis(Kalchbrenner et al., 2014), etc. The convolution structure is also applied on different level of
granularity such as byte(Zhang & LeCun, 2017), character(Zhang et al., 2015), word(Gehring et al.,
2017) and sentences(Mou et al., 2015) levels.

INTERACTIVE INFERENCE NETWORK

The Interactive Inference Network (IIN) is a hierarchical multi-stage process and consists of ﬁve
components. Each of the components is compatible with different type of implementations. Poten-
tially all exiting approaches in machine learning, such as decision tree, support vector machine and
neural network approach, can be transfer to replace certain component in this architecture. We focus
on neural network approaches below. Figure 1 provides a visual illustration of Interactive Inference
Network.

1. Embedding Layer converts each word or phrase to a vector representation and construct
the representation matrix for sentences. In embedding layer, a model can map tokens to
vectors with the pre-trained word representation such as GloVe(Pennington et al., 2014),
word2Vec(Mikolov et al., 2013) and fasttext(Joulin et al., 2016). It can also utilize the pre-
processing tool, e.g. named entity recognizer, part-of-speech recognizer, lexical parser and
coreference identiﬁer etc., to incorporate more lexical and syntactical information into the
feature vector.

2. Encoding Layer encodes the representations by incorporating the context information or
enriching the representation with desirable features for future use. For instance, a model
can adopt bidirectional recurrent neural network to model the temporal interaction on both
direction, recursive neural network(Socher et al., 2011) (also known as TreeRNN) to model
the compositionality and the recursive structure of language, or self-attention to model the
long-term dependency on sentence. Different components of encoder can be combined to
obtain a better sentence matrix representation.

3. Interaction Layer creates an word-by-word interaction tensor by both premise and hypoth-
esis representation matrix. The interaction can be modeled in different ways. A common
approach is to compute the cosine similarity or dot product between each pair of feature
vector. On the other hand, a high-order interaction tensor can be constructed with the outer
product between two matrix representations.

4. Feature Extraction Layer adopts feature extractor to extract the semantic feature from
interaction tensor. The convolutional feature extractors, such as AlexNet(Krizhevsky et al.,
2012), VGG(Simonyan & Zisserman, 2014), Inception(Szegedy et al., 2014), ResNet(He
et al., 2016) and DenseNet(Huang et al., 2016), proven work well on image recognition
are completely compatible under such architecture. Unlike the work (Kim, 2014; Zhang
et al., 2015) who employs 1-D sliding window, our CNN architecture allows 2-D kernel
to extract semantic interaction feature from the word-by-word interaction between n-gram
pair. Sequential or tree-like feature extractors are also applicable in the feature extraction
layer.

5. Output Layer decodes the acquired features to give prediction. Under the setting of NLI,

the output layer predicts the conﬁdence on each class.

3.2 DENSELY INTERACTIVE INFERENCE NETWORK

Here we introduce Densely Interactive Inference Network (DIIN)1, which is a relatively simple
instantiation of IIN but produces state-of-the-art performance on multiple datasets.

Embedding Layer:
For DIIN, we use the concatenation of word embedding, character feature
and syntactical features. The word embedding is obtained by mapping token to high dimensional
vector space by pre-trained word vector (840B GloVe). The word embedding is updated during
training. As in (Kim et al., 2016; Lee et al., 2016), we ﬁlter character embedding with 1D convo-
lution kernel. The character convolutional feature maps are then max pooled over time dimension
for each token to obtain a vector. The character features supplies extra information for some out-of-
vocabulary (OOV) words. Syntactical features include one-hot part-of-speech (POS) tagging feature
and binary exact match (EM) feature. The EM value is activated if there are tokens with same stem
or lemma in the other sentence as the corresponding token. The EM feature is simple while found
useful as in reading comprehension task (Chen et al., 2017a). In analysis section, we study how
EM feature helps text understanding. Now we have premise representation P ∈ Rp×d and hypoth-
esis representation H ∈ Rh×d , where p refers to the sequence length of premise, h refers to the
sequence length of hypothesis and d means the dimension of both representation. The 1-D convo-
lutional neural network and character features weights share the same set of parameters between
premise and hypothesis.

In the encoding layer, the premise representation P and the hypothesis rep-
Encoding Layer:
resentation H are passed through a two-layer highway network, thus having ˆP ∈ Rp×d and

ˆH ∈ Rh×d for new premise representation and new hypothesis representation. These new rep-
resentation are then passed to self-attention layer to take into account the word order and context
information. Take premise as example, we model self-attention by

where ¯Pi is a weighted summation of ˆP . We choose α(a, b) = w(cid:62)
a [a; b; a ◦ b], where wa ∈ R3d is
a trainable weight, ◦ is element-wise multiplication, [;] is vector concatenation across row, and the
implicit multiplication is matrix multiplication. Then both ˆP and ¯P are fed into a semantic com-
posite fuse gate (fuse gate in short), which acts as a skip connection. The fuse gate is implemented
as

Aij = α( ˆPi), ˆPj ∈ R

¯Pi =

p

k=1 exp(Akj)

(cid:80)p

ˆPj,

∀i, j ∈ [1, ..., p]

zi = tanh(W 1(cid:62)[ ˆPi; ¯Pi] + b1)
ri = σ(W 2(cid:62)[ ˆPi; ¯Pi] + b2)
fi = σ(W 3(cid:62)[ ˆPi; ¯Pi] + b3)
˜Pi = ri ◦ ˆPi + fi ◦ zi

(6)

where W 1, W 2, W 3 ∈ R2d×d and b1 b2, b3 ∈ Rd are trainable weights, σ is sigmoid nonlinear
operation.
We do the same operation on hypothesis representation, thus having ˜H. The weights of intra-
attention and fuse gate for premise and hypothesis are not shared, but the difference between the
weights of are penalized. The penalization aims to ensure the parallel structure learns the similar
functionality but is aware of the subtle semantic difference between premise and hypothesis.

Interaction Layer:
sentation P enc and hypothesis encoded representation H enc as follows:

The interaction layer models the interaction between premise encoded repre-

Iij = β( ˜Pi, ˜Hj) ∈ Rd, ∀i ∈ [1, ..., p], ∀j ∈ [1, ..., h]

(7)

where ˜Pi is the i-th row vector of ˜P , and ˜Hj is the j-th row vector of ˜H. Though there are many
implementations of interaction, we ﬁnd β(a, b) = a ◦ b very useful.

Feature Extraction Layer: We adopt DenseNet(Huang et al., 2016) as convolutional feature ex-
tractor in DIIN. Though our experiments show ResNet(He et al., 2016) works well in the architec-
ture, we choose DenseNet because it is effective in saving parameters. One interesting observation
with ResNet is that if we remove the skip connection in residual structure, the model does not con-
verge at all. We found batch normalization delays convergence without contributing to accuracy,
therefore we does not use it in our case. A ReLU activation function is applied after all convolution
unless otherwise noted. Once we have the interaction tensor I, we use a convolution with 1 × 1
kernel to scale down the tensor in a ratio, η, without following ReLU. If the input channel is k then
the output channel is f loor(k × η). Then the generated feature map is feed into three sets of Dense
block(Huang et al., 2016) and transition block pair. The DenseNet block contains n layers of 3 × 3
convolution layer with growth rate of g. The transition layer has a convolution layer with 1 × 1
kernel for scaling down purpose, followed by a max pooling layer with stride 2. The transition scale
down ratio in transition layer is θ.

Output Layer: DIIN uses a linear layer to classify ﬁnal ﬂattened feature representation to three
classes.

In this section, we present the evaluation of our model. We ﬁrst perform quantitative evaluation,
comparing our model with other competitive models. We then conduct some qualitative analyses to
understand how DIIN achieve the high level understanding through interaction.

4 EXPERIMENTS

4.1 DATA

Here we introduce three datasets we evaluate our model on. The evaluation metric for all dataset is
accuracy.

SNLI Stanford Natural Language Inference (SNLI; Bowman et al. 2015) has 570k human anno-
tated sentence pairs. The premise data is draw from the captions of the Flickr30k corpus, and the
hypothesis data is manually composed. The labels provided in are “entailment”, “neutral’, “contra-
diction” and “-”. “-” shows that annotators cannot reach consensus with each other, thus removed
during training and testing as in other works. We use the same data split as in Bowman et al. (2015).

MultiNLI Multi-Genre NLI Corpus (MultiNLI; Williams et al. 2017) has 433k sentence pairs,
whose collection process and task detail are modeled closely to SNLI. The premise data is col-
lected from maximally broad range of genre of American English such as written non-ﬁction genres
(SLATE, OUP, GOVERNMENT, VERBATIM, TRAVEL), spoken genres (TELEPHONE, FACE-
TO-FACE), less formal written genres (FICTION, LETTERS) and a specialized one for 9/11. Half
of these selected genres appear in training set while the rest are not, creating in-domain (matched)
and cross-domain (mismatched) development/test sets. We use the same data split as provided by
Williams et al. (2017). Since test set labels are not provided, the test performance is obtained through
submission on Kaggle.com2. Each team is limited to two submissions per day.

Quora question pair Quora question pair dataset contains over 400k real world question pair
selected from Quora.com. A binary annotation which stands for match (duplicate) or not match (not
duplicate) is provided for each question pair. In our case, duplicate question pair can be interpreted
as entailment relation and not duplicate as neutral. We use the same split ratio as mentioned in
(Wang et al., 2017).

4.2 EXPERIMENTS SETTING

We implement our algorithm with Tensorﬂow(Abadi et al., 2016) framework. An Adadelta opti-
mizer(Zeiler, 2012) with ρ as 0.95 and (cid:15) as 1e−8 is used to optimize all the trainable weights. The
initial learning rate is set to 0.5 and batch size to 70. When the model does not improve best in-
domain performance for 30,000 steps, an SGD optimizer with learning rate of 3e−4 is used to help
model to ﬁnd a better local optimum. Dropout layers are applied before all linear layers and after
word-embedding layer. We use an exponential decayed keep rate during training, where the initial
keep rate is 1.0 and the decay rate is 0.977 for every 10,000 step. We initialize our word embeddings
with pre-trained 300D GloVe 840B vectors Pennington et al. (2014) while the out-of-vocabulary
word are randomly initialized with uniform distribution. The character embeddings are randomly
initialized with 100D. We crop or pad each token to have 16 characters. The 1D convolution ker-
nel size for character embedding is 5. All weights are constraint by L2 regularization, and the L2
regularization at step t is calculated as follows:

L2Ratiot = σ(

(t − L2F ullStep/2) × 8
L2F ullStep/2

) × L2F ullRatio

(8)

where L2F ullRatio determines the maximum L2 regularization ratio, and L2F ullStep determines
at which step the maximum L2 regularization ratio would be applied on the L2 regularization. We
choose L2F ullRatio as 0.9e − 5 and L2F ullStep as 100,000. The ratio of L2 penalty between the

difference of two encoder weights is set to 1e − 3. For a dense block in feature extraction layer, the
number of layer n is set to 8 and growth rate g is set to 20. The ﬁrst scale down ratio η in feature
extraction layer is set to 0.3 and transitional scale down ratio θ is set to 0.5. The sequence length
is set as a hard cutoff on all experiments: 48 for MultiNLI, 32 for SNLI and 24 for Quora Question
Pair Dataset. During the experiments on MultiNLI, we use 15% of data from SNLI as in Williams
et al. (2017). We select the parameter by the best run of development accuracy. Our ensembling
approach considers the majority vote of the predictions given by multiple runs of the same model
under different random parameter initialization.

4.3 EXPERIMENT ON MULTINLI

We compare our result with all other published systems in Table 2. Besides ESIM, the state-of-the-
art model on SNLI, all other models appear at RepEval 2017 workshop. RepEval 2017 workshop
requires all submitted model to be sentence encoding-based model therefore alignment between sen-
tences and memory module are not eligible for competition. All models except ours share one com-
mon feature that they use LSTM as a essential building block as encoder. Our approach, without
using any recurrent structure, achieves the new state-of-the-art performance of 80.0%, exceeding
current state-of-the-art performance by more than 5%. Unlike the observation from Nangia et al.
(2017), we ﬁnd the out-of-domain test performance is consistently lower than in-domain test perfor-
mance. Selecting parameters from the best in-domain development accuracy partially contributes to
this result.

4.4 EXPERIMENT ON SNLI

In Table 3, we compare our model to other model performance on SNLI. Experiments (2-7) are
sentence encoding based model. Bowman et al. (2016) provides a BiLSTM baseline. Vendrov
et al. (2015) adopts two layer GRU encoder with pre-trained ”skip-thoughts” vectors. To capture
sentence-level semantics, Mou et al. (2015) use tree-based CNN and Bowman et al. (2016) propose
a stack-augmented parser-interpreter neural network (SPINN) which incorporates parsing informa-
tion in a sequential manner. Liu et al. (2016) uses intra-attention on top of BiLSTM to generate sen-
tence representation, and Munkhdalai & Yu (2016) proposes an memory augmented neural network
to encode the sentence. The next group of model, experiments (8-18), uses cross sentence feature.
Rockt¨aschel et al. (2015) aligns each sentence word-by-word with attention on top of LSTMs. Wang
& Jiang (2015) enforces cross sentence attention word-by-word matching with the proprosed mL-
STM model. Cheng et al. (2016) proposes long short-term memory-network(LSTMN) with deep
attention fusion that links the current word to previous word stored in memory. Parikh et al. (2016)
decomposes the task into sub-problems and conquer them respectively. Yu & Munkhdalai (2017)
proposes neural tree indexer, a full n-ary tree whose subtrees can be overlapped. Re-read LSTM
proposed by Sha et al. (2016) considers the attention vector of one sentence as the inner-state of
LSTM for another sentence. Chen et al. (2016) propose a sequential model that infers locally, and a
ensemble with tree-like inference module that further improves performance. We show our model,
DIIN, achieves state-of-the-art performance on the competitive leaderboard.

4.5 EXPERIMENT ON QUORA QUESTION PAIR DATASET

In this subsection, we evaluate the effectiveness of our model for paraphrase identiﬁcation as nat-
ural language inference task. Other than our baselines, we compare with Wang et al. (2017) and
Tomar et al. (2017). BIMPM models different perspective of matching between sentence pair on
both direction, then aggregates matching vector with LSTM. DECATTword and DECATTchar uses
automatically collected in-domain paraphrase data to noisy pretrain n-gram word embedding and n-
gram subword embedding correspondingly on decomposable attention model proposed by (Parikh
et al., 2016). In Table 4, our experiment shows DIIN has better performance than all other models
and an ensemble score is higher than the former best result for more than 1 percent.

4.6 ANALYSIS

Ablation Study We conduct a ablation study on our base model to examine the effectiveness of
each component. We study our model on MultiNLI dataset and we use Matched validation score
as the standard for model selection. The result is shown in Table 5. We studies how EM feature

contributes to the system. After removing the exact match binary feature, we ﬁnd the performance
degrade to 78.2 on matched score on development set and 78.0 on mismatched score. As observed in
reading comprehension task Chen et al. (2017a), the simple exact match feature does help the model
to better understand the sentences. In the experiment 3, we remove the convolutional feature extrac-
tor and then model is structured as a sentence-encoding based model. The sentence representation
matrix is max-pooled over time to obtain a feature vector. Once we have the feature vector p for
premise and h for hypothesis, we use [p; h; |p − h|; p ◦ h] as ﬁnal feature vector to classify the rela-
tionship. We obtain 73.2 for matched score and 73.6 on mismatched data. The result is competitive
among other sentence-encoding based model. We further study how encoding layer contribute in
enriching the feature space in interaction tensor. If we remove encoding layer completely, then we’ll
obtain a 73.5 for matched score and 73.2 for mismatched score. The result demonstrate the feature
extraction layer have powerful capability to capture the semantic feature. In experiment 5, we re-
move both self-attention and fuse gate, thus retaining only highway network. The result improves to
77.7 and 77.3 respectively on matched and mismatched development set. However, in experiment
6, when we only remove fuse gate, to our surprise, the performance degrade to 73.5 for matched
score and 73.8 for mismatched. On the other hand, if we use the addition of the representation after
highway network and the representation after self-attention as skip connection as in experiment 7,
the performance increase to 77.3 and 76.3. The comparison indicates self-attention layer makes the
training harder to converge while a skip connection could ease the gradient ﬂow for both highway
layer and self-attention layer. By comparing the base model and the model the in experiment 6, we
show that the fuse gate not only well serves as a skip connection, but also makes good decision upon
which information the fuse for both representation. To show that dense interaction tensor contains
more semantic information, we replace the dense interaction tensor with dot product similarity ma-
trix between the encoded representation of premise and hypothesis. The result shows that the dot
product similarity matrix has an inferior capacity of semantic information. Another dimensionality
study is provided in supplementary material. In experiment 9, we share the encoding layer weight,
and the result decrease from the baseline. The result shows that the two set of encoding weights
learn the subtle difference between premise and hypothesis.

Error analysis To analyze the model prediction, we use annotated subset of development set
provided by Williams et al. (2017) that consists of 1,000 examples each tagged with zero or more
following tags:

• CONDITIONAL: whether the sentence contains a conditional.
• WORD OVERLAP: whether both sentences share more than 70% of their tokens.
• NEGATION: whether a negation shows up in either sentence.
• ANTO: whether two sentences contain antonym pair.
• LONG SENTENCE: whether premise or hypothesis is longer than 30 or 16 tokens respec-

tively.

• TENSE DIFFERENCE: whether any verb in two sentences uses different tense.
• ACTIVE/PASSIVE: whether there is an active-to-passive (or vice versa) transformation

from the premise to the hypothesis.

For more detailed descriptions, please resort to Williams et al. (2017). The result is shown in Table
6. We ﬁnd DIIN is consistently better on sentence pair with WORD OVERLAP, ANTO, LONG
SENTENCE, PARAPHRASE and BELIEF tags by a large margin. During investigation, we hy-
pothesize exact match feature helps the model to better understand paraphrase, therefore we study
the result from second ablation ablation study where exact match feature is not used. Surprisingly,
the model without exact model feature does not work worse on PARAPHRASE, instead, the accu-
racy on ANTO drops about 10%. DIIN is also work well on LONG SENTENCE, partially because
the receptive ﬁeld is large enough to cover all tokens.

Visualization We also visualize the hidden representation from interaction tensor I and the feature
map from ﬁrst dense block in Figure 2. We pick a sentence pair whose premise is “South Carolina
has no referendum right, so the Supreme Court canceled the vote and upheld the ban.” and hypothe-
sis is “South Carolina has a referendum right, so the Supreme Court was powerless over the state.”.
The upper row of ﬁgures are sampled from hidden representation of interaction tensor I. We observe
the values of neurons are highly correlated row-wise and column-wise in the interaction tensor I and
different channel of hidden representation shows different aspect of interaction. Though in certain
channel same words, “referendum”, or phrases, “supreme court”, cause activation, different word or
phrase pair, such as “ban” and “powerless over”, also cause activation in other activation. It shows
the model’s strong capacity of understanding text in different perspective. The lower row of Figure
2 shows the feature map from ﬁrst dense block. After being convolved from the interaction tensor

and previous feature map, new feature maps shows activation in different position, demonstrating
different semantic features are found. The ﬁrst ﬁgure in the lower row has similar pattern as normal
attention weight whereas others has no obvious pattern. Different channels of feature maps indicate
different kinds of semantic feature.

Figure 2: A visualization of hidden representation. The premise is “South Carolina has no refer-
endum right, so the Supreme Court canceled the vote and upheld the ban.” and the hypothesis is
“South Carolina has a referendum right, so the Supreme Court was powerless over the state.”. The
upper row are sampled from interaction tensor I and the lower row are sample from the feature map
of ﬁrst dense block. We use viridis colormap, where yellow represents activation and purple shows
the neuron is not active.

5 CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK

We show the interaction tensor (or attention weight) contains semantic information to understand
the natural language. We introduce Interactive Inference Network, a novel class of architecture that
allows the model to solve NLI or NLI alike tasks via extracting semantic feature from interaction
tensor end-to-end. One instance of such architecture, Densely Interactive Inference Network (DIIN),
achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple datasets. By ablating each component in DIIN and
changing the dimensionality, we show the effectiveness of each component in DIIN.

Though we have the initial exploration of natural language inference in interaction space, the full
potential is not yet clear. We will keep exploring the potential of interaction space. Incorporating
common-sense knowledge from external resources such as knowledge base to leverage the capacity
of the mode is another research goal of ours.

We thank Yuchen Lu, Chang Huang and Kai Yu for their sincere and insightful advice.

A SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIAL

Dimensionality and Parameter number study To study the inﬂuence of the model dimension d
which is also the channel number of interaction tensor, we design experiments to ﬁnd out whether
dimension has inﬂuence on performance. We also present the parameter count of these models.
The dimensionality is 448 where 300 comes from word embedding, 100 comes from char feature,
47 comes from Part of speech tagging and 1 comes from the binary exact match feature. Since
Highway network sets the output dimensionality default as that in input, we design a variant to
highway network so that different output size could be obtained. The variant of highway layer is
designed as follows:

t xi + bt)

g xi + bg)

ti = tanh(W (cid:62)
gi = σ(W (cid:62)
(cid:26)xi

x(cid:48)

i =

W (cid:62)

x xi + bx
oi = gi ◦ ti + (1 − gi) ◦ x(cid:48)
i

din = dout
din (cid:54)= dout

(9)

(10)

(11)

(12)

where xi is the i-th vector of input matrix x, oi is the i-th vector of output matrix o, W (cid:62)
W (cid:62)

x ∈ Rdin×dout and bt, bg, bx ∈ Rdout are trainable weights.

t , W (cid:62)
g ,

The result shows that higher dimension number have better performance when the dimension num-
ber is lower certain threshold, however, when the number of dimensionality is greater than the
threshold, larger number of parameter and higher dimensionality doesn’t contribute to performance.
In the case of SNLI, due to its simplicity in language pattern, 250D would be sufﬁce to obtain a
good performance. On the other hand, it requires 350D to achieve a competitive performance on
MultiNLI. We fail to reproduce our best performance with the new structure on MultiNLI. It shows
that the additional layer on highway network doesn’t helps convergence.

ABSTRACT

Natural Language Inference (NLI) task requires an agent to determine the logical
relationship between a natural language premise and a natural language hypoth-
esis. We introduce Interactive Inference Network (IIN), a novel class of neural
network architectures that is able to achieve high-level understanding of the sen-
tence pair by hierarchically extracting semantic features from interaction space.
We show that an interaction tensor (attention weight) contains semantic informa-
tion to solve natural language inference, and a denser interaction tensor contains
richer semantic information. One instance of such architecture, Densely Interac-
tive Inference Network (DIIN), demonstrates the state-of-the-art performance on
large scale NLI copora and large-scale NLI alike corpus. It’s noteworthy that DIIN
achieve a greater than 20% error reduction on the challenging Multi-Genre NLI
(MultiNLI; Williams et al. 2017) dataset with respect to the strongest published
system.

INTRODUCTION

Natural Language Inference (NLI also known as recognizing textual entiailment, or RTE) task re-
quires one to determine whether the logical relationship between two sentences is among entailment
(if the premise is true, then the hypothesis must be true), contradiction (if the premise is true, then
the hypothesis must be false) and neutral (neither entailment nor contradiction). NLI is known as a
fundamental and yet challenging task for natural language understanding(Williams et al., 2017), not
only because it requires one to identify the language pattern, but also to understand certain common
sense knowledge. In Table 1, three samples from MultiNLI corpus show solving the task requires
one to handle the full complexity of lexical and compositional semantics. The previous work on
NLI (or RTE) has extensively researched on conventional approaches(Fyodorov et al., 2000; Bos &
Markert, 2005; MacCartney & Manning, 2009). Recent progress on NLI is enabled by the availabil-
ity of 570k human annotated dataset(Bowman et al., 2015) and the advancement of representation
learning technique.

Among the core representation learning techniques, attention mechanism is broadly applied in many
NLU tasks since its introduction: machine translation(Bahdanau et al., 2014), abstractive summa-
rization(Rush et al., 2015), Reading Comprehension(Hermann et al., 2015), dialog system(Mei et al.,
2016), etc. As described by Vaswani et al. (2017), “An attention function can be described as map-
ping a query and a set of key-value pairs to an output, where the query, keys, values, and output
are all vectors. The output is computed as a weighted sum of the values, where the weight assigned
to each value is computed by a compatibility function of the query with the corresponding key”.
Attention mechanism is known for its alignment between representations, focusing one part of rep-
resentation over another, and modeling the dependency regardless of sequence length. Observing
attention’s powerful capability, we hypothesize that the attention weight can assist with machine to
understanding the text.

A regular attention weight, the core component of the attention mechanism, encodes the cross-
sentence word relationship into a alignment matrix. However, a multi-head attention weightVaswani
et al. (2017) can encode such interaction into multiple alignment matrices, which shows a more
powerful alignment. In this work, we push the multi-head attention to a extreme by building a word-

by-word dimension-wise alignment tensor which we call interaction tensor. The interaction tensor
encodes the high-order alignment relationship between sentences pair. Our experiments demonstrate
that by capturing the rich semantic features in the interaction tensor, we are able to solve natural
language inference task well, especially in cases with paraphrase, antonyms and overlapping words.

We dub the general framework as Interactive Inference Network(IIN). To the best of our knowl-
edge, it is the ﬁrst attempt to solve natural language inference task in the interaction space. We
further explore one instance of Interactive Inference Network, Densely Interactive Inference Net-
work (DIIN), which achieves new state-of-the-art performance on both SNLI and MultiNLI copora.
To test the generality of the architecture, we interpret the paraphrase identiﬁcation task as natural
language inference task where matching as entailment, not-matching as neutral. We test the model
on Quora Question Pair dataset, which contains over 400k real world question pair, and achieves
new state-of-the-art performance.

We introduce the related work in Section 2, and discuss the general framework of IIN along with
a speciﬁc instance that enjoys state-of-the-art performance on multiple datasets in Section 3. We
describe experiments and analysis in Section 4. Finally, we conclude and discuss future work in

The early exploration on NLI mainly rely on conventional methods and small scale datasets(Marelli
et al., 2014). The availability of SNLI dataset with 570k human annotated sentence pairs has enabled
a good deal of progress on natural language understanding. The essential representation learning
techniques for NLU such as attention(Wang & Jiang, 2015), memory(Munkhdalai & Yu, 2016) and
the use of parse structure(Bowman et al., 2016; Mou et al., 2015) are studied on the SNLI which
serves as an important benchmark for sentence understanding. The models trained on NLI task
can be divided into two categories: (i) sentence encoding-based model which aims to ﬁnd vector
representation for each sentence and classiﬁes the relation by using the concatenation of two vector
representation along with their absolute element-wise difference and element-wise product(Bowman
et al., 2016; Vendrov et al., 2015; Mou et al., 2015; Liu et al., 2016; Munkhdalai & Yu, 2016).
(ii) Joint feature models which use the cross sentence feature or attention from one sentence to
another(Rockt¨aschel et al., 2015; Wang & Jiang, 2015; Cheng et al., 2016; Parikh et al., 2016; Wang
et al., 2017; Yu & Munkhdalai, 2017; Sha et al., 2016).

After neural attention mechanism is successfully applied on the machine translation task, such tech-
nique has became widely used in both natural language process and computer vision domains. Many
variants of attention technique such as hard-attention(Xu et al., 2015), self-attention(Parikh et al.,
2016), multi-hop attention(Gong & Bowman, 2017), bidirectional attention(Seo et al., 2016) and
multi-head attention(Vaswani et al., 2017) are also introduced to tackle more complicated tasks. Be-
fore this work, neural attention mechanism is mainly used to make alignment, focusing on speciﬁc
part of the representation. In this work, we want to show that attention weight contains rich semantic
information required for understanding the logical relationship between sentence pair.

Though RNN or LSTM are very good for variable length sequence modeling, using Convolutional
neural network in NLU tasks is very desirable because of its parallelism in computation. Convolu-
tional structure has been successfully applied in various domain such as machine translation(Gehring
et al., 2017), sentence classiﬁcation(Kim, 2014), text matching(Hu et al., 2014) and sentiment anal-
ysis(Kalchbrenner et al., 2014), etc. The convolution structure is also applied on different level of
granularity such as byte(Zhang & LeCun, 2017), character(Zhang et al., 2015), word(Gehring et al.,
2017) and sentences(Mou et al., 2015) levels.

INTERACTIVE INFERENCE NETWORK

The Interactive Inference Network (IIN) is a hierarchical multi-stage process and consists of ﬁve
components. Each of the components is compatible with different type of implementations. Poten-
tially all exiting approaches in machine learning, such as decision tree, support vector machine and
neural network approach, can be transfer to replace certain component in this architecture. We focus
on neural network approaches below. Figure 1 provides a visual illustration of Interactive Inference
Network.

1. Embedding Layer converts each word or phrase to a vector representation and construct
the representation matrix for sentences. In embedding layer, a model can map tokens to
vectors with the pre-trained word representation such as GloVe(Pennington et al., 2014),
word2Vec(Mikolov et al., 2013) and fasttext(Joulin et al., 2016). It can also utilize the pre-
processing tool, e.g. named entity recognizer, part-of-speech recognizer, lexical parser and
coreference identiﬁer etc., to incorporate more lexical and syntactical information into the
feature vector.

2. Encoding Layer encodes the representations by incorporating the context information or
enriching the representation with desirable features for future use. For instance, a model
can adopt bidirectional recurrent neural network to model the temporal interaction on both
direction, recursive neural network(Socher et al., 2011) (also known as TreeRNN) to model
the compositionality and the recursive structure of language, or self-attention to model the
long-term dependency on sentence. Different components of encoder can be combined to
obtain a better sentence matrix representation.

3. Interaction Layer creates an word-by-word interaction tensor by both premise and hypoth-
esis representation matrix. The interaction can be modeled in different ways. A common
approach is to compute the cosine similarity or dot product between each pair of feature
vector. On the other hand, a high-order interaction tensor can be constructed with the outer
product between two matrix representations.

4. Feature Extraction Layer adopts feature extractor to extract the semantic feature from
interaction tensor. The convolutional feature extractors, such as AlexNet(Krizhevsky et al.,
2012), VGG(Simonyan & Zisserman, 2014), Inception(Szegedy et al., 2014), ResNet(He
et al., 2016) and DenseNet(Huang et al., 2016), proven work well on image recognition
are completely compatible under such architecture. Unlike the work (Kim, 2014; Zhang
et al., 2015) who employs 1-D sliding window, our CNN architecture allows 2-D kernel
to extract semantic interaction feature from the word-by-word interaction between n-gram
pair. Sequential or tree-like feature extractors are also applicable in the feature extraction
layer.

5. Output Layer decodes the acquired features to give prediction. Under the setting of NLI,

the output layer predicts the conﬁdence on each class.

3.2 DENSELY INTERACTIVE INFERENCE NETWORK

Here we introduce Densely Interactive Inference Network (DIIN)1, which is a relatively simple
instantiation of IIN but produces state-of-the-art performance on multiple datasets.

Embedding Layer:
For DIIN, we use the concatenation of word embedding, character feature
and syntactical features. The word embedding is obtained by mapping token to high dimensional
vector space by pre-trained word vector (840B GloVe). The word embedding is updated during
training. As in (Kim et al., 2016; Lee et al., 2016), we ﬁlter character embedding with 1D convo-
lution kernel. The character convolutional feature maps are then max pooled over time dimension
for each token to obtain a vector. The character features supplies extra information for some out-of-
vocabulary (OOV) words. Syntactical features include one-hot part-of-speech (POS) tagging feature
and binary exact match (EM) feature. The EM value is activated if there are tokens with same stem
or lemma in the other sentence as the corresponding token. The EM feature is simple while found
useful as in reading comprehension task (Chen et al., 2017a). In analysis section, we study how
EM feature helps text understanding. Now we have premise representation P ∈ Rp×d and hypoth-
esis representation H ∈ Rh×d , where p refers to the sequence length of premise, h refers to the
sequence length of hypothesis and d means the dimension of both representation. The 1-D convo-
lutional neural network and character features weights share the same set of parameters between
premise and hypothesis.

In the encoding layer, the premise representation P and the hypothesis rep-
Encoding Layer:
resentation H are passed through a two-layer highway network, thus having ˆP ∈ Rp×d and

Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2018

ˆH ∈ Rh×d for new premise representation and new hypothesis representation. These new rep-
resentation are then passed to self-attention layer to take into account the word order and context
information. Take premise as example, we model self-attention by

where ¯Pi is a weighted summation of ˆP . We choose α(a, b) = w(cid:62)
a [a; b; a ◦ b], where wa ∈ R3d is
a trainable weight, ◦ is element-wise multiplication, [;] is vector concatenation across row, and the
implicit multiplication is matrix multiplication. Then both ˆP and ¯P are fed into a semantic com-
posite fuse gate (fuse gate in short), which acts as a skip connection. The fuse gate is implemented
as

Aij = α( ˆPi), ˆPj ∈ R

¯Pi =

p
(cid:88)

k=1 exp(Akj)

(cid:80)p

ˆPj,

∀i, j ∈ [1, ..., p]

zi = tanh(W 1(cid:62)[ ˆPi; ¯Pi] + b1)
ri = σ(W 2(cid:62)[ ˆPi; ¯Pi] + b2)
fi = σ(W 3(cid:62)[ ˆPi; ¯Pi] + b3)
˜Pi = ri ◦ ˆPi + fi ◦ zi

(6)

where W 1, W 2, W 3 ∈ R2d×d and b1 b2, b3 ∈ Rd are trainable weights, σ is sigmoid nonlinear
operation.
We do the same operation on hypothesis representation, thus having ˜H. The weights of intra-
attention and fuse gate for premise and hypothesis are not shared, but the difference between the
weights of are penalized. The penalization aims to ensure the parallel structure learns the similar
functionality but is aware of the subtle semantic difference between premise and hypothesis.

Interaction Layer:
sentation P enc and hypothesis encoded representation H enc as follows:

The interaction layer models the interaction between premise encoded repre-

Iij = β( ˜Pi, ˜Hj) ∈ Rd, ∀i ∈ [1, ..., p], ∀j ∈ [1, ..., h]

(7)

where ˜Pi is the i-th row vector of ˜P , and ˜Hj is the j-th row vector of ˜H. Though there are many
implementations of interaction, we ﬁnd β(a, b) = a ◦ b very useful.

Feature Extraction Layer: We adopt DenseNet(Huang et al., 2016) as convolutional feature ex-
tractor in DIIN. Though our experiments show ResNet(He et al., 2016) works well in the architec-
ture, we choose DenseNet because it is effective in saving parameters. One interesting observation
with ResNet is that if we remove the skip connection in residual structure, the model does not con-
verge at all. We found batch normalization delays convergence without contributing to accuracy,
therefore we does not use it in our case. A ReLU activation function is applied after all convolution
unless otherwise noted. Once we have the interaction tensor I, we use a convolution with 1 × 1
kernel to scale down the tensor in a ratio, η, without following ReLU. If the input channel is k then
the output channel is f loor(k × η). Then the generated feature map is feed into three sets of Dense
block(Huang et al., 2016) and transition block pair. The DenseNet block contains n layers of 3 × 3
convolution layer with growth rate of g. The transition layer has a convolution layer with 1 × 1
kernel for scaling down purpose, followed by a max pooling layer with stride 2. The transition scale
down ratio in transition layer is θ.

Output Layer: DIIN uses a linear layer to classify ﬁnal ﬂattened feature representation to three
classes.

In this section, we present the evaluation of our model. We ﬁrst perform quantitative evaluation,
comparing our model with other competitive models. We then conduct some qualitative analyses to
understand how DIIN achieve the high level understanding through interaction.

4 EXPERIMENTS

4.1 DATA

Here we introduce three datasets we evaluate our model on. The evaluation metric for all dataset is
accuracy.

SNLI Stanford Natural Language Inference (SNLI; Bowman et al. 2015) has 570k human anno-
tated sentence pairs. The premise data is draw from the captions of the Flickr30k corpus, and the
hypothesis data is manually composed. The labels provided in are “entailment”, “neutral’, “contra-
diction” and “-”. “-” shows that annotators cannot reach consensus with each other, thus removed
during training and testing as in other works. We use the same data split as in Bowman et al. (2015).

MultiNLI Multi-Genre NLI Corpus (MultiNLI; Williams et al. 2017) has 433k sentence pairs,
whose collection process and task detail are modeled closely to SNLI. The premise data is col-
lected from maximally broad range of genre of American English such as written non-ﬁction genres
(SLATE, OUP, GOVERNMENT, VERBATIM, TRAVEL), spoken genres (TELEPHONE, FACE-
TO-FACE), less formal written genres (FICTION, LETTERS) and a specialized one for 9/11. Half
of these selected genres appear in training set while the rest are not, creating in-domain (matched)
and cross-domain (mismatched) development/test sets. We use the same data split as provided by
Williams et al. (2017). Since test set labels are not provided, the test performance is obtained through
submission on Kaggle.com2. Each team is limited to two submissions per day.

Quora question pair Quora question pair dataset contains over 400k real world question pair
selected from Quora.com. A binary annotation which stands for match (duplicate) or not match (not
duplicate) is provided for each question pair. In our case, duplicate question pair can be interpreted
as entailment relation and not duplicate as neutral. We use the same split ratio as mentioned in
(Wang et al., 2017).

4.2 EXPERIMENTS SETTING

We implement our algorithm with Tensorﬂow(Abadi et al., 2016) framework. An Adadelta opti-
mizer(Zeiler, 2012) with ρ as 0.95 and (cid:15) as 1e−8 is used to optimize all the trainable weights. The
initial learning rate is set to 0.5 and batch size to 70. When the model does not improve best in-
domain performance for 30,000 steps, an SGD optimizer with learning rate of 3e−4 is used to help
model to ﬁnd a better local optimum. Dropout layers are applied before all linear layers and after
word-embedding layer. We use an exponential decayed keep rate during training, where the initial
keep rate is 1.0 and the decay rate is 0.977 for every 10,000 step. We initialize our word embeddings
with pre-trained 300D GloVe 840B vectors Pennington et al. (2014) while the out-of-vocabulary
word are randomly initialized with uniform distribution. The character embeddings are randomly
initialized with 100D. We crop or pad each token to have 16 characters. The 1D convolution ker-
nel size for character embedding is 5. All weights are constraint by L2 regularization, and the L2
regularization at step t is calculated as follows:

L2Ratiot = σ(

(t − L2F ullStep/2) × 8
L2F ullStep/2

) × L2F ullRatio

(8)

where L2F ullRatio determines the maximum L2 regularization ratio, and L2F ullStep determines
at which step the maximum L2 regularization ratio would be applied on the L2 regularization. We
choose L2F ullRatio as 0.9e − 5 and L2F ullStep as 100,000. The ratio of L2 penalty between the

difference of two encoder weights is set to 1e − 3. For a dense block in feature extraction layer, the
number of layer n is set to 8 and growth rate g is set to 20. The ﬁrst scale down ratio η in feature
extraction layer is set to 0.3 and transitional scale down ratio θ is set to 0.5. The sequence length
is set as a hard cutoff on all experiments: 48 for MultiNLI, 32 for SNLI and 24 for Quora Question
Pair Dataset. During the experiments on MultiNLI, we use 15% of data from SNLI as in Williams
et al. (2017). We select the parameter by the best run of development accuracy. Our ensembling
approach considers the majority vote of the predictions given by multiple runs of the same model
under different random parameter initialization.

4.3 EXPERIMENT ON MULTINLI

We compare our result with all other published systems in Table 2. Besides ESIM, the state-of-the-
art model on SNLI, all other models appear at RepEval 2017 workshop. RepEval 2017 workshop
requires all submitted model to be sentence encoding-based model therefore alignment between sen-
tences and memory module are not eligible for competition. All models except ours share one com-
mon feature that they use LSTM as a essential building block as encoder. Our approach, without
using any recurrent structure, achieves the new state-of-the-art performance of 80.0%, exceeding
current state-of-the-art performance by more than 5%. Unlike the observation from Nangia et al.
(2017), we ﬁnd the out-of-domain test performance is consistently lower than in-domain test perfor-
mance. Selecting parameters from the best in-domain development accuracy partially contributes to
this result.

4.4 EXPERIMENT ON SNLI

In Table 3, we compare our model to other model performance on SNLI. Experiments (2-7) are
sentence encoding based model. Bowman et al. (2016) provides a BiLSTM baseline. Vendrov
et al. (2015) adopts two layer GRU encoder with pre-trained ”skip-thoughts” vectors. To capture
sentence-level semantics, Mou et al. (2015) use tree-based CNN and Bowman et al. (2016) propose
a stack-augmented parser-interpreter neural network (SPINN) which incorporates parsing informa-
tion in a sequential manner. Liu et al. (2016) uses intra-attention on top of BiLSTM to generate sen-
tence representation, and Munkhdalai & Yu (2016) proposes an memory augmented neural network
to encode the sentence. The next group of model, experiments (8-18), uses cross sentence feature.
Rockt¨aschel et al. (2015) aligns each sentence word-by-word with attention on top of LSTMs. Wang
& Jiang (2015) enforces cross sentence attention word-by-word matching with the proprosed mL-
STM model. Cheng et al. (2016) proposes long short-term memory-network(LSTMN) with deep
attention fusion that links the current word to previous word stored in memory. Parikh et al. (2016)
decomposes the task into sub-problems and conquer them respectively. Yu & Munkhdalai (2017)
proposes neural tree indexer, a full n-ary tree whose subtrees can be overlapped. Re-read LSTM
proposed by Sha et al. (2016) considers the attention vector of one sentence as the inner-state of
LSTM for another sentence. Chen et al. (2016) propose a sequential model that infers locally, and a
ensemble with tree-like inference module that further improves performance. We show our model,
DIIN, achieves state-of-the-art performance on the competitive leaderboard.

4.5 EXPERIMENT ON QUORA QUESTION PAIR DATASET

In this subsection, we evaluate the effectiveness of our model for paraphrase identiﬁcation as nat-
ural language inference task. Other than our baselines, we compare with Wang et al. (2017) and
Tomar et al. (2017). BIMPM models different perspective of matching between sentence pair on
both direction, then aggregates matching vector with LSTM. DECATTword and DECATTchar uses
automatically collected in-domain paraphrase data to noisy pretrain n-gram word embedding and n-
gram subword embedding correspondingly on decomposable attention model proposed by (Parikh
et al., 2016). In Table 4, our experiment shows DIIN has better performance than all other models
and an ensemble score is higher than the former best result for more than 1 percent.

4.6 ANALYSIS

Ablation Study We conduct a ablation study on our base model to examine the effectiveness of
each component. We study our model on MultiNLI dataset and we use Matched validation score
as the standard for model selection. The result is shown in Table 5. We studies how EM feature

contributes to the system. After removing the exact match binary feature, we ﬁnd the performance
degrade to 78.2 on matched score on development set and 78.0 on mismatched score. As observed in
reading comprehension task Chen et al. (2017a), the simple exact match feature does help the model
to better understand the sentences. In the experiment 3, we remove the convolutional feature extrac-
tor and then model is structured as a sentence-encoding based model. The sentence representation
matrix is max-pooled over time to obtain a feature vector. Once we have the feature vector p for
premise and h for hypothesis, we use [p; h; |p − h|; p ◦ h] as ﬁnal feature vector to classify the rela-
tionship. We obtain 73.2 for matched score and 73.6 on mismatched data. The result is competitive
among other sentence-encoding based model. We further study how encoding layer contribute in
enriching the feature space in interaction tensor. If we remove encoding layer completely, then we’ll
obtain a 73.5 for matched score and 73.2 for mismatched score. The result demonstrate the feature
extraction layer have powerful capability to capture the semantic feature. In experiment 5, we re-
move both self-attention and fuse gate, thus retaining only highway network. The result improves to
77.7 and 77.3 respectively on matched and mismatched development set. However, in experiment
6, when we only remove fuse gate, to our surprise, the performance degrade to 73.5 for matched
score and 73.8 for mismatched. On the other hand, if we use the addition of the representation after
highway network and the representation after self-attention as skip connection as in experiment 7,
the performance increase to 77.3 and 76.3. The comparison indicates self-attention layer makes the
training harder to converge while a skip connection could ease the gradient ﬂow for both highway
layer and self-attention layer. By comparing the base model and the model the in experiment 6, we
show that the fuse gate not only well serves as a skip connection, but also makes good decision upon
which information the fuse for both representation. To show that dense interaction tensor contains
more semantic information, we replace the dense interaction tensor with dot product similarity ma-
trix between the encoded representation of premise and hypothesis. The result shows that the dot
product similarity matrix has an inferior capacity of semantic information. Another dimensionality
study is provided in supplementary material. In experiment 9, we share the encoding layer weight,
and the result decrease from the baseline. The result shows that the two set of encoding weights
learn the subtle difference between premise and hypothesis.

Error analysis To analyze the model prediction, we use annotated subset of development set
provided by Williams et al. (2017) that consists of 1,000 examples each tagged with zero or more
following tags:

• CONDITIONAL: whether the sentence contains a conditional.
• WORD OVERLAP: whether both sentences share more than 70% of their tokens.
• NEGATION: whether a negation shows up in either sentence.
• ANTO: whether two sentences contain antonym pair.
• LONG SENTENCE: whether premise or hypothesis is longer than 30 or 16 tokens respec-

tively.

• TENSE DIFFERENCE: whether any verb in two sentences uses different tense.
• ACTIVE/PASSIVE: whether there is an active-to-passive (or vice versa) transformation

from the premise to the hypothesis.

• COREF: Whether the hypothesis contains a pronoun or referring expression that needs to

agree, disagree, deny, promise.

For more detailed descriptions, please resort to Williams et al. (2017). The result is shown in Table
6. We ﬁnd DIIN is consistently better on sentence pair with WORD OVERLAP, ANTO, LONG
SENTENCE, PARAPHRASE and BELIEF tags by a large margin. During investigation, we hy-
pothesize exact match feature helps the model to better understand paraphrase, therefore we study
the result from second ablation ablation study where exact match feature is not used. Surprisingly,
the model without exact model feature does not work worse on PARAPHRASE, instead, the accu-
racy on ANTO drops about 10%. DIIN is also work well on LONG SENTENCE, partially because
the receptive ﬁeld is large enough to cover all tokens.

Visualization We also visualize the hidden representation from interaction tensor I and the feature
map from ﬁrst dense block in Figure 2. We pick a sentence pair whose premise is “South Carolina
has no referendum right, so the Supreme Court canceled the vote and upheld the ban.” and hypothe-
sis is “South Carolina has a referendum right, so the Supreme Court was powerless over the state.”.
The upper row of ﬁgures are sampled from hidden representation of interaction tensor I. We observe
the values of neurons are highly correlated row-wise and column-wise in the interaction tensor I and
different channel of hidden representation shows different aspect of interaction. Though in certain
channel same words, “referendum”, or phrases, “supreme court”, cause activation, different word or
phrase pair, such as “ban” and “powerless over”, also cause activation in other activation. It shows
the model’s strong capacity of understanding text in different perspective. The lower row of Figure
2 shows the feature map from ﬁrst dense block. After being convolved from the interaction tensor

and previous feature map, new feature maps shows activation in different position, demonstrating
different semantic features are found. The ﬁrst ﬁgure in the lower row has similar pattern as normal
attention weight whereas others has no obvious pattern. Different channels of feature maps indicate
different kinds of semantic feature.

Figure 2: A visualization of hidden representation. The premise is “South Carolina has no refer-
endum right, so the Supreme Court canceled the vote and upheld the ban.” and the hypothesis is
“South Carolina has a referendum right, so the Supreme Court was powerless over the state.”. The
upper row are sampled from interaction tensor I and the lower row are sample from the feature map
of ﬁrst dense block. We use viridis colormap, where yellow represents activation and purple shows
the neuron is not active.

5 CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK

We show the interaction tensor (or attention weight) contains semantic information to understand
the natural language. We introduce Interactive Inference Network, a novel class of architecture that
allows the model to solve NLI or NLI alike tasks via extracting semantic feature from interaction
tensor end-to-end. One instance of such architecture, Densely Interactive Inference Network (DIIN),
achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple datasets. By ablating each component in DIIN and
changing the dimensionality, we show the effectiveness of each component in DIIN.

Though we have the initial exploration of natural language inference in interaction space, the full
potential is not yet clear. We will keep exploring the potential of interaction space. Incorporating
common-sense knowledge from external resources such as knowledge base to leverage the capacity
of the mode is another research goal of ours.

We thank Yuchen Lu, Chang Huang and Kai Yu for their sincere and insightful advice.

A SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIAL

Dimensionality and Parameter number study To study the inﬂuence of the model dimension d
which is also the channel number of interaction tensor, we design experiments to ﬁnd out whether
dimension has inﬂuence on performance. We also present the parameter count of these models.
The dimensionality is 448 where 300 comes from word embedding, 100 comes from char feature,
47 comes from Part of speech tagging and 1 comes from the binary exact match feature. Since
Highway network sets the output dimensionality default as that in input, we design a variant to
highway network so that different output size could be obtained. The variant of highway layer is
designed as follows:

t xi + bt)

g xi + bg)

ti = tanh(W (cid:62)
gi = σ(W (cid:62)
(cid:26)xi

x(cid:48)

i =

W (cid:62)

x xi + bx
oi = gi ◦ ti + (1 − gi) ◦ x(cid:48)
i

din = dout
din (cid:54)= dout

(9)

(10)

(11)

(12)

where xi is the i-th vector of input matrix x, oi is the i-th vector of output matrix o, W (cid:62)
W (cid:62)

x ∈ Rdin×dout and bt, bg, bx ∈ Rdout are trainable weights.

t , W (cid:62)
g ,

The result shows that higher dimension number have better performance when the dimension num-
ber is lower certain threshold, however, when the number of dimensionality is greater than the
threshold, larger number of parameter and higher dimensionality doesn’t contribute to performance.
In the case of SNLI, due to its simplicity in language pattern, 250D would be sufﬁce to obtain a
good performance. On the other hand, it requires 350D to achieve a competitive performance on
MultiNLI. We fail to reproduce our best performance with the new structure on MultiNLI. It shows
that the additional layer on highway network doesn’t helps convergence.
