Abstract

Although neural conversation models are ef-
fective in learning how to produce ﬂuent re-
sponses, their primary challenge lies in know-
ing what to say to make the conversation con-
tentful and non-vacuous. We present a new
end-to-end approach to contentful neural con-
versation that jointly models response gener-
ation and on-demand machine reading. The
key idea is to provide the conversation model
with relevant long-form text on the ﬂy as a
source of external knowledge. The model
performs QA-style reading comprehension on
this text in response to each conversational
turn, thereby allowing for more focused inte-
gration of external knowledge than has been
possible in prior approaches. To support fur-
ther research on knowledge-grounded conver-
sation, we introduce a new large-scale conver-
sation dataset grounded in external web pages
(2.8M turns, 7.4M sentences of grounding).
Both human evaluation and automated metrics
show that our approach results in more con-
tentful responses compared to a variety of pre-
vious methods, improving both the informa-
tiveness and diversity of generated output.

Introduction

While end-to-end neural conversation models
(Shang et al., 2015; Sordoni et al., 2015; Vinyals
and Le, 2015; Serban et al., 2016; Li et al., 2016a;
Gao et al., 2019a, etc.) are effective in learning
how to be ﬂuent, their responses are often vacu-
ous and uninformative. A primary challenge thus
lies in modeling what to say to make the conver-
sation contentful. Several recent approaches have
attempted to address this difﬁculty by condition-
ing the language decoder on external information
sources, such as knowledge bases (Agarwal et al.,
2018; Liu et al., 2018a), review posts (Ghazvinine-
jad et al., 2018; Moghe et al., 2018), and even im-
ages (Das et al., 2017; Mostafazadeh et al., 2017).

However, empirical results suggest that condition-
ing the decoder on rich and complex contexts,
while helpful, does not on its own provide sufﬁ-
cient inductive bias for these systems to learn how
to achieve deep and accurate integration between
external knowledge and response generation.

We posit that this ongoing challenge demands a
more effective mechanism to support on-demand
knowledge integration. We draw inspiration from
how humans converse about a topic, where peo-
ple often search and acquire external information
as needed to continue a meaningful and informa-
tive conversation. Figure 1 illustrates an example
human discussion, where information scattered in
separate paragraphs must be consolidated to com-

pose grounded and appropriate responses. Thus,
the challenge is to connect the dots across differ-
ent pieces of information in much the same way
that machine reading comprehension (MRC) sys-
tems tie together multiple text segments to provide
a uniﬁed and factual answer (Seo et al., 2017, etc.).
We introduce a new framework of end-to-
end conversation models that
jointly learn re-
sponse generation together with on-demand ma-
chine reading. We formulate the reading com-
prehension task as document-grounded response
generation: given a long document that supple-
ments the conversation topic, along with the con-
versation history, we aim to produce a response
that is both conversationally appropriate and in-
formed by the content of the document. The key
idea is to project conventional QA-based reading
comprehension onto conversation response gener-
ation by equating the conversation prompt with
the question, the conversation response with the
answer, and external knowledge with the con-
text. The MRC framing allows for integration
of long external documents that present notably
richer and more complex information than rela-
tively small collections of short, independent re-
view posts such as those that have been used in
prior work (Ghazvininejad et al., 2018; Moghe
et al., 2018).

We also introduce a large dataset

to facili-
tate research on knowledge-grounded conversa-
tion (2.8M turns, 7.4M sentences of grounding)
that is at least one order of magnitude larger than
existing datasets (Dinan et al., 2019; Moghe et al.,
2018). This dataset consists of real-world conver-
sations extracted from Reddit, linked to web doc-
uments discussed in the conversations. Empirical
results on our new dataset demonstrate that our full
model improves over previous grounded response
generation systems and various ungrounded base-
lines, suggesting that deep knowledge integration
is an important research direction.1

2 Task

We propose to use factoid- and entity-rich web
documents, e.g., news stories and Wikipedia
pages, as external knowledge sources for an open-
ended conversational system to ground in.

Formally, we are given a conversation history

1Code for reproducing our models and data is made
publicly available at https://github.com/qkaren/
converse_reading_cmr.

of turns X = (x1, . . . , xM ) and a web docu-
ment D = (s1, . . . , sN ) as the knowledge source,
where si is the ith sentence in the document. With
the pair (X, D), the system needs to generate a
natural language response y that is both conversa-
tionally appropriate and reﬂective of the contents
of the web document.

3 Approach

Our approach integrates conversation generation
with on-demand MRC. Speciﬁcally, we use an
MRC model to effectively encode the conversation
history by treating it as a question in a typical QA
task (e.g., SQuAD (Rajpurkar et al., 2016)), and
encode the web document as the context. We then
replace the output component of the MRC model
(which is usually an answer classiﬁcation mod-
ule) with an attentional sequence generator that
generates a free-form response. We refer to our
approach as CMR (Conversation with on-demand
Machine Reading). In general, any off-the-shelf
MRC model could be applied here for knowledge
comprehension. We use Stochastic Answer Net-
works (SAN)2 (Liu et al., 2018b), a performant
machine reading model that until very recently
held state-of-the-art performance on the SQuAD
benchmark. We also employ a simple but effec-
tive data weighting scheme to further encourage
response grounding.

3.1 Document and Conversation Reading

We adapt the SAN model to encode both the in-
put document and conversation history and for-
ward the digested information to a response gen-
erator. Figure 2 depicts the overall MRC architec-
ture. Different blocks capture different concepts of
representations in both the input conversation his-
tory and web document. The leftmost blocks rep-
resent the lexicon encoding that extracts informa-
tion from X and D at the token level. Each token
is ﬁrst transformed into its corresponding word
embedding vector, and then fed into a position-
wise feed-forward network (FFN) (Vaswani et al.,
2017) to obtain the ﬁnal token-level representa-
tion. Separate FFNs are used for the conversation
history and the web document.

The next block is for contextual encoding.
The aforementioned token vectors are concate-
nated with pre-trained 600-dimensional CoVe vec-
tors (McCann et al., 2017), and then fed to a BiL-

2https://github.com/kevinduh/san_mrc

Figure 2: Model Architecture for Response Generation with on-demand Machine Reading: The ﬁrst blocks
of the MRC-based encoder serve as a lexicon encoding that maps words to their embeddings and transforms with
position-wise FFN, independently for the conversation history and the document. The next block is for contextual
encoding, where BiLSTMs are applied to the lexicon embeddings to model the context for both conversation
history and document. The last block builds the ﬁnal encoder memory, by sequentially applying cross-attention
in order to integrate the two information sources, conversation history and document, self-attention for salient
information retrieval, and a BiLSTM for ﬁnal information rearrangement. The response generator then attends to
the memory and generates a free-form response.

STM that is shared for both conversation history
and web document. The step-wise outputs of the
BiLSTM carry the information of the tokens as
well as their left and right context.

The last block builds the memory that sum-
marizes the salient information from both X and
D. The block ﬁrst applies cross-attention to in-
tegrate information from the conversation history
X into the document representation. Each contex-
tual vector of the document D is used to compute
attention (similarity) distribution over the contex-
tual vectors of X, which is concatenated with the
weighted average vector of X by the resulting dis-
tribution. Second, a self -attention layer is applied
to further ingest and capture the most salient in-
formation. The output memory, M ∈ Rd×n, is
obtained by applying another BiLSTM layer for
ﬁnal information rearrangement. Note that d is the
hidden size of the memory and n is the length of
the document.

3.2 Response Generation

Having read and processed both the conversation
history and the extra knowledge in the document,
the model then produces a free-form response y =
(y1, . . . , yT ) instead of generating a span or per-
forming answer classiﬁcation as in MRC tasks.

We use an attentional recurrent neural network
decoder (Luong et al., 2015) to generate response
tokens while attending to the memory. At the be-
ginning, the initial hidden state h0 is the weighted
sum of the representation of the history X. For

each decoding step t with a hidden state ht, we
generate a token yt based on the distribution:

p(yt) = softmax((W1ht + b)/τ ),

(1)

where τ > 0 is the softmax temperature. The hid-
den state ht is deﬁned as follows:

ht = W2[zt ++fattention(zt, M )].

(2)

Here, [· ++·] indicates a concatenation of two vec-
tors; fattention is a dot-product attention (Vaswani
et al., 2017); and zt
is a state generated by
GRU(et−1, ht−1) with et−1 being the embedding
of the word yt−1 generated at the previous (t − 1)
step. In practice, we use top-k sample decoding
to draw yt from the above distribution p(yt). Sec-
tion 5 provides more details about the experimen-
tal conﬁguration.

3.3 Data Weighting Scheme

We further propose a simple data weighting
scheme to encourage the generation of grounded
responses. The idea is to bias the model train-
ing to ﬁt better to those training instances where
the ground-truth response is more closely relevant
to the document. More speciﬁcally, given a train-
ing instance (X, D, y), we measure the closeness
score c ∈ R between the document D and the
gold response y (e.g., with the NIST (Doddington,
2002) or BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002) metrics). In
each training data batch, we normalize the close-
ness scores of all the instances to have a sum of

stances with grounded responses and thus encour-
ages the model to better encode and utilize the in-
formation in the document.

4 Dataset

To create a grounded conversational dataset, we
extract conversation threads from Reddit, a popu-
lar and large-scale online platform for news and
discussion.
In 2015 alone, Reddit hosted more
than 73M conversations.3 On Reddit, user sub-
missions are categorized by topics or “subreddits”,
and a submission typically consists of a submis-
sion title associated with a URL pointing to a news
or background article, which initiates a discus-
sion about the contents of the article. This ar-
ticle provides framing for the conversation, and
this can naturally be seen as a form of ground-
ing. Another factor that makes Reddit conversa-
tions particularly well-suited for our conversation-
as-MRC setting is that a signiﬁcant proportion of
these URLs contain named anchors (i.e., ‘#’ in the
URL) that point to the relevant passages in the
document. This is conceptually quite similar to
MRC data (Rajpurkar et al., 2016) where typically
only short passages within a larger document are
relevant in answering the question.

We reduce spamming and offensive language by
manually curating a list of 178 relatively “safe”
subreddits and 226 web domains from which the
web pages are extracted. To convert the web page
of each conversation into a text document, we ex-
tracted the text of the page using an html-to-text
converter,4 while retaining important tags such as
<title>, <h1> to <h6>, and <p>. This means the

BeautifulSoup

4https://www.crummy.com/software/

entire text of the original web page is preserved,
but these main tags retain some high-level struc-
ture of the article. For web URLs with named an-
chors, we preserve that information by indicating
the anchor text in the document with tags <an-
chor> and </anchor>. As the whole documents
in the dataset tend to be lengthy, anchors offer im-
portant hints to the model about which parts of the
documents should likely be focused on in order to
produce a good response. We considered it sensi-
ble to keep them as they are also available to the
human reader.

After ﬁltering short or redacted turns, or which
quote earlier turns, we obtained 2.8M conversa-
tion instances respectively divided into train, vali-
dation, and test (Table 1). We used different date
ranges for these different sets: years 2011-2016
for train, Jan-Mar 2017 for validation, and the rest
of 2017 for test. For the test set, we select con-
versational turns for which 6 or more responses
were available, in order to create a multi-reference
test set. Given other ﬁltering criteria such as turn
length, this yields a 6-reference test set of size
2208. For each instance, we set aside one of the
6 human responses to assess human performance
on this task, and the remaining 5 responses serve
as ground truths for evaluating different systems.5
Table 1 provides statistics for our dataset, and Fig-
ure 1 presents an example from our dataset that
also demonstrates the need to combine conversa-
tion history and background information from the
document to produce an informative response.

To enable reproducibility of our experiments,
we crawled web pages using Common Crawl
(http://commoncrawl.org), a service that
crawls web pages and makes its historical crawls
available to the public. We also release the code
(URL redacted for anonymity) to recreate our
dataset from both a popular Reddit dump6 and
Common Crawl, and the latter service ensures
that anyone reproducing our data extraction exper-
iments would retrieve exactly the same web pages.
We made a preliminary version of this dataset
available for a shared task (Galley et al., 2019)
at Dialog System Technology Challenges (DSTC)
(Yoshino et al., 2019). Back-and-forth with partic-

5While this is already large for a grounded dataset, we
could have easily created a much bigger one given how abun-
dant Reddit data is. We focused instead on ﬁltering out spam-
ming and offensive language, in order to strike a good balance
between data quality and size.

code to recreate this dataset is included.7

5 Experiments

5.1 Systems

We evaluate our systems and several competitive
baselines:
SEQ2SEQ (Sutskever et al., 2014) We use a stan-
dard LSTM SEQ2SEQ model that only exploit
the conversation history for response generation,
without any grounding. This is a competitive base-
line initialized using pretrained embeddings.
MEMNET: We use a Memory Network designed
for grounded response generation (Ghazvinine-
jad et al., 2018). An end-to-end memory net-
work (Sukhbaatar et al., 2015) encodes conversa-
tion history and sentences in the web documents.
Responses are generated with a sequence decoder.
CMR-F : To directly measure the effect of incor-
porating web documents, we compare to a base-
line which omits the document reading component
of the full model (Figure 2). As with the SEQ2SEQ
approach, the resulting model generates responses
solely based on conversation history.
CMR: To measure the effect of our data weighting
scheme, we compare to a system that has identical
architecture to the full model, but is trained with-
out associating weights to training instances.
CMR+W: As described in section 3, the full
model reads and comprehends both the conversa-
tion history and document using an MRC compo-
nent, and sequentially generates the response. The
model is trained with the data weighting scheme
to encourage grounded responses.
Human: To get a better sense of the systems’
performance relative to an upper bound, we also
evaluate human-written responses using different
metrics. As described in Section 4, for each test
instance, we set aside one of the 6 human refer-
ences for evaluation, so the ‘human’ is evaluated
against the other 5 references for automatic eval-
uation. To make these results comparable, all the
systems are also automatically evaluated against
the same 5 references.

7We do not report on shared task systems here, as these
systems do not represent our work and some of these sys-
tems have no corresponding publications. Along with the
data described here, we provided a standard SEQ2SEQ base-
line to the shared task, which we improved for the purpose of
this paper (improved BLEU, NIST and METEOR). Our new
SEQ2SEQ baseline is described in Section 5.

For all the systems, we set word embedding di-
mension to 300 and used the pretrained GloVe8 for
initialization. We set hidden dimensions to 512
and dropout rate to 0.4. GRU cells are used for
SEQ2SEQ and MEMNET (we also tested LSTM
cells and obtained similar results). We used the
Adam optimizer for model training, with an ini-
tial learning rate of 0.0005. Batch size was set to
32. During training, all responses were truncated
to have a maximum length of 30, and maximum
query length and document length were set to 30,
500, respectively. we used regular teacher-forcing
decoding during training. For inference, we found
that top-k random sample decoding (Fan et al.,
2018) provides the best results for all the systems.
That is, at each decoding step, a token was drawn
from the k most likely candidates according to the
distribution over the vocabulary. Similar to recent
work (Fan et al., 2018; Edunov et al., 2018), we
set k = 20 (other common k values like 10 gave
similar results). We selected key hyperparameter
conﬁgurations on the validation set.

6.1 Evaluation Setup

Table 2 shows automatic metrics for quantitative
evaluation over three qualities of generated texts.
We measure the overall relevance of the generated
responses given the conversational history by us-
ing standard Machine Translation (MT) metrics,
comparing generated outputs to ground-truth re-
sponses. These metrics include BLEU-4 (Papineni
et al., 2002), METEOR (Lavie and Agarwal, 2007).
and NIST (Doddington, 2002). The latter metric is
a variant of BLEU that weights n-gram matches
by their information gain by effectively penalizing
uninformative n-grams (such as “I don’t know”),
which makes it a relevant metric for evaluating
systems aiming diverse and informative responses.
MT metrics may not be particularly adequate for
our task (Liu et al., 2016), given its focus on the
informativeness of responses, and for that reason
we also use two other types of metrics to measure
the level of grounding and diversity.

As a diversity metric, we count all n-grams in
the system output for the test set, and measure:
(1) Entropy-n as the entropy of the n-gram count
distribution, a metric proposed in (Zhang et al.,
2018b); (2) Distinct-n as the ratio between the

Table 2: Automatic Evaluation results (higher is better for all metrics). Our best models (CMR+W and CMR)
considerably increase the quantitative measures of Grounding, and also slightly improve Diversity. Automatic
measures of Quality (e.g., BLEU-4) give mixed results, but this is reﬂective of the fact that we did not aim to
improve response relevance with respect to the context, but instead its level of grounding. The human evaluation
results in Table 3 indeed suggest that our best system (CMR+W) is better.

number of n-gram types and the total number of
n-grams, a metric introduced in (Li et al., 2016a).
For the grounding metrics, we ﬁrst compute
‘#match,’ the number of non-stopword tokens in
the response that are present in the document
but not present in the context of the conversa-
tion. Excluding words from the conversation his-
tory means that, in order to produce a word of
the document, the response generation system is
very likely to be effectively inﬂuenced by that
document. We then compute both precision as
‘#match’ divided by the total number of non-stop
tokens in the response, and recall as ‘#match’ di-
vided by the total number of non-stop tokens in
the document. We also compute the respective F1
score to combine both. Looking only at exact uni-
gram matches between the document and response
is a major simplifying assumption, but the combi-
nation of the three metrics offers a plausible proxy
for how greatly the response is grounded in the
document. It seems further reasonable to assume
that these can serve as a surrogate for less quan-
tiﬁable forms of grounding such as paraphrase –
e.g., US −→ American – when the statistics are ag-
gregated on a large test dataset.

6.2 Automatic Evaluation

Table 2 shows automatic evaluation results for
the different systems.
In terms of appropriate-
ness, the different variants of our models outper-
form the SEQ2SEQ and MEMNET baselines, but
differences are relatively small and, in case of
one of the metrics (NIST), the best system does
not use grounding. Our goal, we would note, is
not to speciﬁcally improve response appropriate-
ness, as many responses that completely ignore
the document (e.g., I don’t know) might be per-

in terms of Grounding and Diversity: our best sys-
tem (CMR+W) achieves an F1 score that is more
than three times (0.38% vs. 0.12%) higher than the
most competitive non-MRC system (MEMNET).

6.3 Human Evaluation

We sampled 1000 conversations from the test set.
Filters were applied to remove conversations con-
taining ethnic slurs or other offensive content that
might confound judgments. Outputs from systems
to be compared were presented pairwise to judges
from a crowdsourcing service. Four judges were
asked to compare each pair of outputs on Rele-
vance (the extent to which the content was related
to and appropriate to the conversation) and Infor-
mativeness (the extent to which the output was in-
teresting and informative). Judges were asked to
agree or disagree with a statement that one of the
pair was better than the other on the above two
parameters, using a 5-point Likert scale.9 Pairs

of system outputs were randomly presented to the
judges in random order in the context of short
snippets of the background text. These results
are presented in summary form in Table 3, which
shows the overall preferences for the two systems
expressed as a percentage of all judgments made.
Overall inter-rater agreement measured by Fliess’
Kappa was 0.32 (“fair"). Nevertheless, the differ-
ences between the paired model outputs are sta-
tistically signiﬁcant (computed using 10,000 boot-
strap replications).

6.4 Qualitative Study

Table 4 illustrates how our best model (CMR+W)
tends to produce more contentful and informa-
tive responses compared to the other systems. In
the ﬁrst example, our system refers to a particu-
lar episode mentioned in the article, and also uses
terminology that is more consistent with the ar-

ticle (e.g., series).

sponse, which is helpful as the input doesn’t men-
tion singing at all.
the
CMR+W model clearly grounds its response to
the article as it states the fact (Steve Jobs: CEO
of Apple) retrieved from the article. The outputs
by the other two baseline models are instead not
relevant in the context.

In the third example,

Figure 3 displays the attention map of the gen-
erated response and (part of) the document from
our full model. The model successfully attends to
the key words (e.g., 36th, episode) of the docu-
ment. Note that the attention map is unlike what is
typical in machine translation, where target words
tend to attend to different portions of the input text.
In our task, where alignments are much less one-
to-one compared to machine translation, it is com-
mon for the generator to retain focus on the key
information in the external document to produce
semantically relevant responses.

Dialogue: Traditional dialogue systems (see
(Jurafsky and Martin, 2009) for an historical per-
spective) are typically grounded, enabling these
systems to be reﬂective of the user’s environment.
The lack of grounding has been a stumbling block
for the earliest end-to-end dialogue systems, as
various researchers have noted that their outputs
tend to be bland (Li et al., 2016a; Gao et al.,
2019b), inconsistent (Zhang et al., 2018a; Li et al.,

texts (Das et al., 2017; Mostafazadeh et al., 2017;
Agarwal et al., 2018; Yang et al., 2019). A recent
survey is included in Gao et al. (2019a).

Prior work, e.g, (Ghazvininejad et al., 2018;
Zhang et al., 2018a; Huang et al., 2019), uses
grounding in the form of independent snippets of
text: Foursquare tips and background information
about a given speaker. Our notion of grounding
is different, as our inputs are much richer, encom-
passing the full text of a web page and its underly-
ing structure. Our setting also differs signiﬁcantly
from relatively recent work (Dinan et al., 2019;
Moghe et al., 2018) exploiting crowdsourced con-
versations with detailed grounding labels: we use
Reddit because of its very large scale and bet-
ter characterization of real-world conversations.
We also require the system to learn grounding di-
rectly from conversation and document pairs, in-
stead of relying on additional grounding labels.
Moghe et al. (2018) explored directly using a
span-prediction QA model for conversation. Our
framework differs in that we combine MRC mod-
els with a sequence generator to produce free-form
responses.

Machine Reading Comprehension: MRC
models such as SQuAD-like models, aim to
extract answer spans (starting and ending indices)

<title> Investigations </title> <p> "Investigations" is the 36th episode of the American science ﬁction televi-
sion series Star Trek: Voyager which aired on the UPN network. It is the 36th episode of the second season.
</p> Set in the 24th century, the series follows the adventures of the Federation starship Voyager during its
journey home to Earth, having been stranded tens of thousands of light-years away. [...]
[...] King Abdullah II of Jordon once cameo’d as an unnamed ensign on Star Trek Voyager
I think it should be noted that he is like a good guy who just killed her and her son.

MEMNET
SEQ2SEQ well , i didn’t know , but i was just saying that it wasn’t a joke.
CMR+W I am not sure if it was a “perfect” episode, but I think I saw the episode where he was the voice of the Star

Trek series.

<title> “Weird Al” Yankovic </title> <p> Alfred Matthew “Weird Al” Yankovic is an American singer,
songwriter, parodist, record producer, satirist, actor, voice actor, music video director, ﬁlm producer, and
author. He is known for his humorous songs that make light of popular culture and often parody speciﬁc
songs by contemporary musical acts, original songs that are style pastiches of the work of other acts, and
polka medleys of several popular songs, featuring his favored instrument, the accordion.</p> (Prince and
West mentioned several times in the rest of the article.) [...]
That’s fair, I believe Weird Al always got permission from artists before he parodied them which is nice.

MEMNET Well then you don’t need to make a sequel to the front page of the movie.
SEQ2SEQ
CMR+W No, because his song was a parody of the artist formerly known as "Kanye West".

If I remember correctly. I had no idea who had any good chance in history class.

<title> Steve Jobs </title> <p> Steven Paul Jobs was an American entrepreneur, businessman, inventor, and
industrial designer. He was the chairman, chief executive ofﬁcer (CEO), and co-founder of Apple Inc.;
chairman and majority shareholder of Pixar; a member of The Walt Disney Company’s board of directors
following its acquisition of Pixar; and the founder, chairman, and CEO of next. [...] </p>
Steve Jobs was a mediocre programmer and one of the greatest designers and marketers in human history.
But I prefer Bill Gates if we want to talk about hero worship myself. [...]

MEMNET What if you don’t want to see this movie?
SEQ2SEQ No ... the whole point is that this is a good way to make a difference.
CMR+W So he’s the CEO of Apple.

from a given document for a given question (Seo
et al., 2017; Liu et al., 2018b; Yu et al., 2018).
These models differ in how they fuse information
between questions and documents. We chose
SAN (Liu et al., 2018b) because of its representa-
tive architecture and competitive performance on
existing MRC tasks. We note that other off-the-
shelf MRC models, such as BERT (Devlin et al.,
2018), can also be plugged in. We leave the study
of different MRC architectures for future work.
Questions are treated as entirely independent
in these “single-turn” MRC models, so recent
work (e.g., CoQA (Reddy et al., 2019) and QuAC
(Choi et al., 2018)) focuses on multi-turn MRC,
modeling sequences of questions and answers
in a conversation. While multi-turn MRC aims
to answer complex questions, that body of work
is restricted to factual questions, whereas our
work—like much of the prior work in end-to-end
dialogue—models free-form dialogue, which also
encompasses chitchat and non-factual responses.

8 Conclusions

We have demonstrated that the machine reading
comprehension approach offers a promising step

to generating, on the ﬂy, contentful conversation
exchanges that are grounded in extended text cor-
pora. The functional combination of MRC and
neural attention mechanisms offers visible gains
over several strong baselines. We have also for-
mally introduced a large dataset that opens up in-
teresting challenges for future research.

The CMR (Conversation with on-demand ma-
chine reading) model presented here will help con-
nect the many dots across multiple data sources.
One obvious future line of investigation will be to
explore the effect of other off-the-shelf machine
reading models such as BERT (Devlin et al., 2018)
within the CMR framework.
