Abstract

Generating multi-view images from a single-view
input is an essential yet challenging problem. It has
broad applications in vision, graphics, and robotics.
Our study indicates that the widely-used generative
adversarial network (GAN) may learn “incomplete”
representations due to the single-pathway frame-
work: an encoder-decoder network followed by a
discriminator network. We propose CR-GAN to
address this problem. In addition to the single recon-
struction path, we introduce a generation sideway to
maintain the completeness of the learned embedding
space. The two learning pathways collaborate and
compete in a parameter-sharing manner, yielding
considerably improved generalization ability to “un-
seen” dataset. More importantly, the two-pathway
framework makes it possible to combine both la-
beled and unlabeled data for self-supervised learn-
ing, which further enriches the embedding space
for realistic generations. The experimental results
prove that CR-GAN signiﬁcantly outperforms state-
of-the-art methods, especially when generating from
“unseen” inputs in wild conditions. 1

1 Introduction
Generating multi-view images from a single-view input is an
interesting problem with broad applications in vision, graphics,
and robotics. Yet, it is a challenging problem since 1) comput-
ers need to “imagine” what a given object would look like after
a 3D rotation is applied; and 2) the multi-view generations
should preserve the same “identity”.

Generally speaking, previous solutions to this problem in-
clude model-driven synthesis [Blanz and Vetter, 1999], data-
driven generation [Zhu et al., 2014; Yan et al., 2016], and
a combination of the both [Zhu et al., 2016; Rezende et al.,
2016]. Recently, generative adversarial networks (GANs)
[Goodfellow et al., 2014] have shown impressive results in
multi-view generation [Tran et al., 2017; Zhao et al., 2017].
These GAN-based methods usually have a single-pathway
design: an encoder-decoder network is followed by a discrim-

Figure 1: Top: The limitation of existing GAN-based methods. They
can generate good results if the input is mapped into the learned
subspace (Row 1). However, “unseen” data may be mapped out of
the subspace, leading to poor results (Row 2). Bottom: Our results.
By learning complete representations, the proposed CR-GAN can
generate realistic, identity-preserved images from a single-view input.

inator network. The encoder (E) maps input images into a
latent space (Z), where the embeddings are ﬁrst manipulated
and then fed into the decoder (G) to generate novel views.

However, our experiments indicate that this single-pathway
design may have a severe issue: they can only learn “incom-
plete” representations, yielding limited generalization ability
on “unseen” or unconstrained data. Take Fig. 1 as an example.
During the training, the outputs of E constitute only a sub-
space of Z since we usually have a limited number of training
samples. This would make G only “see” part of Z. During
the testing, it is highly possible that E would map an “unseen”
input outside the subspace. As a result, G may produce poor
results due to the unexpected embedding.

To address this issue, we propose CR-GAN to learn Com-
plete Representations for multi-view generation. The main
idea is, in addition to the reconstruction path, we introduce
another generation path to create view-speciﬁc images from
embeddings that are randomly sampled from Z. Please refer
to Fig. 2 for an illustration. The two paths share the same G.
In other words, G learned in the generation path will guide
the learning of both E and D in the reconstruction path, and
vice versa. E is forced to be an inverse of G, yielding com-
plete representations that would span the entire Z space. More
importantly, the two-pathway learning can easily utilize both
labeled and unlabeled data for self-supervised learning, which

can largely enrich the Z space for natural generations.

To sum up, we have following contributions:

• To the best of our knowledge, we are the ﬁrst to investi-

gate “complete representations” of GAN models;

• We propose CR-GAN that can learn “complete” repre-

sentations, using a two-pathway learning scheme;

• CR-GAN can leverage unlabeled data for self-supervised

learning, yielding improved generation quality;

• CR-GAN can generate high-quality multi-view images

from even “unseen” dataset in wild conditions.

2 Related Work

Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). Goodfellow et
al. [Goodfellow et al., 2014] introduced GAN to estimate
target distribution via an adversarial process. Gulrajani et
al. [Gulrajani et al., 2017] presented a more stable approach to
enforce Lipschitz Constraint on Wasserstein GAN [Arjovsky
et al., 2017]. AC-GAN et al. [Odena et al., 2017] extended the
discriminator by containing an auxiliary decoder network to
estimate class labels for the training data. BiGANs [Donahue
et al., 2017; Dumoulin et al., 2017] try to learn an inverse
mapping to project data back into the latent space. Our method
can also ﬁnd an inverse mapping, make a balanced minimax
game when training data is limited.

Multi-view Synthesis. Hinton et al. [Hinton et al., 2011]
introduced transforming auto-encoder to generate images with
view variance. Yan et al. [Yan et al., 2016] proposed Perspec-
tive Transformer Nets to ﬁnd the projection transformation.
Zhou et al. [Zhou et al., 2016] propose to synthesize views
by appearance ﬂow. Very recently, GAN-based methods usu-
ally follow a single-pathway design: an encoder-decoder net-
work [Peng et al., 2016] followed by a discriminator network.
For example, to normalize the viewpoint, e.g. face frontaliza-
tion, they either combine encoder-decoder with 3DMM [Blanz
and Vetter, 1999] parameters [Yin et al., 2017], or use dupli-
cates to predict global and local details [Huang et al., 2017].
DR-GAN [Tran et al., 2017] follows the single-pathway frame-
work to learn identity features that are invariant to viewpoints.
However, it may learn “incomplete” representations due to the
single-pathway framework. In contrast, CR-GAN can learn
complete representations using a two-pathway network, which
guarantees high-quality generations even for “unseen” inputs.
Pose-Invariant Representation Learning. For represen-
tation learning [Li et al., 2016; Fan et al., 2016], early works
may use Canonical Correlation Analysis to analyze the com-
monality among different pose subspaces [Hardoon et al.,
2004; Peng et al., 2015]. Recently, deep learning based
methods use synthesized images to disentangle pose and
identity factors by cross-reconstruction [Zhu et al., 2014;
Peng et al., 2017], or transfer information from pose variant
inputs to a frontalized appearance [Zhu et al., 2013]. However,
they usually use only labeled data, leading to a limited perfor-
mance. We proposed a two-pathway network to leverage both
labeled and unlabeled data for self-supervised learning, which
can generate realistic images in challenging conditions.

Figure 2: Left: Previous methods use a single path to learn the
latent representation, but it is incomplete in the whole space. Right:
We propose a two-pathway network combined with self-supervised
learning, which can learn complete representations.

3 Proposed Method
3.1 A Toy Example of Incomplete Representations
A single-pathway network, i.e. an encoder-decoder network
followed by a discriminator network, may have the issue of
learning “incomplete” representations. As illustrated in Fig. 2
left, the encoder E and decoder G can “touch” only a subspace
of Z since we usually have a limited number of training data.
This would lead to a severe issue in testing when using “un-
seen” data as the input. It is highly possible that E may map
the novel input out of the subspace, which inevitably leads to
poor generations since G has never “seen” the embedding.

A toy example is used to explain this point. We use Multi-
PIE [Gross et al., 2010] to train a single-pathway network. As
shown in the top of Fig. 1, the network can generate realistic
results on Multi-PIE (the ﬁrst row), as long as the input image
is mapped into the learned subspace. However, when testing
“unseen” images from IJB-A [Klare et al., 2015], the network
may produce unsatisfactory results (the second row). In this
case, the new image is mapped out of the learned subspace.

This fact motivates us to train E and G that can “cover” the
whole Z space, so we can learn complete representations. We
achieve this goal by introducing a separate generation path,
where the generator focuses on mapping the entire Z space to
high-quality images. Fig. 2 illustrates the comparison between
the single-pathway and two-pathway networks. Please refer to
Fig. 3 (d) for an overview of our approach.

3.2 Generation Path
The generation path trains generator G and discriminator D.
Here the encoder E is not involved since G tries to generate
from random noise. Given a view label v and random noise
z, G aims to produce a realistic image G(v, z) under view v.
D is trying to distinguish real data from G’s output, which
minimizes:

E
z∼Pz

[Ds(G(v, z))] − E

[Ds(x)]+

x∼Px

[P (Dv(x) = v)],

(1)

where Px is the data distribution and Pz is the noise uniform
distribution, Pˆx is an interpolation between pairs of points
sampled from data distribution and the generator distribu-
tion [Gulrajani et al., 2017]. G tries to fool D, it maximizes:

E
z∼Pz

[Ds(G(v, z))] + λ3 E

where (Dv(·), Ds(·)) = D(·) denotes pairwise outputs of
the discriminator. Dv(·) estimates the probability of being a

share the same identity);

speciﬁc view, Ds(·) describes the image quality, i.e., how real
the image is. Note that in Eq. 1, D learns how to estimate the
correct view of a real image [Odena et al., 2017], while G
tries to produce an image with that view in order to get a high
score from D in Eq. 2.

3.3 Reconstruction Path
The reconstruction path trains E and D but keeping G ﬁxed.
E tries to reconstruct training samples, this would guarantee
that E will be learned as an inverse of G, yielding complete
representations in the latent embedding space.

The output of E should be identity-preserved so the multi-
view images will present the same identity. We propose a
cross reconstruction task to make E disentangle the viewpoint
from the identity. More speciﬁcally, we sample a real image
pair (xi, xj) that share the same identity but different views
vi and vj. The goal is to reconstruct xj from xi. To achieve
this, E takes xi as input and outputs an identity-preserved
representation ¯z together with the view estimation ¯v: (¯v, ¯z) =
(Ev(xi), Ez(xi)) = E(xi). Note that ¯v is learned for further
self-supervised training as shown in Sec. 3.4.

G takes ¯z and view vj as the input. As ¯z is expected to carry
the identity information of this person, with view vj’s help, G
should produce ˜xj, the reconstruction of xj. D is trained to
distinguish the fake image ˜xj from the real one xi. Thus D
minimizes:

E
xi,xj ∼Px

[Ds(˜xj) − Ds(xi)]+

λ1 E

ˆx∼Pˆx

[((cid:107)(cid:53)ˆxD(ˆx)(cid:107)2 − 1)2] − λ2 E

[P (Dv(xi) = vi)],

xi∼Px

where ˜xj = G(vj, Ez(xi)). E helps G to generate high
quality image with view vj, so E maximizes:

E
xi,xj ∼Px

[Ds(˜xj) + λ3P (Dv(˜xj) = vj)−

λ4L1(˜xj, xj) − λ5Lv(Ev(xi), vi)],

(3)

(4)

where L1 loss is utilized to enforce that ˜xj is the reconstruction
of xj. Lv is the cross-entropy loss of estimated and ground
truth views, to let E be a good view estimator.

The two-pathway network learns complete representations:
First, in the generation path, G learns how to produce real

end

images from any inputs in the latent space. Then, in the
reconstruction path, G retains the generative ability since it
keeps unchanged. The alternative training details of the two
pathways are summarized in Algorithm 1.
3.4 Self-supervised Learning
Labeled datasets are usually limited and biased. For example,
Multi-PIE [Gross et al., 2010] is collected in a constrained set-
ting, while large-pose images in 300wLP [Zhu et al., 2016] are
distorted. As a result, G would generate low-quality images
since it has only “seen” poor and limited examples.

To solve this issue, we further improve the proposed CR-
GAN with self-supervised learning. The key idea is to use a
pre-trained model to estimate viewpoints for unlabeled images.
Accordingly, we modify the supervised training algorithm
into two phases. In the ﬁrst stage, we pre-train the network
on labeled data to let E be a good view estimator. In the
second stage, both labeled and unlabeled data are utilized to
boost G. When an unlabeled image x is fed to the network,
a view estimation ¯v is obtained by Ev(·). Denote ˆv to be the
closest one-hot vector of ¯v, in the reconstruction path, we let
E minimize Lv(¯v, ˆv) and then reconstruct x to itself. Similar
to Eq. 3, D minimizes:

E
x∼Px

[Ds(G(ˆv, Ez(x))) − Ds(x)]+

λ1 E

ˆx∼Pˆx

[((cid:107)(cid:53)ˆxD(ˆx)(cid:107)2 − 1)2] − λ2 E
x∼Px

[P (Dv(x) = ˆv)],

similar to Eq. 4, E maximizes:

E
x∼Px

[Ds(G(ˆv, Ez(x))) + λ3P (Dv(G(ˆv, Ez(x))) = ˆv)−

λ4L1(G(ˆv, Ez(x)), x) − λ5Lv(Ev(x), ˆv)].
In the generation path, we let ˆv be the ground truth of x, and
generate an image in view ˆv. So similar to Eq. 1, D minimizes:

E
z∼Pz

[Ds(G(ˆv, z))] − E

[Ds(x)]+

x∼Px
[((cid:107)(cid:53)ˆxD(ˆx)(cid:107)2 − 1)2] − λ2 E

similar to Eq. 2, G maximizes:

E
z∼Pz

[Ds(G(ˆv, z))] + λ3 E
z∼Pz

[P (Dv(G(z)) = ˆv)].

(8)

Once we get the pre-trained model, the encoder E predicts
the probabilities of the input image belonging to different
views. We choose the view with the highest probability as the
estimation. Our strategy is similar to RANSAC algorithm [Fis-
chler and Bolles, 1981], where we treat the estimations with
higher conﬁdence as “inliers” and use them to make view es-
timation more accurate. We summarize the self-supervised
training in Algorithm 2.

Compared with the single-pathway solution, the proposed
two-pathway network boosts the self-supervised learning in
two aspects: 1) it provides a better pre-trained model for
viewpoint estimation as a byproduct; and 2) it guarantees that
we can take full advantage of unlabeled data in training since
CR-GAN learns complete representations.

3.5 Discussion
To highlight the novelty of our method, we compare CR-GAN
with the following three GANs.
In Fig. 3, we show their
network structures as well as ours for visual comparison.

BiGAN [Donahue et al., 2017; Dumoulin et al., 2017]
jointly learns a generation network G and an inference net-
work E. The authors proved that E is an inverse network of
G. However, in practice, BiGAN produces poor reconstruc-
tions due to ﬁnite data and limited network capacity. Instead,
CR-GAN uses explicit reconstruction loss to solve this issue.
DR-GAN [Tran et al., 2017] also tries to learn an identity
preserved representation to synthesize multi-view images. But
we have two distinct differences. First, the output of its en-
coder, also acts as the decoder’s input, completely depends
on the training dataset. Therefore, it can not deal with new
data. Instead, we use the generation path to make sure that
the learning of our G is “complete”. Second, we don’t let
D estimate the identity for training data, because we employ
unlabeled dataset in self-supervised learning which has no
identity information. The involvement of unlabeled dataset
also makes our model more robust for “unseen” data.

TP-GAN [Huang et al., 2017] uses two pathway GANs for
frontal view synthesis. Their framework is different from ours:
First, they use two distinct encoder-decoder networks, while
CR-GAN shares all modules in the two pathways. Besides,

they use two pathways to capture global features and local
details, while we focus on learning complete representations
in multi-view generation.

4 Experiments
CR-GAN aims to learn complete representations in the em-
bedding space. We achieve this goal by combining the two-
pathway architecture with self-supervised learning. We con-
duct experiments to evaluate these two contributions respec-
tively. Then we compare our CR-GAN with DR-GAN [Tran
et al., 2017], both the visual results and t-SNE visualization in
the embedding space are shown. We also compare CR-GAN
and BiGAN with an image reconstruction task.

4.1 Experimental Settings
Datasets. We evaluate CR-GAN on datasets with and without
view labels. Multi-PIE [Gross et al., 2010] is a labeled dataset
collected under constrained environment. We use 250 subjects
from the ﬁrst session with 9 poses within ±60◦, 20 illumi-
nations, and two expressions. The ﬁrst 200 subjects are for
training and the rest 50 for testing. 300wLP [Zhu et al., 2016]
is augmented from 300W [Sagonas et al., 2013] by the face
proﬁling approach [Zhu et al., 2016], which contains view
labels as well. We employ images with yaw angles ranging
from −60◦ to +60◦, and discretize them into 9 intervals.

For evaluation on unlabeled datasets, we use CelebA [Liu
et al., 2015] and IJB-A [Klare et al., 2015]. CelebA contains
a large amount of celebrity images with unbalanced viewpoint
distributions. Thus, we collect a subset of 72,000 images from
it, which uniformly ranging from −60◦ to +60◦. Notice that
the view labels of the images in CelebA are only utilized to col-
lect the subset, while no view or identity labels are employed
in the training process. We also use IJB-A which contains
5,396 images for evaluation. This dataset is challenging, since
there are extensive identity and pose variations.

Implementation Details. Our network implementation is
modiﬁed from the residual networks in WGAN-GP [Gulrajani
et al., 2017], where E shares a similar network structure with
D. During training, we set v to be a one-hot vector with
9 dimensions and z ∈ [−1, 1]119 in the latent space. The
batch size is 64. Adam optimizer [Kingma and Ba, 2015]
is used with the learning rate of 0.0005 and momentum of
[0, 0.9]. According to the setting of WGAN-GP, we let λ1 =

In each case, the images generated by the two-pathway (Row 2) outperform the ones produced by the single-pathway (Row 1).

more epochs in self-supervised learning.

what it has learned from CelebA to IJB-A. Note that it is our
self-supervised learning approach that makes it possible to
train the network on unlabeled datasets.

4.2 Single-pathway vs. Two-pathway
We compare two-pathway network with the one using a single
reconstruction path. All the networks are trained on Multi-PIE.
When test with Muli-PIE, as shown in Fig. 4 (a), both models
produce desirable results. In each view, facial attributes like
glasses are kept well. However, single-pathway model gets un-
satisfactory results on IJB-A, which is an “unseen” dataset. As
shown in Fig. 4 (b), two-pathway model consistently produce
natural images with more details and fewer artifacts. Instead,
the single-pathway model cannot generate images with good
quality. This result prove that our two-pathway network han-
dles “unseen” data well by learning a complete representation
in the embedding space.

4.3 Supervised vs. Self-supervised Learning
The two-pathway network is employed in the following evalu-
ations. We use Multi-PIE and 300wLP in supervised learning.
For self-supervised learning, in addition to the above datasets,
CelebA is employed as well. Note that we don’t use view or
identity labels in CelebA during training.

Evaluation on CelebA. Fig. 5 shows the results on CelebA.
In Fig. 5 (a), although the supervised model generates favor-
able results, there are artifacts in all views. As the supervised
model is only trained on Multi-PIE and 300wLP, it is difﬁ-
cult to “approximate” the data in the wild. Instead, the self-
supervised model has learned a latent representation where
richer features are embedded, so it generates more realistic
results while the identities are well preserved. We can make
the similar observation in Fig. 5 (b). The supervised model
can only generate images that are similar to Multi-PIE, while
the self-supervised model can generate novel identities. In
Fig. 5 (c) and (d), the self-supervised model preserve identity
and attributes in a better way than others.

Evaluation on IJB-A. Fig. 6 shows more results on IJB-A.
We ﬁnd that our self-supervised model successfully generalize

4.4 Comparison with DR-GAN
Furthermore, we compare our self-supervised CR-GAN with
DR-GAN [Tran et al., 2017]. We replace DC-GAN [Rad-
ford et al., 2016] network architecture used in DR-GAN with
WGAN-GP for a fair comparison.

Evaluation on IJB-A. We show the results of DR-GAN
and CR-GAN in Fig. 6 respectively. DR-GAN produces sharp
images, but the facial identities are not well-kept. By contrast,
in Fig. 6 (a) and (b), CR-GAN produces face images with
similar identities. In all cases, DR-GAN fails to produce high-
quality images with large poses. Although not perfect enough,
CR-GAN can synthesize reasonable proﬁle images.

Identity Similarities on IJB-A. We generate 9 views for
each image in IJB-A both using DR-GAN and CR-GAN. Then
we obtain a 128-dim feature for each view by FaceNet [Schroff
et al., 2015]. We evaluate the identity similarities between
the real and generated images by feeding them to FaceNet.
The squared L2 distances of the features directly correspond-
ing to the face similarity: faces of the same subjects have
small distances, while faces of different subjects have large
distances. Table 1 shows the results of the average L2 dis-
tance of CR-GAN and DR-GAN in different datasets. Our
method outperforms DR-GAN on all datasets, especially on
IJB-A which contains unseen data. Fig. 7 shows the t-SNE
visualization in the embedding space of DR-GAN and CR-
GAN respectively. For clarity, we only visualize 10 randomly
selected subjects along with 9 generated views of each. Com-
pared with DR-GAN, CR-GAN produces tighter clusterings:
multi-view images of the same subject are embedded close to
each other. It means the identities are better preserved.

Generative Ability. We utilize DR-GAN and CR-GAN to
generate images from random noises. In Fig. 8, CR-GAN can
produce images with different styles, while DR-GAN leads to
blurry results. This is because the single-pathway generator of
DR-GAN learns incomplete representations in the embedding

supervised model, DR-GAN [Tran et al., 2017] and our self-supervised model. DR-GAN fails to produce favourable images of large poses,
while our method can synthesize reasonable proﬁle images.

al., 2015]. The same marker shape (color) indicates the same subject.
For CR-GAN, multi-view images of the same subject are embedded
close to each other, which means the identities are better preserved.

produces favorable results with complete embeddings.

4.5 Comparison with BiGAN

To compare our method with BiGAN, we qualitatively show
the image reconstruction results of both methods on CelebA
in Fig. 9. We can ﬁnd that as demonstrated by [Donahue et al.,
2017; Dumoulin et al., 2017], BiGAN cannot reconstruct the
data correctly, while CR-GAN keeps identities well due to the
explicit reconstruction loss we employed.

5 Conclusion

In this paper, we investigate learning “complete representa-
tions” of GAN models. We propose CR-GAN that uses a
two-pathway framework to achieve the goal. Our method can
leverage both labeled and unlabeled data for self-supervised
learning, yielding high-quality multi-view image generations
from even “unseen” data in wild conditions.

Abstract

Generating multi-view images from a single-view
input is an essential yet challenging problem. It has
broad applications in vision, graphics, and robotics.
Our study indicates that the widely-used generative
adversarial network (GAN) may learn “incomplete”
representations due to the single-pathway frame-
work: an encoder-decoder network followed by a
discriminator network. We propose CR-GAN to
address this problem. In addition to the single recon-
struction path, we introduce a generation sideway to
maintain the completeness of the learned embedding
space. The two learning pathways collaborate and
compete in a parameter-sharing manner, yielding
considerably improved generalization ability to “un-
seen” dataset. More importantly, the two-pathway
framework makes it possible to combine both la-
beled and unlabeled data for self-supervised learn-
ing, which further enriches the embedding space
for realistic generations. The experimental results
prove that CR-GAN signiﬁcantly outperforms state-
of-the-art methods, especially when generating from
“unseen” inputs in wild conditions. 1

1 Introduction
Generating multi-view images from a single-view input is an
interesting problem with broad applications in vision, graphics,
and robotics. Yet, it is a challenging problem since 1) comput-
ers need to “imagine” what a given object would look like after
a 3D rotation is applied; and 2) the multi-view generations
should preserve the same “identity”.

Generally speaking, previous solutions to this problem in-
clude model-driven synthesis [Blanz and Vetter, 1999], data-
driven generation [Zhu et al., 2014; Yan et al., 2016], and
a combination of the both [Zhu et al., 2016; Rezende et al.,
2016]. Recently, generative adversarial networks (GANs)
[Goodfellow et al., 2014] have shown impressive results in
multi-view generation [Tran et al., 2017; Zhao et al., 2017].
These GAN-based methods usually have a single-pathway
design: an encoder-decoder network is followed by a discrim-

Figure 1: Top: The limitation of existing GAN-based methods. They
can generate good results if the input is mapped into the learned
subspace (Row 1). However, “unseen” data may be mapped out of
the subspace, leading to poor results (Row 2). Bottom: Our results.
By learning complete representations, the proposed CR-GAN can
generate realistic, identity-preserved images from a single-view input.

inator network. The encoder (E) maps input images into a
latent space (Z), where the embeddings are ﬁrst manipulated
and then fed into the decoder (G) to generate novel views.

However, our experiments indicate that this single-pathway
design may have a severe issue: they can only learn “incom-
plete” representations, yielding limited generalization ability
on “unseen” or unconstrained data. Take Fig. 1 as an example.
During the training, the outputs of E constitute only a sub-
space of Z since we usually have a limited number of training
samples. This would make G only “see” part of Z. During
the testing, it is highly possible that E would map an “unseen”
input outside the subspace. As a result, G may produce poor
results due to the unexpected embedding.

To address this issue, we propose CR-GAN to learn Com-
plete Representations for multi-view generation. The main
idea is, in addition to the reconstruction path, we introduce
another generation path to create view-speciﬁc images from
embeddings that are randomly sampled from Z. Please refer
to Fig. 2 for an illustration. The two paths share the same G.
In other words, G learned in the generation path will guide
the learning of both E and D in the reconstruction path, and
vice versa. E is forced to be an inverse of G, yielding com-
plete representations that would span the entire Z space. More
importantly, the two-pathway learning can easily utilize both
labeled and unlabeled data for self-supervised learning, which

can largely enrich the Z space for natural generations.

To sum up, we have following contributions:

• To the best of our knowledge, we are the ﬁrst to investi-

gate “complete representations” of GAN models;

• We propose CR-GAN that can learn “complete” repre-

sentations, using a two-pathway learning scheme;

• CR-GAN can leverage unlabeled data for self-supervised

learning, yielding improved generation quality;

• CR-GAN can generate high-quality multi-view images

from even “unseen” dataset in wild conditions.

2 Related Work

Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). Goodfellow et
al. [Goodfellow et al., 2014] introduced GAN to estimate
target distribution via an adversarial process. Gulrajani et
al. [Gulrajani et al., 2017] presented a more stable approach to
enforce Lipschitz Constraint on Wasserstein GAN [Arjovsky
et al., 2017]. AC-GAN et al. [Odena et al., 2017] extended the
discriminator by containing an auxiliary decoder network to
estimate class labels for the training data. BiGANs [Donahue
et al., 2017; Dumoulin et al., 2017] try to learn an inverse
mapping to project data back into the latent space. Our method
can also ﬁnd an inverse mapping, make a balanced minimax
game when training data is limited.

Multi-view Synthesis. Hinton et al. [Hinton et al., 2011]
introduced transforming auto-encoder to generate images with
view variance. Yan et al. [Yan et al., 2016] proposed Perspec-
tive Transformer Nets to ﬁnd the projection transformation.
Zhou et al. [Zhou et al., 2016] propose to synthesize views
by appearance ﬂow. Very recently, GAN-based methods usu-
ally follow a single-pathway design: an encoder-decoder net-
work [Peng et al., 2016] followed by a discriminator network.
For example, to normalize the viewpoint, e.g. face frontaliza-
tion, they either combine encoder-decoder with 3DMM [Blanz
and Vetter, 1999] parameters [Yin et al., 2017], or use dupli-
cates to predict global and local details [Huang et al., 2017].
DR-GAN [Tran et al., 2017] follows the single-pathway frame-
work to learn identity features that are invariant to viewpoints.
However, it may learn “incomplete” representations due to the
single-pathway framework. In contrast, CR-GAN can learn
complete representations using a two-pathway network, which
guarantees high-quality generations even for “unseen” inputs.
Pose-Invariant Representation Learning. For represen-
tation learning [Li et al., 2016; Fan et al., 2016], early works
may use Canonical Correlation Analysis to analyze the com-
monality among different pose subspaces [Hardoon et al.,
2004; Peng et al., 2015]. Recently, deep learning based
methods use synthesized images to disentangle pose and
identity factors by cross-reconstruction [Zhu et al., 2014;
Peng et al., 2017], or transfer information from pose variant
inputs to a frontalized appearance [Zhu et al., 2013]. However,
they usually use only labeled data, leading to a limited perfor-
mance. We proposed a two-pathway network to leverage both
labeled and unlabeled data for self-supervised learning, which
can generate realistic images in challenging conditions.

Figure 2: Left: Previous methods use a single path to learn the
latent representation, but it is incomplete in the whole space. Right:
We propose a two-pathway network combined with self-supervised
learning, which can learn complete representations.

3 Proposed Method
3.1 A Toy Example of Incomplete Representations
A single-pathway network, i.e. an encoder-decoder network
followed by a discriminator network, may have the issue of
learning “incomplete” representations. As illustrated in Fig. 2
left, the encoder E and decoder G can “touch” only a subspace
of Z since we usually have a limited number of training data.
This would lead to a severe issue in testing when using “un-
seen” data as the input. It is highly possible that E may map
the novel input out of the subspace, which inevitably leads to
poor generations since G has never “seen” the embedding.

A toy example is used to explain this point. We use Multi-
PIE [Gross et al., 2010] to train a single-pathway network. As
shown in the top of Fig. 1, the network can generate realistic
results on Multi-PIE (the ﬁrst row), as long as the input image
is mapped into the learned subspace. However, when testing
“unseen” images from IJB-A [Klare et al., 2015], the network
may produce unsatisfactory results (the second row). In this
case, the new image is mapped out of the learned subspace.

This fact motivates us to train E and G that can “cover” the
whole Z space, so we can learn complete representations. We
achieve this goal by introducing a separate generation path,
where the generator focuses on mapping the entire Z space to
high-quality images. Fig. 2 illustrates the comparison between
the single-pathway and two-pathway networks. Please refer to
Fig. 3 (d) for an overview of our approach.

3.2 Generation Path
The generation path trains generator G and discriminator D.
Here the encoder E is not involved since G tries to generate
from random noise. Given a view label v and random noise
z, G aims to produce a realistic image G(v, z) under view v.
D is trying to distinguish real data from G’s output, which
minimizes:

E
z∼Pz

[Ds(G(v, z))] − E

[Ds(x)]+

x∼Px

x∼Px

ˆx∼Pˆx

[P (Dv(x) = v)],

(1)

where Px is the data distribution and Pz is the noise uniform
distribution, Pˆx is an interpolation between pairs of points
sampled from data distribution and the generator distribu-
tion [Gulrajani et al., 2017]. G tries to fool D, it maximizes:

E
z∼Pz

[Ds(G(v, z))] + λ3 E
z∼Pz
where (Dv(·), Ds(·)) = D(·) denotes pairwise outputs of
the discriminator. Dv(·) estimates the probability of being a

speciﬁc view, Ds(·) describes the image quality, i.e., how real
the image is. Note that in Eq. 1, D learns how to estimate the
correct view of a real image [Odena et al., 2017], while G
tries to produce an image with that view in order to get a high
score from D in Eq. 2.

3.3 Reconstruction Path
The reconstruction path trains E and D but keeping G ﬁxed.
E tries to reconstruct training samples, this would guarantee
that E will be learned as an inverse of G, yielding complete
representations in the latent embedding space.

The output of E should be identity-preserved so the multi-
view images will present the same identity. We propose a
cross reconstruction task to make E disentangle the viewpoint
from the identity. More speciﬁcally, we sample a real image
pair (xi, xj) that share the same identity but different views
vi and vj. The goal is to reconstruct xj from xi. To achieve
this, E takes xi as input and outputs an identity-preserved
representation ¯z together with the view estimation ¯v: (¯v, ¯z) =
(Ev(xi), Ez(xi)) = E(xi). Note that ¯v is learned for further
self-supervised training as shown in Sec. 3.4.

G takes ¯z and view vj as the input. As ¯z is expected to carry
the identity information of this person, with view vj’s help, G
should produce ˜xj, the reconstruction of xj. D is trained to
distinguish the fake image ˜xj from the real one xi. Thus D
minimizes:

E
xi,xj ∼Px

[Ds(˜xj) − Ds(xi)]+

[((cid:107)(cid:53)ˆxD(ˆx)(cid:107)2 − 1)2] − λ2 E

[P (Dv(xi) = vi)],

xi∼Px

where ˜xj = G(vj, Ez(xi)). E helps G to generate high
quality image with view vj, so E maximizes:

E
xi,xj ∼Px

[Ds(˜xj) + λ3P (Dv(˜xj) = vj)−

λ4L1(˜xj, xj) − λ5Lv(Ev(xi), vi)],

(3)

(4)

where L1 loss is utilized to enforce that ˜xj is the reconstruction
of xj. Lv is the cross-entropy loss of estimated and ground
truth views, to let E be a good view estimator.

The two-pathway network learns complete representations:
First, in the generation path, G learns how to produce real

end

end

end

images from any inputs in the latent space. Then, in the
reconstruction path, G retains the generative ability since it
keeps unchanged. The alternative training details of the two
pathways are summarized in Algorithm 1.
3.4 Self-supervised Learning
Labeled datasets are usually limited and biased. For example,
Multi-PIE [Gross et al., 2010] is collected in a constrained set-
ting, while large-pose images in 300wLP [Zhu et al., 2016] are
distorted. As a result, G would generate low-quality images
since it has only “seen” poor and limited examples.

To solve this issue, we further improve the proposed CR-
GAN with self-supervised learning. The key idea is to use a
pre-trained model to estimate viewpoints for unlabeled images.
Accordingly, we modify the supervised training algorithm
into two phases. In the ﬁrst stage, we pre-train the network
on labeled data to let E be a good view estimator. In the
second stage, both labeled and unlabeled data are utilized to
boost G. When an unlabeled image x is fed to the network,
a view estimation ¯v is obtained by Ev(·). Denote ˆv to be the
closest one-hot vector of ¯v, in the reconstruction path, we let
E minimize Lv(¯v, ˆv) and then reconstruct x to itself. Similar
to Eq. 3, D minimizes:

E
x∼Px

[Ds(G(ˆv, Ez(x))) − Ds(x)]+

λ1 E

ˆx∼Pˆx

[((cid:107)(cid:53)ˆxD(ˆx)(cid:107)2 − 1)2] − λ2 E
x∼Px

[P (Dv(x) = ˆv)],

similar to Eq. 4, E maximizes:

E
x∼Px

[Ds(G(ˆv, Ez(x))) + λ3P (Dv(G(ˆv, Ez(x))) = ˆv)−

λ4L1(G(ˆv, Ez(x)), x) − λ5Lv(Ev(x), ˆv)].
In the generation path, we let ˆv be the ground truth of x, and
generate an image in view ˆv. So similar to Eq. 1, D minimizes:

E
z∼Pz

[Ds(G(ˆv, z))] − E

[Ds(x)]+

x∼Px
[((cid:107)(cid:53)ˆxD(ˆx)(cid:107)2 − 1)2] − λ2 E
x∼Px

λ1 E

ˆx∼Pˆx

[P (Dv(x) = ˆv)],

Figure 3: Comparison of BiGAN [Donahue et al., 2017], DR-GAN [Tran et al., 2017], TP-GAN [Huang et al., 2017] and our method.

similar to Eq. 2, G maximizes:

E
z∼Pz

[Ds(G(ˆv, z))] + λ3 E
z∼Pz

[P (Dv(G(z)) = ˆv)].

(8)

Once we get the pre-trained model, the encoder E predicts
the probabilities of the input image belonging to different
views. We choose the view with the highest probability as the
estimation. Our strategy is similar to RANSAC algorithm [Fis-
chler and Bolles, 1981], where we treat the estimations with
higher conﬁdence as “inliers” and use them to make view es-
timation more accurate. We summarize the self-supervised
training in Algorithm 2.

Compared with the single-pathway solution, the proposed
two-pathway network boosts the self-supervised learning in
two aspects: 1) it provides a better pre-trained model for
viewpoint estimation as a byproduct; and 2) it guarantees that
we can take full advantage of unlabeled data in training since
CR-GAN learns complete representations.

3.5 Discussion
To highlight the novelty of our method, we compare CR-GAN
with the following three GANs.
In Fig. 3, we show their
network structures as well as ours for visual comparison.

BiGAN [Donahue et al., 2017; Dumoulin et al., 2017]
jointly learns a generation network G and an inference net-
work E. The authors proved that E is an inverse network of
G. However, in practice, BiGAN produces poor reconstruc-
tions due to ﬁnite data and limited network capacity. Instead,
CR-GAN uses explicit reconstruction loss to solve this issue.
DR-GAN [Tran et al., 2017] also tries to learn an identity
preserved representation to synthesize multi-view images. But
we have two distinct differences. First, the output of its en-
coder, also acts as the decoder’s input, completely depends
on the training dataset. Therefore, it can not deal with new
data. Instead, we use the generation path to make sure that
the learning of our G is “complete”. Second, we don’t let
D estimate the identity for training data, because we employ
unlabeled dataset in self-supervised learning which has no
identity information. The involvement of unlabeled dataset
also makes our model more robust for “unseen” data.

TP-GAN [Huang et al., 2017] uses two pathway GANs for
frontal view synthesis. Their framework is different from ours:
First, they use two distinct encoder-decoder networks, while
CR-GAN shares all modules in the two pathways. Besides,

they use two pathways to capture global features and local
details, while we focus on learning complete representations
in multi-view generation.

4 Experiments
CR-GAN aims to learn complete representations in the em-
bedding space. We achieve this goal by combining the two-
pathway architecture with self-supervised learning. We con-
duct experiments to evaluate these two contributions respec-
tively. Then we compare our CR-GAN with DR-GAN [Tran
et al., 2017], both the visual results and t-SNE visualization in
the embedding space are shown. We also compare CR-GAN
and BiGAN with an image reconstruction task.

4.1 Experimental Settings
Datasets. We evaluate CR-GAN on datasets with and without
view labels. Multi-PIE [Gross et al., 2010] is a labeled dataset
collected under constrained environment. We use 250 subjects
from the ﬁrst session with 9 poses within ±60◦, 20 illumi-
nations, and two expressions. The ﬁrst 200 subjects are for
training and the rest 50 for testing. 300wLP [Zhu et al., 2016]
is augmented from 300W [Sagonas et al., 2013] by the face
proﬁling approach [Zhu et al., 2016], which contains view
labels as well. We employ images with yaw angles ranging
from −60◦ to +60◦, and discretize them into 9 intervals.

For evaluation on unlabeled datasets, we use CelebA [Liu
et al., 2015] and IJB-A [Klare et al., 2015]. CelebA contains
a large amount of celebrity images with unbalanced viewpoint
distributions. Thus, we collect a subset of 72,000 images from
it, which uniformly ranging from −60◦ to +60◦. Notice that
the view labels of the images in CelebA are only utilized to col-
lect the subset, while no view or identity labels are employed
in the training process. We also use IJB-A which contains
5,396 images for evaluation. This dataset is challenging, since
there are extensive identity and pose variations.

Implementation Details. Our network implementation is
modiﬁed from the residual networks in WGAN-GP [Gulrajani
et al., 2017], where E shares a similar network structure with
D. During training, we set v to be a one-hot vector with
9 dimensions and z ∈ [−1, 1]119 in the latent space. The
batch size is 64. Adam optimizer [Kingma and Ba, 2015]
is used with the learning rate of 0.0005 and momentum of
[0, 0.9]. According to the setting of WGAN-GP, we let λ1 =

In each case, the images generated by the two-pathway (Row 2) outperform the ones produced by the single-pathway (Row 1).

what it has learned from CelebA to IJB-A. Note that it is our
self-supervised learning approach that makes it possible to
train the network on unlabeled datasets.

4.2 Single-pathway vs. Two-pathway
We compare two-pathway network with the one using a single
reconstruction path. All the networks are trained on Multi-PIE.
When test with Muli-PIE, as shown in Fig. 4 (a), both models
produce desirable results. In each view, facial attributes like
glasses are kept well. However, single-pathway model gets un-
satisfactory results on IJB-A, which is an “unseen” dataset. As
shown in Fig. 4 (b), two-pathway model consistently produce
natural images with more details and fewer artifacts. Instead,
the single-pathway model cannot generate images with good
quality. This result prove that our two-pathway network han-
dles “unseen” data well by learning a complete representation
in the embedding space.

4.3 Supervised vs. Self-supervised Learning
The two-pathway network is employed in the following evalu-
ations. We use Multi-PIE and 300wLP in supervised learning.
For self-supervised learning, in addition to the above datasets,
CelebA is employed as well. Note that we don’t use view or
identity labels in CelebA during training.

Evaluation on CelebA. Fig. 5 shows the results on CelebA.
In Fig. 5 (a), although the supervised model generates favor-
able results, there are artifacts in all views. As the supervised
model is only trained on Multi-PIE and 300wLP, it is difﬁ-
cult to “approximate” the data in the wild. Instead, the self-
supervised model has learned a latent representation where
richer features are embedded, so it generates more realistic
results while the identities are well preserved. We can make
the similar observation in Fig. 5 (b). The supervised model
can only generate images that are similar to Multi-PIE, while
the self-supervised model can generate novel identities. In
Fig. 5 (c) and (d), the self-supervised model preserve identity
and attributes in a better way than others.

Evaluation on IJB-A. Fig. 6 shows more results on IJB-A.
We ﬁnd that our self-supervised model successfully generalize

4.4 Comparison with DR-GAN
Furthermore, we compare our self-supervised CR-GAN with
DR-GAN [Tran et al., 2017]. We replace DC-GAN [Rad-
ford et al., 2016] network architecture used in DR-GAN with
WGAN-GP for a fair comparison.

Evaluation on IJB-A. We show the results of DR-GAN
and CR-GAN in Fig. 6 respectively. DR-GAN produces sharp
images, but the facial identities are not well-kept. By contrast,
in Fig. 6 (a) and (b), CR-GAN produces face images with
similar identities. In all cases, DR-GAN fails to produce high-
quality images with large poses. Although not perfect enough,
CR-GAN can synthesize reasonable proﬁle images.

Identity Similarities on IJB-A. We generate 9 views for
each image in IJB-A both using DR-GAN and CR-GAN. Then
we obtain a 128-dim feature for each view by FaceNet [Schroff
et al., 2015]. We evaluate the identity similarities between
the real and generated images by feeding them to FaceNet.
The squared L2 distances of the features directly correspond-
ing to the face similarity: faces of the same subjects have
small distances, while faces of different subjects have large
distances. Table 1 shows the results of the average L2 dis-
tance of CR-GAN and DR-GAN in different datasets. Our
method outperforms DR-GAN on all datasets, especially on
IJB-A which contains unseen data. Fig. 7 shows the t-SNE
visualization in the embedding space of DR-GAN and CR-
GAN respectively. For clarity, we only visualize 10 randomly
selected subjects along with 9 generated views of each. Com-
pared with DR-GAN, CR-GAN produces tighter clusterings:
multi-view images of the same subject are embedded close to
each other. It means the identities are better preserved.

Generative Ability. We utilize DR-GAN and CR-GAN to
generate images from random noises. In Fig. 8, CR-GAN can
produce images with different styles, while DR-GAN leads to
blurry results. This is because the single-pathway generator of
DR-GAN learns incomplete representations in the embedding

supervised model, DR-GAN [Tran et al., 2017] and our self-supervised model. DR-GAN fails to produce favourable images of large poses,
while our method can synthesize reasonable proﬁle images.

al., 2015]. The same marker shape (color) indicates the same subject.
For CR-GAN, multi-view images of the same subject are embedded
close to each other, which means the identities are better preserved.

produces favorable results with complete embeddings.

4.5 Comparison with BiGAN

To compare our method with BiGAN, we qualitatively show
the image reconstruction results of both methods on CelebA
in Fig. 9. We can ﬁnd that as demonstrated by [Donahue et al.,
2017; Dumoulin et al., 2017], BiGAN cannot reconstruct the
data correctly, while CR-GAN keeps identities well due to the
explicit reconstruction loss we employed.

5 Conclusion

In this paper, we investigate learning “complete representa-
tions” of GAN models. We propose CR-GAN that uses a
two-pathway framework to achieve the goal. Our method can
leverage both labeled and unlabeled data for self-supervised
learning, yielding high-quality multi-view image generations
from even “unseen” data in wild conditions.

Abstract

Generating multi-view images from a single-view
input is an essential yet challenging problem. It has
broad applications in vision, graphics, and robotics.
Our study indicates that the widely-used generative
adversarial network (GAN) may learn “incomplete”
representations due to the single-pathway frame-
work: an encoder-decoder network followed by a
discriminator network. We propose CR-GAN to
address this problem. In addition to the single recon-
struction path, we introduce a generation sideway to
maintain the completeness of the learned embedding
space. The two learning pathways collaborate and
compete in a parameter-sharing manner, yielding
considerably improved generalization ability to “un-
seen” dataset. More importantly, the two-pathway
framework makes it possible to combine both la-
beled and unlabeled data for self-supervised learn-
ing, which further enriches the embedding space
for realistic generations. The experimental results
prove that CR-GAN signiﬁcantly outperforms state-
of-the-art methods, especially when generating from
“unseen” inputs in wild conditions. 1

1 Introduction
Generating multi-view images from a single-view input is an
interesting problem with broad applications in vision, graphics,
and robotics. Yet, it is a challenging problem since 1) comput-
ers need to “imagine” what a given object would look like after
a 3D rotation is applied; and 2) the multi-view generations
should preserve the same “identity”.

Generally speaking, previous solutions to this problem in-
clude model-driven synthesis [Blanz and Vetter, 1999], data-
driven generation [Zhu et al., 2014; Yan et al., 2016], and
a combination of the both [Zhu et al., 2016; Rezende et al.,
2016]. Recently, generative adversarial networks (GANs)
[Goodfellow et al., 2014] have shown impressive results in
multi-view generation [Tran et al., 2017; Zhao et al., 2017].
These GAN-based methods usually have a single-pathway
design: an encoder-decoder network is followed by a discrim-

Figure 1: Top: The limitation of existing GAN-based methods. They
can generate good results if the input is mapped into the learned
subspace (Row 1). However, “unseen” data may be mapped out of
the subspace, leading to poor results (Row 2). Bottom: Our results.
By learning complete representations, the proposed CR-GAN can
generate realistic, identity-preserved images from a single-view input.

inator network. The encoder (E) maps input images into a
latent space (Z), where the embeddings are ﬁrst manipulated
and then fed into the decoder (G) to generate novel views.

However, our experiments indicate that this single-pathway
design may have a severe issue: they can only learn “incom-
plete” representations, yielding limited generalization ability
on “unseen” or unconstrained data. Take Fig. 1 as an example.
During the training, the outputs of E constitute only a sub-
space of Z since we usually have a limited number of training
samples. This would make G only “see” part of Z. During
the testing, it is highly possible that E would map an “unseen”
input outside the subspace. As a result, G may produce poor
results due to the unexpected embedding.

To address this issue, we propose CR-GAN to learn Com-
plete Representations for multi-view generation. The main
idea is, in addition to the reconstruction path, we introduce
another generation path to create view-speciﬁc images from
embeddings that are randomly sampled from Z. Please refer
to Fig. 2 for an illustration. The two paths share the same G.
In other words, G learned in the generation path will guide
the learning of both E and D in the reconstruction path, and
vice versa. E is forced to be an inverse of G, yielding com-
plete representations that would span the entire Z space. More
importantly, the two-pathway learning can easily utilize both
labeled and unlabeled data for self-supervised learning, which

can largely enrich the Z space for natural generations.

To sum up, we have following contributions:

• To the best of our knowledge, we are the ﬁrst to investi-

gate “complete representations” of GAN models;

• We propose CR-GAN that can learn “complete” repre-

sentations, using a two-pathway learning scheme;

• CR-GAN can leverage unlabeled data for self-supervised

learning, yielding improved generation quality;

• CR-GAN can generate high-quality multi-view images

from even “unseen” dataset in wild conditions.

2 Related Work

Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). Goodfellow et
al. [Goodfellow et al., 2014] introduced GAN to estimate
target distribution via an adversarial process. Gulrajani et
al. [Gulrajani et al., 2017] presented a more stable approach to
enforce Lipschitz Constraint on Wasserstein GAN [Arjovsky
et al., 2017]. AC-GAN et al. [Odena et al., 2017] extended the
discriminator by containing an auxiliary decoder network to
estimate class labels for the training data. BiGANs [Donahue
et al., 2017; Dumoulin et al., 2017] try to learn an inverse
mapping to project data back into the latent space. Our method
can also ﬁnd an inverse mapping, make a balanced minimax
game when training data is limited.

Multi-view Synthesis. Hinton et al. [Hinton et al., 2011]
introduced transforming auto-encoder to generate images with
view variance. Yan et al. [Yan et al., 2016] proposed Perspec-
tive Transformer Nets to ﬁnd the projection transformation.
Zhou et al. [Zhou et al., 2016] propose to synthesize views
by appearance ﬂow. Very recently, GAN-based methods usu-
ally follow a single-pathway design: an encoder-decoder net-
work [Peng et al., 2016] followed by a discriminator network.
For example, to normalize the viewpoint, e.g. face frontaliza-
tion, they either combine encoder-decoder with 3DMM [Blanz
and Vetter, 1999] parameters [Yin et al., 2017], or use dupli-
cates to predict global and local details [Huang et al., 2017].
DR-GAN [Tran et al., 2017] follows the single-pathway frame-
work to learn identity features that are invariant to viewpoints.
However, it may learn “incomplete” representations due to the
single-pathway framework. In contrast, CR-GAN can learn
complete representations using a two-pathway network, which
guarantees high-quality generations even for “unseen” inputs.
Pose-Invariant Representation Learning. For represen-
tation learning [Li et al., 2016; Fan et al., 2016], early works
may use Canonical Correlation Analysis to analyze the com-
monality among different pose subspaces [Hardoon et al.,
2004; Peng et al., 2015]. Recently, deep learning based
methods use synthesized images to disentangle pose and
identity factors by cross-reconstruction [Zhu et al., 2014;
Peng et al., 2017], or transfer information from pose variant
inputs to a frontalized appearance [Zhu et al., 2013]. However,
they usually use only labeled data, leading to a limited perfor-
mance. We proposed a two-pathway network to leverage both
labeled and unlabeled data for self-supervised learning, which
can generate realistic images in challenging conditions.

Figure 2: Left: Previous methods use a single path to learn the
latent representation, but it is incomplete in the whole space. Right:
We propose a two-pathway network combined with self-supervised
learning, which can learn complete representations.

3 Proposed Method
3.1 A Toy Example of Incomplete Representations
A single-pathway network, i.e. an encoder-decoder network
followed by a discriminator network, may have the issue of
learning “incomplete” representations. As illustrated in Fig. 2
left, the encoder E and decoder G can “touch” only a subspace
of Z since we usually have a limited number of training data.
This would lead to a severe issue in testing when using “un-
seen” data as the input. It is highly possible that E may map
the novel input out of the subspace, which inevitably leads to
poor generations since G has never “seen” the embedding.

A toy example is used to explain this point. We use Multi-
PIE [Gross et al., 2010] to train a single-pathway network. As
shown in the top of Fig. 1, the network can generate realistic
results on Multi-PIE (the ﬁrst row), as long as the input image
is mapped into the learned subspace. However, when testing
“unseen” images from IJB-A [Klare et al., 2015], the network
may produce unsatisfactory results (the second row). In this
case, the new image is mapped out of the learned subspace.

This fact motivates us to train E and G that can “cover” the
whole Z space, so we can learn complete representations. We
achieve this goal by introducing a separate generation path,
where the generator focuses on mapping the entire Z space to
high-quality images. Fig. 2 illustrates the comparison between
the single-pathway and two-pathway networks. Please refer to
Fig. 3 (d) for an overview of our approach.

3.2 Generation Path
The generation path trains generator G and discriminator D.
Here the encoder E is not involved since G tries to generate
from random noise. Given a view label v and random noise
z, G aims to produce a realistic image G(v, z) under view v.
D is trying to distinguish real data from G’s output, which
minimizes:

E
z∼Pz

[Ds(G(v, z))] − E

[Ds(x)]+

x∼Px

[P (Dv(x) = v)],

(1)

where Px is the data distribution and Pz is the noise uniform
distribution, Pˆx is an interpolation between pairs of points
sampled from data distribution and the generator distribu-
tion [Gulrajani et al., 2017]. G tries to fool D, it maximizes:

E

[Ds(G(v, z))] + λ3 E

where (Dv(·), Ds(·)) = D(·) denotes pairwise outputs of
the discriminator. Dv(·) estimates the probability of being a

share the same identity);

end

speciﬁc view, Ds(·) describes the image quality, i.e., how real
the image is. Note that in Eq. 1, D learns how to estimate the
correct view of a real image [Odena et al., 2017], while G
tries to produce an image with that view in order to get a high
score from D in Eq. 2.

3.3 Reconstruction Path
The reconstruction path trains E and D but keeping G ﬁxed.
E tries to reconstruct training samples, this would guarantee
that E will be learned as an inverse of G, yielding complete
representations in the latent embedding space.

The output of E should be identity-preserved so the multi-
view images will present the same identity. We propose a
cross reconstruction task to make E disentangle the viewpoint
from the identity. More speciﬁcally, we sample a real image
pair (xi, xj) that share the same identity but different views
vi and vj. The goal is to reconstruct xj from xi. To achieve
this, E takes xi as input and outputs an identity-preserved
representation ¯z together with the view estimation ¯v: (¯v, ¯z) =
(Ev(xi), Ez(xi)) = E(xi). Note that ¯v is learned for further
self-supervised training as shown in Sec. 3.4.

G takes ¯z and view vj as the input. As ¯z is expected to carry
the identity information of this person, with view vj’s help, G
should produce ˜xj, the reconstruction of xj. D is trained to
distinguish the fake image ˜xj from the real one xi. Thus D
minimizes:

E
xi,xj ∼Px

[Ds(˜xj) − Ds(xi)]+

ˆx∼Pˆx

[((cid:107)(cid:53)ˆxD(ˆx)(cid:107)2 − 1)2] − λ2 E

[P (Dv(xi) = vi)],

xi∼Px

where ˜xj = G(vj, Ez(xi)). E helps G to generate high
quality image with view vj, so E maximizes:

E
xi,xj ∼Px

[Ds(˜xj) + λ3P (Dv(˜xj) = vj)−

λ4L1(˜xj, xj) − λ5Lv(Ev(xi), vi)],

where L1 loss is utilized to enforce that ˜xj is the reconstruction
of xj. Lv is the cross-entropy loss of estimated and ground
truth views, to let E be a good view estimator.

images from any inputs in the latent space. Then, in the
reconstruction path, G retains the generative ability since it
keeps unchanged. The alternative training details of the two
pathways are summarized in Algorithm 1.
3.4 Self-supervised Learning
Labeled datasets are usually limited and biased. For example,
Multi-PIE [Gross et al., 2010] is collected in a constrained set-
ting, while large-pose images in 300wLP [Zhu et al., 2016] are
distorted. As a result, G would generate low-quality images
since it has only “seen” poor and limited examples.

To solve this issue, we further improve the proposed CR-
GAN with self-supervised learning. The key idea is to use a
pre-trained model to estimate viewpoints for unlabeled images.
Accordingly, we modify the supervised training algorithm
into two phases. In the ﬁrst stage, we pre-train the network
on labeled data to let E be a good view estimator. In the
second stage, both labeled and unlabeled data are utilized to
boost G. When an unlabeled image x is fed to the network,
a view estimation ¯v is obtained by Ev(·). Denote ˆv to be the
closest one-hot vector of ¯v, in the reconstruction path, we let
E minimize Lv(¯v, ˆv) and then reconstruct x to itself. Similar
to Eq. 3, D minimizes:

E
x∼Px

[Ds(G(ˆv, Ez(x))) − Ds(x)]+

λ1 E

ˆx∼Pˆx

[((cid:107)(cid:53)ˆxD(ˆx)(cid:107)2 − 1)2] − λ2 E
x∼Px

[P (Dv(x) = ˆv)],

similar to Eq. 4, E maximizes:

E
x∼Px

[Ds(G(ˆv, Ez(x))) + λ3P (Dv(G(ˆv, Ez(x))) = ˆv)−

λ4L1(G(ˆv, Ez(x)), x) − λ5Lv(Ev(x), ˆv)].
In the generation path, we let ˆv be the ground truth of x, and
generate an image in view ˆv. So similar to Eq. 1, D minimizes:

E
z∼Pz

[Ds(G(ˆv, z))] − E

[Ds(x)]+

x∼Px

similar to Eq. 2, G maximizes:

E

Once we get the pre-trained model, the encoder E predicts
the probabilities of the input image belonging to different
views. We choose the view with the highest probability as the
estimation. Our strategy is similar to RANSAC algorithm [Fis-
chler and Bolles, 1981], where we treat the estimations with
higher conﬁdence as “inliers” and use them to make view es-
timation more accurate. We summarize the self-supervised
training in Algorithm 2.

Compared with the single-pathway solution, the proposed
two-pathway network boosts the self-supervised learning in
two aspects: 1) it provides a better pre-trained model for
viewpoint estimation as a byproduct; and 2) it guarantees that
we can take full advantage of unlabeled data in training since
CR-GAN learns complete representations.

3.5 Discussion
To highlight the novelty of our method, we compare CR-GAN
with the following three GANs.
In Fig. 3, we show their
network structures as well as ours for visual comparison.

BiGAN [Donahue et al., 2017; Dumoulin et al., 2017]
jointly learns a generation network G and an inference net-
work E. The authors proved that E is an inverse network of
G. However, in practice, BiGAN produces poor reconstruc-
tions due to ﬁnite data and limited network capacity. Instead,
CR-GAN uses explicit reconstruction loss to solve this issue.
DR-GAN [Tran et al., 2017] also tries to learn an identity
preserved representation to synthesize multi-view images. But
we have two distinct differences. First, the output of its en-
coder, also acts as the decoder’s input, completely depends
on the training dataset. Therefore, it can not deal with new
data. Instead, we use the generation path to make sure that
the learning of our G is “complete”. Second, we don’t let
D estimate the identity for training data, because we employ
unlabeled dataset in self-supervised learning which has no
identity information. The involvement of unlabeled dataset
also makes our model more robust for “unseen” data.

TP-GAN [Huang et al., 2017] uses two pathway GANs for
frontal view synthesis. Their framework is different from ours:
First, they use two distinct encoder-decoder networks, while
CR-GAN shares all modules in the two pathways. Besides,

they use two pathways to capture global features and local
details, while we focus on learning complete representations
in multi-view generation.

4 Experiments
CR-GAN aims to learn complete representations in the em-
bedding space. We achieve this goal by combining the two-
pathway architecture with self-supervised learning. We con-
duct experiments to evaluate these two contributions respec-
tively. Then we compare our CR-GAN with DR-GAN [Tran
et al., 2017], both the visual results and t-SNE visualization in
the embedding space are shown. We also compare CR-GAN
and BiGAN with an image reconstruction task.

4.1 Experimental Settings
Datasets. We evaluate CR-GAN on datasets with and without
view labels. Multi-PIE [Gross et al., 2010] is a labeled dataset
collected under constrained environment. We use 250 subjects
from the ﬁrst session with 9 poses within ±60◦, 20 illumi-
nations, and two expressions. The ﬁrst 200 subjects are for
training and the rest 50 for testing. 300wLP [Zhu et al., 2016]
is augmented from 300W [Sagonas et al., 2013] by the face
proﬁling approach [Zhu et al., 2016], which contains view
labels as well. We employ images with yaw angles ranging
from −60◦ to +60◦, and discretize them into 9 intervals.

For evaluation on unlabeled datasets, we use CelebA [Liu
et al., 2015] and IJB-A [Klare et al., 2015]. CelebA contains
a large amount of celebrity images with unbalanced viewpoint
distributions. Thus, we collect a subset of 72,000 images from
it, which uniformly ranging from −60◦ to +60◦. Notice that
the view labels of the images in CelebA are only utilized to col-
lect the subset, while no view or identity labels are employed
in the training process. We also use IJB-A which contains
5,396 images for evaluation. This dataset is challenging, since
there are extensive identity and pose variations.

Implementation Details. Our network implementation is
modiﬁed from the residual networks in WGAN-GP [Gulrajani
et al., 2017], where E shares a similar network structure with
D. During training, we set v to be a one-hot vector with
9 dimensions and z ∈ [−1, 1]119 in the latent space. The
batch size is 64. Adam optimizer [Kingma and Ba, 2015]
is used with the learning rate of 0.0005 and momentum of
[0, 0.9]. According to the setting of WGAN-GP, we let λ1 =

In each case, the images generated by the two-pathway (Row 2) outperform the ones produced by the single-pathway (Row 1).

more epochs in self-supervised learning.

what it has learned from CelebA to IJB-A. Note that it is our
self-supervised learning approach that makes it possible to
train the network on unlabeled datasets.

4.2 Single-pathway vs. Two-pathway
We compare two-pathway network with the one using a single
reconstruction path. All the networks are trained on Multi-PIE.
When test with Muli-PIE, as shown in Fig. 4 (a), both models
produce desirable results. In each view, facial attributes like
glasses are kept well. However, single-pathway model gets un-
satisfactory results on IJB-A, which is an “unseen” dataset. As
shown in Fig. 4 (b), two-pathway model consistently produce
natural images with more details and fewer artifacts. Instead,
the single-pathway model cannot generate images with good
quality. This result prove that our two-pathway network han-
dles “unseen” data well by learning a complete representation
in the embedding space.

4.3 Supervised vs. Self-supervised Learning
The two-pathway network is employed in the following evalu-
ations. We use Multi-PIE and 300wLP in supervised learning.
For self-supervised learning, in addition to the above datasets,
CelebA is employed as well. Note that we don’t use view or
identity labels in CelebA during training.

Evaluation on CelebA. Fig. 5 shows the results on CelebA.
In Fig. 5 (a), although the supervised model generates favor-
able results, there are artifacts in all views. As the supervised
model is only trained on Multi-PIE and 300wLP, it is difﬁ-
cult to “approximate” the data in the wild. Instead, the self-
supervised model has learned a latent representation where
richer features are embedded, so it generates more realistic
results while the identities are well preserved. We can make
the similar observation in Fig. 5 (b). The supervised model
can only generate images that are similar to Multi-PIE, while
the self-supervised model can generate novel identities. In
Fig. 5 (c) and (d), the self-supervised model preserve identity
and attributes in a better way than others.

Evaluation on IJB-A. Fig. 6 shows more results on IJB-A.
We ﬁnd that our self-supervised model successfully generalize

4.4 Comparison with DR-GAN
Furthermore, we compare our self-supervised CR-GAN with
DR-GAN [Tran et al., 2017]. We replace DC-GAN [Rad-
ford et al., 2016] network architecture used in DR-GAN with
WGAN-GP for a fair comparison.

Evaluation on IJB-A. We show the results of DR-GAN
and CR-GAN in Fig. 6 respectively. DR-GAN produces sharp
images, but the facial identities are not well-kept. By contrast,
in Fig. 6 (a) and (b), CR-GAN produces face images with
similar identities. In all cases, DR-GAN fails to produce high-
quality images with large poses. Although not perfect enough,
CR-GAN can synthesize reasonable proﬁle images.

Identity Similarities on IJB-A. We generate 9 views for
each image in IJB-A both using DR-GAN and CR-GAN. Then
we obtain a 128-dim feature for each view by FaceNet [Schroff
et al., 2015]. We evaluate the identity similarities between
the real and generated images by feeding them to FaceNet.
The squared L2 distances of the features directly correspond-
ing to the face similarity: faces of the same subjects have
small distances, while faces of different subjects have large
distances. Table 1 shows the results of the average L2 dis-
tance of CR-GAN and DR-GAN in different datasets. Our
method outperforms DR-GAN on all datasets, especially on
IJB-A which contains unseen data. Fig. 7 shows the t-SNE
visualization in the embedding space of DR-GAN and CR-
GAN respectively. For clarity, we only visualize 10 randomly
selected subjects along with 9 generated views of each. Com-
pared with DR-GAN, CR-GAN produces tighter clusterings:
multi-view images of the same subject are embedded close to
each other. It means the identities are better preserved.

Generative Ability. We utilize DR-GAN and CR-GAN to
generate images from random noises. In Fig. 8, CR-GAN can
produce images with different styles, while DR-GAN leads to
blurry results. This is because the single-pathway generator of
DR-GAN learns incomplete representations in the embedding

supervised model, DR-GAN [Tran et al., 2017] and our self-supervised model. DR-GAN fails to produce favourable images of large poses,
while our method can synthesize reasonable proﬁle images.

al., 2015]. The same marker shape (color) indicates the same subject.
For CR-GAN, multi-view images of the same subject are embedded
close to each other, which means the identities are better preserved.

produces favorable results with complete embeddings.

4.5 Comparison with BiGAN

To compare our method with BiGAN, we qualitatively show
the image reconstruction results of both methods on CelebA
in Fig. 9. We can ﬁnd that as demonstrated by [Donahue et al.,
2017; Dumoulin et al., 2017], BiGAN cannot reconstruct the
data correctly, while CR-GAN keeps identities well due to the
explicit reconstruction loss we employed.

5 Conclusion

In this paper, we investigate learning “complete representa-
tions” of GAN models. We propose CR-GAN that uses a
two-pathway framework to achieve the goal. Our method can
leverage both labeled and unlabeled data for self-supervised
learning, yielding high-quality multi-view image generations
from even “unseen” data in wild conditions.

Abstract

Generating multi-view images from a single-view
input is an essential yet challenging problem. It has
broad applications in vision, graphics, and robotics.
Our study indicates that the widely-used generative
adversarial network (GAN) may learn “incomplete”
representations due to the single-pathway frame-
work: an encoder-decoder network followed by a
discriminator network. We propose CR-GAN to
address this problem. In addition to the single recon-
struction path, we introduce a generation sideway to
maintain the completeness of the learned embedding
space. The two learning pathways collaborate and
compete in a parameter-sharing manner, yielding
considerably improved generalization ability to “un-
seen” dataset. More importantly, the two-pathway
framework makes it possible to combine both la-
beled and unlabeled data for self-supervised learn-
ing, which further enriches the embedding space
for realistic generations. The experimental results
prove that CR-GAN signiﬁcantly outperforms state-
of-the-art methods, especially when generating from
“unseen” inputs in wild conditions. 1

1 Introduction
Generating multi-view images from a single-view input is an
interesting problem with broad applications in vision, graphics,
and robotics. Yet, it is a challenging problem since 1) comput-
ers need to “imagine” what a given object would look like after
a 3D rotation is applied; and 2) the multi-view generations
should preserve the same “identity”.

Generally speaking, previous solutions to this problem in-
clude model-driven synthesis [Blanz and Vetter, 1999], data-
driven generation [Zhu et al., 2014; Yan et al., 2016], and
a combination of the both [Zhu et al., 2016; Rezende et al.,
2016]. Recently, generative adversarial networks (GANs)
[Goodfellow et al., 2014] have shown impressive results in
multi-view generation [Tran et al., 2017; Zhao et al., 2017].
These GAN-based methods usually have a single-pathway
design: an encoder-decoder network is followed by a discrim-

Figure 1: Top: The limitation of existing GAN-based methods. They
can generate good results if the input is mapped into the learned
subspace (Row 1). However, “unseen” data may be mapped out of
the subspace, leading to poor results (Row 2). Bottom: Our results.
By learning complete representations, the proposed CR-GAN can
generate realistic, identity-preserved images from a single-view input.

inator network. The encoder (E) maps input images into a
latent space (Z), where the embeddings are ﬁrst manipulated
and then fed into the decoder (G) to generate novel views.

However, our experiments indicate that this single-pathway
design may have a severe issue: they can only learn “incom-
plete” representations, yielding limited generalization ability
on “unseen” or unconstrained data. Take Fig. 1 as an example.
During the training, the outputs of E constitute only a sub-
space of Z since we usually have a limited number of training
samples. This would make G only “see” part of Z. During
the testing, it is highly possible that E would map an “unseen”
input outside the subspace. As a result, G may produce poor
results due to the unexpected embedding.

To address this issue, we propose CR-GAN to learn Com-
plete Representations for multi-view generation. The main
idea is, in addition to the reconstruction path, we introduce
another generation path to create view-speciﬁc images from
embeddings that are randomly sampled from Z. Please refer
to Fig. 2 for an illustration. The two paths share the same G.
In other words, G learned in the generation path will guide
the learning of both E and D in the reconstruction path, and
vice versa. E is forced to be an inverse of G, yielding com-
plete representations that would span the entire Z space. More
importantly, the two-pathway learning can easily utilize both
labeled and unlabeled data for self-supervised learning, which

can largely enrich the Z space for natural generations.

To sum up, we have following contributions:

• To the best of our knowledge, we are the ﬁrst to investi-

gate “complete representations” of GAN models;

• We propose CR-GAN that can learn “complete” repre-

sentations, using a two-pathway learning scheme;

• CR-GAN can leverage unlabeled data for self-supervised

learning, yielding improved generation quality;

• CR-GAN can generate high-quality multi-view images

from even “unseen” dataset in wild conditions.

et al., 2017; Dumoulin et al., 2017] try to learn an inverse
mapping to project data back into the latent space. Our method
can also ﬁnd an inverse mapping, make a balanced minimax
game when training data is limited.

Multi-view Synthesis. Hinton et al. [Hinton et al., 2011]
introduced transforming auto-encoder to generate images with
view variance. Yan et al. [Yan et al., 2016] proposed Perspec-
tive Transformer Nets to ﬁnd the projection transformation.
Zhou et al. [Zhou et al., 2016] propose to synthesize views
by appearance ﬂow. Very recently, GAN-based methods usu-
ally follow a single-pathway design: an encoder-decoder net-
work [Peng et al., 2016] followed by a discriminator network.
For example, to normalize the viewpoint, e.g. face frontaliza-
tion, they either combine encoder-decoder with 3DMM [Blanz
and Vetter, 1999] parameters [Yin et al., 2017], or use dupli-
cates to predict global and local details [Huang et al., 2017].
DR-GAN [Tran et al., 2017] follows the single-pathway frame-
work to learn identity features that are invariant to viewpoints.
However, it may learn “incomplete” representations due to the
single-pathway framework. In contrast, CR-GAN can learn
complete representations using a two-pathway network, which
guarantees high-quality generations even for “unseen” inputs.
Pose-Invariant Representation Learning. For represen-
tation learning [Li et al., 2016; Fan et al., 2016], early works
may use Canonical Correlation Analysis to analyze the com-
monality among different pose subspaces [Hardoon et al.,
2004; Peng et al., 2015]. Recently, deep learning based
methods use synthesized images to disentangle pose and
identity factors by cross-reconstruction [Zhu et al., 2014;
Peng et al., 2017], or transfer information from pose variant
inputs to a frontalized appearance [Zhu et al., 2013]. However,
they usually use only labeled data, leading to a limited perfor-
mance. We proposed a two-pathway network to leverage both
labeled and unlabeled data for self-supervised learning, which
can generate realistic images in challenging conditions.

Figure 2: Left: Previous methods use a single path to learn the
latent representation, but it is incomplete in the whole space. Right:
We propose a two-pathway network combined with self-supervised
learning, which can learn complete representations.

3 Proposed Method
3.1 A Toy Example of Incomplete Representations
A single-pathway network, i.e. an encoder-decoder network
followed by a discriminator network, may have the issue of
learning “incomplete” representations. As illustrated in Fig. 2
left, the encoder E and decoder G can “touch” only a subspace
of Z since we usually have a limited number of training data.
This would lead to a severe issue in testing when using “un-
seen” data as the input. It is highly possible that E may map
the novel input out of the subspace, which inevitably leads to
poor generations since G has never “seen” the embedding.

A toy example is used to explain this point. We use Multi-
PIE [Gross et al., 2010] to train a single-pathway network. As
shown in the top of Fig. 1, the network can generate realistic
results on Multi-PIE (the ﬁrst row), as long as the input image
is mapped into the learned subspace. However, when testing
“unseen” images from IJB-A [Klare et al., 2015], the network
may produce unsatisfactory results (the second row). In this
case, the new image is mapped out of the learned subspace.

This fact motivates us to train E and G that can “cover” the
whole Z space, so we can learn complete representations. We
achieve this goal by introducing a separate generation path,
where the generator focuses on mapping the entire Z space to
high-quality images. Fig. 2 illustrates the comparison between
the single-pathway and two-pathway networks. Please refer to
Fig. 3 (d) for an overview of our approach.

3.2 Generation Path
The generation path trains generator G and discriminator D.
Here the encoder E is not involved since G tries to generate
from random noise. Given a view label v and random noise
z, G aims to produce a realistic image G(v, z) under view v.
D is trying to distinguish real data from G’s output, which
minimizes:

E
z∼Pz

[Ds(G(v, z))] − E

[Ds(x)]+

x∼Px
[((cid:107)(cid:53)ˆxD(ˆx)(cid:107)2 − 1)2] − λ2 E
x∼Px

λ1 E

ˆx∼Pˆx

[P (Dv(x) = v)],

(1)

where Px is the data distribution and Pz is the noise uniform
distribution, Pˆx is an interpolation between pairs of points
sampled from data distribution and the generator distribu-
tion [Gulrajani et al., 2017]. G tries to fool D, it maximizes:

E
z∼Pz

[Ds(G(v, z))] + λ3 E
z∼Pz
where (Dv(·), Ds(·)) = D(·) denotes pairwise outputs of
the discriminator. Dv(·) estimates the probability of being a

2. ¯x ← G(vi, z);
3. Update D by Eq. 1, and G by Eq. 2;
4. Sample xj ∼ Px with vj (where xj and xi
share the same identity);
5. (¯v, ¯z) ← E(xi);
6. ˜xj ← G(vj, ¯z);
7. Update D by Eq. 3, and E by Eq. 4;

end

end

speciﬁc view, Ds(·) describes the image quality, i.e., how real
the image is. Note that in Eq. 1, D learns how to estimate the
correct view of a real image [Odena et al., 2017], while G
tries to produce an image with that view in order to get a high
score from D in Eq. 2.

3.3 Reconstruction Path
The reconstruction path trains E and D but keeping G ﬁxed.
E tries to reconstruct training samples, this would guarantee
that E will be learned as an inverse of G, yielding complete
representations in the latent embedding space.

The output of E should be identity-preserved so the multi-
view images will present the same identity. We propose a
cross reconstruction task to make E disentangle the viewpoint
from the identity. More speciﬁcally, we sample a real image
pair (xi, xj) that share the same identity but different views
vi and vj. The goal is to reconstruct xj from xi. To achieve
this, E takes xi as input and outputs an identity-preserved
representation ¯z together with the view estimation ¯v: (¯v, ¯z) =
(Ev(xi), Ez(xi)) = E(xi). Note that ¯v is learned for further
self-supervised training as shown in Sec. 3.4.

G takes ¯z and view vj as the input. As ¯z is expected to carry
the identity information of this person, with view vj’s help, G
should produce ˜xj, the reconstruction of xj. D is trained to
distinguish the fake image ˜xj from the real one xi. Thus D
minimizes:

E
xi,xj ∼Px

[Ds(˜xj) − Ds(xi)]+

λ1 E

ˆx∼Pˆx

[((cid:107)(cid:53)ˆxD(ˆx)(cid:107)2 − 1)2] − λ2 E

[P (Dv(xi) = vi)],

xi∼Px

where ˜xj = G(vj, Ez(xi)). E helps G to generate high
quality image with view vj, so E maximizes:

E
xi,xj ∼Px

[Ds(˜xj) + λ3P (Dv(˜xj) = vj)−

λ4L1(˜xj, xj) − λ5Lv(Ev(xi), vi)],

(3)

(4)

where L1 loss is utilized to enforce that ˜xj is the reconstruction
of xj. Lv is the cross-entropy loss of estimated and ground
truth views, to let E be a good view estimator.

The two-pathway network learns complete representations:
First, in the generation path, G learns how to produce real

end

end

end

images from any inputs in the latent space. Then, in the
reconstruction path, G retains the generative ability since it
keeps unchanged. The alternative training details of the two
pathways are summarized in Algorithm 1.
3.4 Self-supervised Learning
Labeled datasets are usually limited and biased. For example,
Multi-PIE [Gross et al., 2010] is collected in a constrained set-
ting, while large-pose images in 300wLP [Zhu et al., 2016] are
distorted. As a result, G would generate low-quality images
since it has only “seen” poor and limited examples.

To solve this issue, we further improve the proposed CR-
GAN with self-supervised learning. The key idea is to use a
pre-trained model to estimate viewpoints for unlabeled images.
Accordingly, we modify the supervised training algorithm
into two phases. In the ﬁrst stage, we pre-train the network
on labeled data to let E be a good view estimator. In the
second stage, both labeled and unlabeled data are utilized to
boost G. When an unlabeled image x is fed to the network,
a view estimation ¯v is obtained by Ev(·). Denote ˆv to be the
closest one-hot vector of ¯v, in the reconstruction path, we let
E minimize Lv(¯v, ˆv) and then reconstruct x to itself. Similar
to Eq. 3, D minimizes:

E
x∼Px

[Ds(G(ˆv, Ez(x))) − Ds(x)]+

λ1 E

ˆx∼Pˆx

[((cid:107)(cid:53)ˆxD(ˆx)(cid:107)2 − 1)2] − λ2 E
x∼Px

[P (Dv(x) = ˆv)],

similar to Eq. 4, E maximizes:

E
x∼Px

[Ds(G(ˆv, Ez(x))) + λ3P (Dv(G(ˆv, Ez(x))) = ˆv)−

λ4L1(G(ˆv, Ez(x)), x) − λ5Lv(Ev(x), ˆv)].
In the generation path, we let ˆv be the ground truth of x, and
generate an image in view ˆv. So similar to Eq. 1, D minimizes:

E
z∼Pz

[Ds(G(ˆv, z))] − E

[Ds(x)]+

x∼Px
[((cid:107)(cid:53)ˆxD(ˆx)(cid:107)2 − 1)2] − λ2 E

similar to Eq. 2, G maximizes:

E
z∼Pz

[Ds(G(ˆv, z))] + λ3 E
z∼Pz

[P (Dv(G(z)) = ˆv)].

(8)

Once we get the pre-trained model, the encoder E predicts
the probabilities of the input image belonging to different
views. We choose the view with the highest probability as the
estimation. Our strategy is similar to RANSAC algorithm [Fis-
chler and Bolles, 1981], where we treat the estimations with
higher conﬁdence as “inliers” and use them to make view es-
timation more accurate. We summarize the self-supervised
training in Algorithm 2.

Compared with the single-pathway solution, the proposed
two-pathway network boosts the self-supervised learning in
two aspects: 1) it provides a better pre-trained model for
viewpoint estimation as a byproduct; and 2) it guarantees that
we can take full advantage of unlabeled data in training since
CR-GAN learns complete representations.

3.5 Discussion
To highlight the novelty of our method, we compare CR-GAN
with the following three GANs.
In Fig. 3, we show their
network structures as well as ours for visual comparison.

BiGAN [Donahue et al., 2017; Dumoulin et al., 2017]
jointly learns a generation network G and an inference net-
work E. The authors proved that E is an inverse network of
G. However, in practice, BiGAN produces poor reconstruc-
tions due to ﬁnite data and limited network capacity. Instead,
CR-GAN uses explicit reconstruction loss to solve this issue.
DR-GAN [Tran et al., 2017] also tries to learn an identity
preserved representation to synthesize multi-view images. But
we have two distinct differences. First, the output of its en-
coder, also acts as the decoder’s input, completely depends
on the training dataset. Therefore, it can not deal with new
data. Instead, we use the generation path to make sure that
the learning of our G is “complete”. Second, we don’t let
D estimate the identity for training data, because we employ
unlabeled dataset in self-supervised learning which has no
identity information. The involvement of unlabeled dataset
also makes our model more robust for “unseen” data.

TP-GAN [Huang et al., 2017] uses two pathway GANs for
frontal view synthesis. Their framework is different from ours:
First, they use two distinct encoder-decoder networks, while
CR-GAN shares all modules in the two pathways. Besides,

they use two pathways to capture global features and local
details, while we focus on learning complete representations
in multi-view generation.

4 Experiments
CR-GAN aims to learn complete representations in the em-
bedding space. We achieve this goal by combining the two-
pathway architecture with self-supervised learning. We con-
duct experiments to evaluate these two contributions respec-
tively. Then we compare our CR-GAN with DR-GAN [Tran
et al., 2017], both the visual results and t-SNE visualization in
the embedding space are shown. We also compare CR-GAN
and BiGAN with an image reconstruction task.

4.1 Experimental Settings
Datasets. We evaluate CR-GAN on datasets with and without
view labels. Multi-PIE [Gross et al., 2010] is a labeled dataset
collected under constrained environment. We use 250 subjects
from the ﬁrst session with 9 poses within ±60◦, 20 illumi-
nations, and two expressions. The ﬁrst 200 subjects are for
training and the rest 50 for testing. 300wLP [Zhu et al., 2016]
is augmented from 300W [Sagonas et al., 2013] by the face
proﬁling approach [Zhu et al., 2016], which contains view
labels as well. We employ images with yaw angles ranging
from −60◦ to +60◦, and discretize them into 9 intervals.

For evaluation on unlabeled datasets, we use CelebA [Liu
et al., 2015] and IJB-A [Klare et al., 2015]. CelebA contains
a large amount of celebrity images with unbalanced viewpoint
distributions. Thus, we collect a subset of 72,000 images from
it, which uniformly ranging from −60◦ to +60◦. Notice that
the view labels of the images in CelebA are only utilized to col-
lect the subset, while no view or identity labels are employed
in the training process. We also use IJB-A which contains
5,396 images for evaluation. This dataset is challenging, since
there are extensive identity and pose variations.

Implementation Details. Our network implementation is
modiﬁed from the residual networks in WGAN-GP [Gulrajani
et al., 2017], where E shares a similar network structure with
D. During training, we set v to be a one-hot vector with
9 dimensions and z ∈ [−1, 1]119 in the latent space. The
batch size is 64. Adam optimizer [Kingma and Ba, 2015]
is used with the learning rate of 0.0005 and momentum of
[0, 0.9]. According to the setting of WGAN-GP, we let λ1 =

In each case, the images generated by the two-pathway (Row 2) outperform the ones produced by the single-pathway (Row 1).

more epochs in self-supervised learning.

what it has learned from CelebA to IJB-A. Note that it is our
self-supervised learning approach that makes it possible to
train the network on unlabeled datasets.

4.2 Single-pathway vs. Two-pathway
We compare two-pathway network with the one using a single
reconstruction path. All the networks are trained on Multi-PIE.
When test with Muli-PIE, as shown in Fig. 4 (a), both models
produce desirable results. In each view, facial attributes like
glasses are kept well. However, single-pathway model gets un-
satisfactory results on IJB-A, which is an “unseen” dataset. As
shown in Fig. 4 (b), two-pathway model consistently produce
natural images with more details and fewer artifacts. Instead,
the single-pathway model cannot generate images with good
quality. This result prove that our two-pathway network han-
dles “unseen” data well by learning a complete representation
in the embedding space.

4.3 Supervised vs. Self-supervised Learning
The two-pathway network is employed in the following evalu-
ations. We use Multi-PIE and 300wLP in supervised learning.
For self-supervised learning, in addition to the above datasets,
CelebA is employed as well. Note that we don’t use view or
identity labels in CelebA during training.

Evaluation on CelebA. Fig. 5 shows the results on CelebA.
In Fig. 5 (a), although the supervised model generates favor-
able results, there are artifacts in all views. As the supervised
model is only trained on Multi-PIE and 300wLP, it is difﬁ-
cult to “approximate” the data in the wild. Instead, the self-
supervised model has learned a latent representation where
richer features are embedded, so it generates more realistic
results while the identities are well preserved. We can make
the similar observation in Fig. 5 (b). The supervised model
can only generate images that are similar to Multi-PIE, while
the self-supervised model can generate novel identities. In
Fig. 5 (c) and (d), the self-supervised model preserve identity
and attributes in a better way than others.

Evaluation on IJB-A. Fig. 6 shows more results on IJB-A.
We ﬁnd that our self-supervised model successfully generalize

4.4 Comparison with DR-GAN
Furthermore, we compare our self-supervised CR-GAN with
DR-GAN [Tran et al., 2017]. We replace DC-GAN [Rad-
ford et al., 2016] network architecture used in DR-GAN with
WGAN-GP for a fair comparison.

Evaluation on IJB-A. We show the results of DR-GAN
and CR-GAN in Fig. 6 respectively. DR-GAN produces sharp
images, but the facial identities are not well-kept. By contrast,
in Fig. 6 (a) and (b), CR-GAN produces face images with
similar identities. In all cases, DR-GAN fails to produce high-
quality images with large poses. Although not perfect enough,
CR-GAN can synthesize reasonable proﬁle images.

Identity Similarities on IJB-A. We generate 9 views for
each image in IJB-A both using DR-GAN and CR-GAN. Then
we obtain a 128-dim feature for each view by FaceNet [Schroff
et al., 2015]. We evaluate the identity similarities between
the real and generated images by feeding them to FaceNet.
The squared L2 distances of the features directly correspond-
ing to the face similarity: faces of the same subjects have
small distances, while faces of different subjects have large
distances. Table 1 shows the results of the average L2 dis-
tance of CR-GAN and DR-GAN in different datasets. Our
method outperforms DR-GAN on all datasets, especially on
IJB-A which contains unseen data. Fig. 7 shows the t-SNE
visualization in the embedding space of DR-GAN and CR-
GAN respectively. For clarity, we only visualize 10 randomly
selected subjects along with 9 generated views of each. Com-
pared with DR-GAN, CR-GAN produces tighter clusterings:
multi-view images of the same subject are embedded close to
each other. It means the identities are better preserved.

Generative Ability. We utilize DR-GAN and CR-GAN to
generate images from random noises. In Fig. 8, CR-GAN can
produce images with different styles, while DR-GAN leads to
blurry results. This is because the single-pathway generator of
DR-GAN learns incomplete representations in the embedding

supervised model, DR-GAN [Tran et al., 2017] and our self-supervised model. DR-GAN fails to produce favourable images of large poses,
while our method can synthesize reasonable proﬁle images.

(left) and DR-GAN (right), with 10 subjects from IJB-A [Klare et
al., 2015]. The same marker shape (color) indicates the same subject.
For CR-GAN, multi-view images of the same subject are embedded
close to each other, which means the identities are better preserved.

space, which fails to handle random inputs. Instead, CR-GAN
produces favorable results with complete embeddings.

4.5 Comparison with BiGAN

To compare our method with BiGAN, we qualitatively show
the image reconstruction results of both methods on CelebA
in Fig. 9. We can ﬁnd that as demonstrated by [Donahue et al.,
2017; Dumoulin et al., 2017], BiGAN cannot reconstruct the
data correctly, while CR-GAN keeps identities well due to the
explicit reconstruction loss we employed.

5 Conclusion

In this paper, we investigate learning “complete representa-
tions” of GAN models. We propose CR-GAN that uses a
two-pathway framework to achieve the goal. Our method can
leverage both labeled and unlabeled data for self-supervised
learning, yielding high-quality multi-view image generations
from even “unseen” data in wild conditions.
