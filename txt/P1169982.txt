Abstract

This work aims to produce translations that convey source
language content at a formality level that is appropriate
for a particular audience. Framing this problem as a neural
sequence-to-sequence task ideally requires training triplets
consisting of a bilingual sentence pair labeled with target
language formality. However, in practice, available training
examples are limited to English sentence pairs of different
styles, and bilingual parallel sentences of unknown formal-
ity. We introduce a novel training scheme for multi-task mod-
els that automatically generates synthetic training triplets by
inferring the missing element on the ﬂy, thus enabling end-
to-end training. Comprehensive automatic and human assess-
ments show that our best model outperforms existing models
by producing translations that better match desired formality
levels while preserving the source meaning.1

Introduction

Producing language in the appropriate style is a requirement
for natural language generation, as the style of a text conveys
information beyond its literal meaning (Hovy 1987). This
also applies to translation: professional translators adapt
translations to their audience (Nida and Taber 2003), yet
the output style has been overlooked in machine translation.
For example, the French sentence “Bonne id´ee, mais elle ne
convient pas ici.” could be translated to “Good idea, but it
doesn’t ﬁt here.”, which is informal because it elides the sub-
ject, uses contractions and chained clauses. It could also be
translated more formally to “This is a helpful idea. However,
it is not suitable for this purpose.”, which is grammatically
complete and uses more formal and precise terms.

We recently addressed this gap by introducing the task
of Formality-Sensitive Machine Translation (FSMT), where
given a French sentence and a desired formality level, sys-
tems are asked to produce an English translation at the spec-
iﬁed formality level (Niu, Martindale, and Carpuat 2017).
Building FSMT systems is challenging because of the lack
of appropriate training data: bilingual parallel corpora do

not come with formality annotations, and parallel corpora
of a given provenance do not have a uniform style. Previ-
ously, we took a multi-task approach based on sequence-
to-sequence models that were trained to perform French-
English translation and English formality transfer (Rao and
Tetreault 2018) jointly (Niu, Rao, and Carpuat 2018). The
resulting multi-task model performs zero-shot FSMT as it
has never been exposed to training samples annotated with
both reference translation and formality labels.

In this work, we hypothesize that exposing multi-task
models to training samples that directly match the FSMT
task can help generate formal and informal outputs that dif-
fer from each other, and where formality rewrites do not in-
troduce translation errors. We introduce Online Style Infer-
ence, an approach to simulate direct supervision by predict-
ing the target formality of parallel sentence pairs on the ﬂy
at training time, thus enabling end-to-end training. We also
present a variant of side constraints (Sennrich, Haddow, and
Birch 2016a) that improves formality control given inputs of
arbitrary formality level.2

We conduct a comprehensive automatic and human eval-
uation of the resulting FSMT systems. First, we show that
Online Style Inference introduces more differences between
formal and informal translations of the same input, using
automatic metrics to quantify lexical and positional differ-
ences. Second, we conduct a human evaluation which shows
that Online Style Inference preserves the meaning of the in-
put and introduces stronger formality differences compared
to a strong baseline. Finally, we analyze the diversity of
transformations between formal and informal outputs pro-
duced by our approach.

2 A Neural FSMT Model
Neural Machine Translation (NMT) models compute the
conditional probability P (Y |X) of translating a source
sentence, X = (x1, . . . , xn), to a target sentence, Y =
(y1, . . . , ym). By contrast, FSMT requires producing the
most likely translation at the given formality level (cid:96):

ˆY = arg max

P (Y(cid:96) | X, (cid:96); θ).

Ideally,
the FSMT model should be trained on triplets
(X, (cid:96), Y(cid:96))1...N , but in practice, such training data is not
easy to acquire. We tackle this problem by training a cross-
lingual machine translation model (French→English) and a
monolingual bidirectional formality transfer model (Formal-
English↔Informal-English) jointly (Niu, Rao, and Carpuat
2018). Speciﬁcally, the model is trained on the combination
of (X, Y )1...N1 and (Y¯(cid:96), (cid:96), Y(cid:96))1...N2, where Y¯(cid:96) and Y(cid:96) have
opposite formality levels. The joint model is able to perform
zero-shot FSMT by optimizing LM T + LF T , where

LM T =

log P (Y |X; θ),

LF T =

log P (Y(cid:96) | Y¯(cid:96), (cid:96); θ).

Controlling Output Language Formality
FSMT shares the goal of producing output sentences of a
given formality with monolingual formality style transfer
tasks. In both cases, the source sentence usually carries its
own style and the model should be able to override it with
the independent style (cid:96). Previously, we achieved this using
an attentional sequence-to-sequence model with side con-
straints (Sennrich, Haddow, and Birch 2016a), i.e., attach-
ing a style tag (e.g., <2Formal>) to the beginning of each
source example (Niu, Rao, and Carpuat 2018). In this work,
similar to Wang et al. (2018) and Lample et al. (2019), we
attach style tags to both source and target sequences to better
control output formality given inputs of arbitrary style.

Sennrich, Haddow, and Birch (2016a) hypothesize that
source-side tags control the target style because the model
“learns to pay attention to the side constraints”, but it has
not been veriﬁed empirically. We hypothesize that the source
style tag also inﬂuences the encoder hidden states, and pro-
viding a target-side tag lets the decoder beneﬁt from encod-
ing style more directly. This approach yields a single model
which is able to both transfer formality (e.g., from formal
to informal, or vice versa) and preserve formality (e.g., pro-
ducing an informal output given an informal input).

Synthetic Supervision — Online Style Inference
Prior work on multilingual NMT shows that the transla-
tion quality on zero-shot tasks often signiﬁcantly lags be-
hind when supervision is provided (Johnson et al. 2017).
We address this problem by simulating the supervision, i.e.,
generating synthetic training triplets (X, (cid:96), Y ) by using the
FSMT model itself to predict the missing element of the
triplet from parallel sentence pairs (X, Y ).

We introduce Online Style Inference (OSI) to generate
synthetic triplets. Given a translation example (X, Y ), we
view predicting the formality of Y , i.e., (cid:96)Y , as unsupervised
classiﬁcation using only the pre-trained FSMT model.

As illustrated in Figure 1, we use FSMT to produce both
informal and formal translations of the same input, YI =
FSMT(X, (cid:96)I) and YF = FSMT(X, (cid:96)F) respectively.3 We

3YI and YF are generated with the teacher forcing strategy

(Williams and Zipser 1989) given the ground-truth Y .

Figure 1: Online Style Inference. Given a translation ex-
ample (X, Y ), FSMT produces both informal and formal
translations of X, i.e., YI = FSMT(X, (cid:96)I) and YF =
FSMT(X, (cid:96)F). Y is labeled as formal since it is closer to
YF than YI.

hypothesize that the style of the reference translation Y can
be predicted based on its distance from these two transla-
tions. For example, if Y is formal, it should be closer to
YF than YI. We measure the closeness by cross-entropy
difference (Moore and Lewis 2010, CED), i.e., we calcu-
late the difference of their per-token cross-entropy scores,
CED(YI, YF) = HY (YI) − HY (YF). The larger it is, the
closer Y is to YF.

Given a positive threshold τ , we label

(cid:96)Y
=
<2Informal> if CED(YI, YF) < −τ ,
label (cid:96)Y =
<2Formal> if CED(YI, YF) > τ , and label (cid:96)Y =
<2Unknown> otherwise. The threshold τ is chosen dynam-
ically for each mini-batch, and it is equal to the mean of
absolute token-level CED of all tokens within a mini-batch.
Finally, we are able to generate a synthetic training sample,
(X, (cid:96)Y , Y ), on the ﬂy and optimize LF T + LOSI , where

LOSI =

log P (Y | X, (cid:96)Y ; θ).

(X,(cid:96)Y ,Y )

Instead of inferring the style label (cid:96), we could obtain syn-
thetic training triplets by generating target sequences for a
desired (cid:96) and a given input X. We experiment with one such
approach, which we call Online Target Inference (OTI),
and will compare it with OSI empirically for completeness.
However, OTI is expected to be less effective as gener-
ates complete output sequences and is therefore more likely
to introduce noise in synthetic examples. Given the bilin-
gual parallel sentence pair (X, Y ) and a randomly selected
target formality (cid:96) from {<2Informal>, <2Formal>},
we could use the FSMT model to produce a formality-
constrained translation Y 1
(cid:96) = FSMT(X, (cid:96)). We estimate
the quality of Y 1
indirectly using the multi-task nature of
(cid:96)
the FSMT models. The FSMT model can also manipulate
the formality level of the target side Y via monolingual for-
mality transfer to produce Y 2
(cid:96) = Transfer(Y , (cid:96)). We hy-
pothesize that the predictions made by these two different
paths should be consistent.

The quality of Y 2

(cid:96) is presumably more reliable than Y 1
(cid:96) ,
because the embedded transfer model is trained with direct
supervision. We empirically get Y 2
(cid:96) via greedy search on
the ﬂy during the training and use it as the label. Finally, we
optimize LM T + LF T + αLOT I , where

LOT I =

3 Experimental Set-Up
We design experiments to evaluate the impact of our ap-
proaches to (1) formality control, and (2) synthetic super-
vision. We ﬁrst evaluate formality control on an English
style transfer task which provides multiple reference trans-
lations to reliably evaluate formality transfer with automatic
metrics. We then quantify the differences between formal
and informal FSMT translation when using synthetic su-
pervision. Finally, we design a manual evaluation to as-
sess whether synthetic supervision improves over multi-task
FSMT. All these experiments share the following set-up.

Data We use the GYAFC corpus introduced by Rao and
Tetreault (2018) in all tasks. This corpus consists of infor-
mal sentences from Yahoo Answers paired with their for-
mal rewrites by humans. The train split consists of 105K
informal-formal sentence pairs whereas the dev/test sets
consist of roughly 10K/5K pairs for both formality transfer
directions, i.e., I→F and F→I.

We train MT systems on the concatenation of large di-
verse parallel corpora: (1) Europarl.v7 (Koehn 2005), which
is extracted from the proceedings of the European Par-
liament, and tends to be more formal
text; (2) News-
Commentary.v14 (Bojar et al. 2018); (3) OpenSubtitles2016
(Lison and Tiedemann 2016), which consists of movie and
television subtitles, covers a wider spectrum of styles, but
overall tends to be informal since it primarily contains con-
versations. Following our previous work (Niu, Rao, and
Carpuat 2018), we use a bilingual semantic similarity de-
tector to select 16M least divergent examples from ∼27.5M
deduplicated sentence pairs in the original set (Vyas, Niu,
and Carpuat 2018).

Preprocessing We apply normalization,
tokenization,
true-casing, joint source-target BPE with 50,000 operations
(Sennrich, Haddow, and Birch 2016b) and sentence-ﬁltering
(length 50 cutoff) to parallel training data. Table 1 shows
itemized translation data statistics after preprocessing.

Implementation Details We build NMT models upon the
attentional RNN encoder-decoder architecture (Bahdanau,
Cho, and Bengio 2015) implemented in the Sockeye toolkit
(Hieber et al. 2017). Our translation model uses a bi-
directional encoder with a single LSTM layer of size 512,
multilayer perceptron attention with a layer size of 512, and
word representations of size 512. We apply layer normaliza-
tion (Ba, Kiros, and Hinton 2016), add dropout to embed-
dings and RNNs (Gal and Ghahramani 2016) with probabil-
ity 0.2, and tie the source and target embeddings as well as
the output layer’s weight matrix (Press and Wolf 2017). We

train using the Adam optimizer (Kingma and Ba 2015) with
a batch size of 64 sentences and we checkpoint the model
every 1000 updates. The learning rate for baseline models is
initialized to 0.001 and reduced by 30% after 4 checkpoints
without improvement of perplexity on the development set.
Training stops after 10 checkpoints without improvement.

We build our FSMT models by ﬁne-tuning the Multi-
Task model with the dedicated synthetically supervised ob-
jectives described in Section 2, inheriting all settings except
the learning rate which is re-initialized to 0.0001. The hyper-
parameter α in Equation 5 is set to 0.05.

4 Formality Control Evaluation
Our goal is to determine a solid approach for formality con-
trol before adding synthetic supervision. For simplicity, we
conduct this auxiliary evaluation of formality control on four
sub-tasks that use monolingual style transfer data.

Tasks Our task aims to test systems’ ability to produce a
formal or an informal paraphrase for a given English sen-
tence of arbitrary style, as needed in FSMT. It is derived
from formality transfer (Rao and Tetreault 2018), where
models transfer sentences from informal to formal (I→F) or
vice versa (F→I). These sub-tasks only evaluate a model’s
ability in learning mappings between informal and formal
languages. We additionally evaluate the ability of systems
to preserve formality on informal to informal (I→I) and
formal to formal (F→F) sub-tasks. GYAFC provides four
reference target-style human rewrites for each source-style
sentences in the test set. For formality preservation, the out-
put is compared with the input sentence in the test set.

Models All models are trained on bidirectional data,
which is constructed by swapping the informal and formal
sentences of the parallel GYAFC corpus and appending the
swapped version to the original. The formality of each target
sentence represents the desired input style.

We compare our approach, TAG-SRC-TGT, which at-
taches tags to both input and output sides, against two base-
lines. We ﬁrst implement a baseline method which is trained
only on the bidirectional data without showing the target for-
mality (denoted as None). The second baseline is TAG-SRC,
the standard method that attaches tags to the source. In ad-
dition, we conduct an ablation study on the side constraint
method using TAG-SRC-BLOCK, which attaches a tag to the
source just like TAG-SRC but blocks the visibility of the tag
embeddings from the encoder and retains their connections
to the decoder via the attention mechanism (Table 2).

Results Our approach, TAG-SRC-TGT, achieves the best
performance overall, reaching the best BLEU scores for
three of the four sub-tasks. Comparing with methods ac-
knowledging the target formality (i.e., TAG-SRC*),
the
None baseline gets slightly lower BLEU scores when it
learns to ﬂip the formality on I→F and F→I tasks.4 How-
ever, it performs much worse (10-20 BLEU points lower) on

4As Rao and Tetreault (2018) note, F→I models yield lower
BLEU than I→F models because informal reference rewrites are

Table 2: BLEU scores for variants of side constraint in controlling style on all formality transfer and preservation directions.
We report mean and standard deviation over ﬁve randomly seeded models. ∆BLEU between each model and the widely
used TAG-SRC methods show that (1) blocking the visibility of source tags from the encoder (TAG-SRC-BLOCK) limits its
formality control ability; (2) using style tags on both source and target sides (TAG-SRC-TGT) helps control formality better
when considering the full range of formality change and formality preservation tasks.

I→I and F→F tasks conﬁrming that the None baseline is
only able to ﬂip formality and not to preserve it. The TAG-
SRC approach is able to preserve formality better than the
None baseline, but not as well as TAG-SRC-TGT.

TAG-SRC-BLOCK lags behind TAG-SRC, especially for
formality preservation tasks (1-2 BLEU points lower). This
discrepancy indicates that the attention mechanism only
contributes a portion of the control ability. On the other
hand, our proposed variant TAG-SRC-TGT performs better
than TAG-SRC on 3/4 tasks (i.e., I→F, I→I, and F→F).

Taken together, these observations show that the impact of
tags is not limited to the attention model, and their embed-
dings inﬂuence the hidden representations of encoders and
decoders positively. The auxiliary evaluation thus conﬁrms
that adding style tags to both source and target sequences is a
good approach to model monolingual formality transfer, and
therefore motivates using it in our FSMT models as well.

5 Quantifying Differences Between Formal

and Informal Outputs in FSMT

Having established the effectiveness of our formality control
mechanism, we now turn to the FSMT task and test whether
synthetic supervision succeeds in introducing more differ-
ences between formal and informal outputs, regardless of
translation quality. We will consider translation quality in
the next section.

Tasks We test FSMT approaches on two French-English
translation test sets with diverse formality: WMT new-
stest20145 and MSLT conversation test set6. While each test
set contains text of varying formality, the written language
used in news stories is typically more formal than the spoken
language used in conversations.

Baseline Models We start with a standard NMT model
which is trained with non-tagged French-English parallel
data. This model achieves 28.63 BLEU on WMT and 47.83
BLEU on MSLT. We provide these BLEU scores for a sanity
check on translation quality.7 FSMT models could receive

highly divergent.

up to two lower BLEU points on WMT and up to four lower
BLEU points on MSLT. However, BLEU cannot be used
to evaluate FSMT: given a single reference translation of
unknown formality, BLEU penalizes both unwanted trans-
lation errors and correct formality rewrites. For example,
given the reference “we put together the new wardrobe”, the
good formal output “we assembled the new wardrobe” and
the incorrect output “we accumulated the new wardrobe”
would get the same BLEU score.

Next, we compare with Multi-Task, which performs
zero-shot FSMT by training machine translation (MT) and
formality transfer (FT) jointly. We also compare other two
FSMT models introduced in our previous work (Niu, Rao,
and Carpuat 2018) for completeness. (1) NMT DS-Tag. It
performs data selection on MT training examples (X, Y )
using CED in a standard way: it pre-trains language models
for informal and formal English in the FT training data and
calculates CED(Y ) = Hinf ormal(Y ) − Hf ormal(Y ). We
aim at using all parallel data, for fair comparison, we also
conduct three-way tagging as introduced in Section 2. An
NMT model is then trained with the formality-tagged train-
ing pairs. (2) Multi-Task DS-Tag. It is the combination of
Multi-Task and NMT DS-Tag and is trained on both tagged
MT pairs and FT pairs. This method is similar to Online
Style Inference in terms of tagging training examples us-
ing CED. However, Multi-Task DS-Tag uses standard ofﬂine
language models while Online Style Inference can be inter-
preted as using source-conditioned online language models.

Metrics Since FSMT quality cannot be evaluated auto-
matically, we devise an approach to quantify surface differ-
ences between formal and informal outputs of a given sys-
tem to guide system development. We deﬁne the Lexical and
Positional Differences (LEPOD) score for this purpose, and
will come back to FSMT evaluation using human judgments
in the next section.

We ﬁrst compute the pairwise Lexical Difference (LED)
based on the percentages of tokens that are not found in both
outputs. Formally,

LED =

(cid:18) |S1\S2|
|S1|
where S1 and S2 is a pair of sequences and S1\S2 indicates
tokens appearing in S1 but not in S2.

sequence of phrasal units that are consistent with the word
alignments. Word alignments are obtained using the latest
METEOR software (Denkowski and Lavie 2014), which
supports stem, synonym and paraphrase matches in addi-
tion to exact matches. (2) We compute the maximum distor-
tion within each segment. To do these, we ﬁrst re-index N
aligned words and calculate distortions as the position dif-
ferences (i.e., index2 - index1 in Figure 2). Then, we keep a
running total of the distortion array (d1, d2, . . . ), and do seg-
mentation p = (di, . . . , dj) ∈ P whenever the accumulation
is zero (i.e., (cid:80) p = 0). Now we can deﬁne

In extreme cases, when the ﬁrst word in S1 is reordered
to the last position in S2, POD score approaches 1. When
words are aligned without any reordering, each alignment
constitutes a segment and POD equals 0.

Findings Multi-task methods introduce more differences
between formal and informal translations than NMT base-
lines, and synthetic supervision with Online Target Inference
obtains the best lexical and positional difference scores over-
all (Table 3). Speciﬁcally, Multi-Task and Multi-Task DS-
Tag get similar lexical and positional variability, and both
surpass NMT DS-Tag. Online Target Inference has much
larger positional discrepancy scores than all other methods,
which indicates that it produces more structural diverse sen-
tences. However, larger surface changes are more likely to

alter meaning, and the changes are not guaranteed to be
formality-oriented. We therefore turn to human judgments
to assess whether meaning is preserved, and whether surface
differences are indeed formality related.

6 Human Evaluation of FSMT
Evaluating FSMT systems requires evaluating whether their
outputs correctly convey the meaning of the source, and
whether the differences between their formal and infor-
mal outputs are indicative of formality. Neither LePoD nor
BLEU can assess these criteria automatically. We there-
fore conduct human evaluation to investigate whether syn-
thetic supervision improves over our reimplementation of
the state-of-the-art approach (Multi-Task).

Methodology Following Rao and Tetreault (2018) and our
previous work (Niu, Rao, and Carpuat 2018), we adopt the
following evaluation criteria: meaning preservation and for-
mality difference.8 Our evaluation scheme asks annotators
to directly compare sentence pairs on these two criteria and
obtains win:tie:loss ratios.

Meaning Preservation We ask annotators to compare out-
puts of two systems against the reference translation, and
decide which one better preserves the reference meaning.

Formality Difference We ask annotators to compare out-
puts of two systems and decide which is more formal.
We randomly sample ∼150 examples from WMT and
MSLT respectively, and obtain judgments for informal and
formal translations of each example. We collect these judg-
ments from 30 volunteers who are native or near-native En-
glish speakers. Annotators only compare translations of the
same (intended) formality generated by different systems.
Identical translation pairs are excluded. Each comparison
receives ﬁve independent judgments, unless the ﬁrst three
judgments are identical.

The inter-rater agreement using Krippendorff’s alpha is
∼0.5.9 It indicates that there is some variation in annotators’
assessment of language formality. We therefore aggregate
independent judgments using MACE (Hovy et al. 2013),
which estimates the competence of annotators.

Findings Overall, the human evaluation shows that syn-
thetic supervision successfully improves desired formality
of the output while preserving translation quality, com-
pared to the multi-task baseline, which represents prior
state-of-the-art (Niu, Rao, and Carpuat 2018). Figure 3a
and 3b show that Online Style Inference generates in-
formal translations that are annotated as more informal

8We do not evaluate ﬂuency because both Rao and Tetreault
(2018) and Niu, Rao, and Carpuat (2018) show various automatic
systems achieve an almost identical ﬂuency level. Annotators also
have systematically biased feeling in ﬂuency when comparing for-
mal and informal sentences (Niu, Martindale, and Carpuat 2017;
Rao and Tetreault 2018).

9In a sentential formality scoring task, Pavlick and Tetreault
(2016) also report relatively low inter-annotator agreement with
other measurements.

(c) Meaning Preservation

Figure 3: Win/Tie/Loss counts when comparing Online Style Inference to Multi-Task. Informal translations generated by OSI
are annotated as more informal than Multi-Task, while formal translations are annotated as more formal. The OSI model also
gets more instances that better preserve the meaning.

Table 4: Heuristic analysis of the differences between informal and formal translations. Synthetic supervision introduce more
changes. Online Target Inference usually performs simple substitutions while Online Style Inference performs more less-
deterministic changes. Online Style Inference generates more complete and longer formal translations.

(win:tie:loss=151:80:52), while formal translations are an-
notated as more formal (win:tie:loss=153:84:61). For both
cases, the win-loss differences are signiﬁcant with p <
0.001 using the sign test, where ties are evenly distributed
to wins and losses as suggested by Demsar (2006). The re-
sults conﬁrm that synthetic supervision lets the model bet-
ter tailor its outputs to the desired formality, and suggest
that the differences between formal and informal outputs
detected by the LEPOD scores are indeed representative of
formality changes. Figure 3c shows that Online Style Infer-
ence preserves the meaning of the source better than Multi-
Task (win:tie:loss=205:217:155). The win-loss difference
for meaning preservation is still signiﬁcant with p < 0.02,
but is less strong than formality difference.

7 Analysis
How do informal and formal translations differ from each
other? Manual inspection reveals that most types of changes
made by human rewriters (Pavlick and Tetreault 2016;
Rao and Tetreault 2018), including use of ﬁller words, com-
pleteness of output and various types of paraphrasing, are
observed in our system outputs (see examples in Table 5).
We quantify such changes further semi-automatically.

We ﬁrst check how often formal and informal translations
are identical. This happens less frequently with synthetic su-
pervision (Table 4) than with the baseline multi-task system:
Online Style Inference system introduces changes between
formal and informal translations 12% more often in 6,546
test examples compared to the baseline.

Then, we use rules to check how often simple formality
change patterns are found in FSMT outputs (Table 4). A sen-
tence can be made more formal by expanding contractions
(contr.) and removing unnecessary ﬁllers such as conjunc-
tions (so/and/but) and interjections (well) at the beginning

of a sentence (ﬁller). Online Target Inference performs these
changes more frequently. We also examine the introduction
of quotation marks in formal translations (quot.); using pos-
sessive of instead of possessive ’s (poss.); and rewrites of
informal use of declarative form for yes-no questions (y/n).
Online Style Inference output matches these patterns better
than other systems.

Next, we conduct a manual analysis to understand the na-
ture of remaining differences between formal and informal
translations of Online Style Inference. We observe that el-
lipsis is frequent in informal outputs, while formal sentences
are more complete, using complement subjects, proper arti-
cles, conjunctions, relative pronouns, etc. This is reﬂected
in their longer length (∆length in Table 4 is the average
length difference in characters). Lexical or phrasal para-
phrases are frequently used to convey formality, substituting
familiar terms with more formal variants (e.g., “grandma”
vs. “grandmother”). Examining translations with large POD
scores shows that Online Style Inference is more likely to
reorder adverbs based on formality: e.g., “I told you al-
ready” (I) vs. “I already told you” (F).

A few types of human rewrites categorized by Pavlick and
Tetreault (2016) and Rao and Tetreault (2018) are not ob-
served here. For example, our models almost always pro-
duce words with correct casing and standard spelling for
both informal and formal languages. This matches the char-
acteristics of the translation data we used for training.

Finally, we manually inspect system outputs that fail to
preserve the source meaning and reveal some limitations of
using synthetic supervision. (1) Inaccurate synthetic labels
introduce noise. Online Target Inference sometimes gener-
ates “I am not sure” as the formal translation, regardless
of the source. We hypothesize that this is due to the imper-
fect synthetic translations generated by the formality trans-

fer sub-model reinforce this error pattern. (2) Synthetic data
may not reﬂect the true distribution. Occasionally, Online
Style Inference drops the ﬁrst word in a formal sentence
even if it is not a ﬁller, e.g. “On Thursday, ...” We hypoth-
esize that labeling too many formal/informal examples of
similar patterns could lead to ignoring context. While On-
line Style Inference improves meaning preservation compar-
atively, it still bears the challenge of altering meaning when
ﬁtting to a certain formality, such as generating “there will
be no longer than the hill of Runyonyi” when the reference
is “then only Rumyoni hill will be left”.

8 Related Work
Controlling the output style in MT has received sparse atten-
tion. The pioneering work by Mima, Furuse, and Iida (1997)
improves rule-based MT using extra-linguistic information
such as speaker’s role and gender. With the success of sta-
tistical MT models, people usually deﬁne styles by select-
ing representative data. After pre-selecting relevant data of-
ﬂine, Lewis, Federmann, and Xin (2015) and van der Wees,
Bisazza, and Monz (2016) build conversational MT systems,
Rabinovich et al. (2017) and Michel and Neubig (2018)
build personalized (gender-speciﬁc) MT systems, Sennrich,
Haddow, and Birch (2016a) control the output preference
of T-V pronouns, while Yamagishi et al. (2016) control the
active/passive voice of the translation. In contrast, we dy-
namically generate synthetic supervision and our methods
outperform ofﬂine data selection.

Multi-task FSMT is closely related to zero-shot multi-
lingual NMT. Johnson et al. (2017) ﬁrst built a multilin-
gual NMT system using shared NMT encoder-decoders for
all languages with target language speciﬁers. The resulting
system can translate between language pairs that are never
trained on, but performs worse than supervised models and

even the simple pivoting approach for those language pairs.
Strategies to mitigate this problem include target word ﬁl-
tering (Ha, Niehues, and Waibel 2017), dedicated attention
modules (Blackwood, Ballesteros, and Ward 2018), gener-
ating dedicated encoder-decoder parameters (Platanios et al.
2018) and encouraging the model to use source-language
invariant representations (Arivazhagan et al. 2019). We ad-
dress this problem from a different perspective for the FSMT
task by automatically inferring style labels. Our Online Tar-
get Inference approach is similar in spirit to a contemporane-
ous method that encourages the model to produce equivalent
translations of parallel sentences into an auxiliary language
(Al-Shedivat and Parikh 2019).

9 Conclusion
This paper showed that synthetic supervision improves
multi-task models for formality-sensitive machine transla-
tion. We introduced a novel training scheme for multi-task
models that, given bilingual parallel examples and mono-
lingual formality transfer examples, automatically generate
synthetic training triples by inferring the target formality
from a given translation pair. Human evaluation shows that
this approach outperforms a strong multi-task baseline by
producing translations that better match desired formality
levels while preserving the source meaning. Additional au-
tomatic evaluation shows that (1) attaching style tags to both
input and output sequences improves the ability of a single
model to control formality, by not only transferring but also
preserving formality when required; and (2) synthetic super-
vision via Online Target Inference introduces more changes
between formal and informal translations of the same input.
Analysis shows that these changes span almost all types of
changes made by human rewriters.

Taken together, these results show the promise of syn-

thetic supervision for style-controlled language generation
applications. In future work, we will investigate scenarios
where style transfer examples are not readily available, in-
cluding for languages other than English, and for style dis-
tinctions that are more implicit and not limited to binary
formal-informal distinctions.

A Details of the Human Evaluation
As described in the main paper, we assess model outputs on two
criteria: meaning preservation and formality difference.
Meaning Preservation The following instruction is provided to

annotators.

For each task, you will be presented with an English
sentence and two rewrites of that sentence. Your task is
to judge which rewrite better preserves the meaning of
the original and choose from:
• Rewrite 1 is much better
• Rewrite 1 is better
• No preference between Rewrite 1 and Rewrite 2 (no

difference in meaning or hard to say)

• Rewrite 2 is better
• Rewrite 2 is much better

Note that this task focuses on differences in content,
so differences in style (such as formality) between the
original and rewrites are considered okay. [Some exam-
ples with explanations are provided.]

Formality Difference The following instruction is provided to an-

notators.

People use different varieties of language depending
on the situation: formal language is required in news ar-
ticles, ofﬁcial speeches or academic assignments, while
informal language is more appropriate in instant mes-
sages or spoken conversations between friends.

You will be presented with two English sentences,
and your task is to decide which one is more formal and
choose from:
• Sentence 1 is much more formal
• Sentence 1 is more formal
• No preference between Sentence 1 and Sentence 2

(no difference in formality or hard to say)

• Sentence 2 is more formal
• Sentence 2 is much more formal

Keep in mind:

• Language formality can be affected by many factors,
such as the choices of grammar, vocabulary, and
punctuation.

• The sentences in the pair could have different mean-
ings. Please rate the formality of the sentences inde-
pendent of their meaning.

• The sentences in the pair could be nonsensical.
Please rate the formality of the sentences indepen-
dent of their quality.
Generally, a sentence with small formality changes
such as fewer contractions, proper punctuation or some
formal terms is considered “more formal”. A sentence
is considered “much more formal” if it contains multiple
indicators of formality, or if the sentence construction
itself reﬂects a more formal style. That said, feel free to
use your own judgment for doing the task if what you
see is not covered by these examples. [Some examples
with explanations are provided.]

B Extended Formality Control Evaluation
While the implementations of neural language generation converge
to an encoder-decoder framework, the design choice of controlling
the style is full of variety. The style information could be injected
into different parts of the heterogeneous neural network and all
roads lead to Rome. However, those implementations have never
been compared with a controlled experiment and analyzed con-
trastively. We therefore conduct a benchmark test on a four-way
formality rewriting task introduced in the main paper.

In order to focus on the designing of style-sensitive neural mod-
els, we compare methods performing formality rewriting with a
single encoder and a single decoder, in contrast with a dedicated
model or decoder for each transfer direction (Rao and Tetreault
2018; Fu et al. 2018). The attention mechanism is the de facto stan-
dard for language generation (Bahdanau, Cho, and Bengio 2015;
Luong, Pham, and Manning 2015; Xu et al. 2015), we therefore
compare methods being compatible with the attention mechanism,
in contract with methods that compress the content into one sin-
gle vector (Mueller, Gifford, and Jaakkola 2017; Hu et al. 2017;
Shen et al. 2017; Fu et al. 2018).

numbers before and after ‘±’ are the mean and standard deviation over ﬁve randomly seeded models. Methods are compared
with TAG-SRC-TGT and the ∆BLEU scores are listed.

We compare the following methods, with a focus on their com-

plexity and effectiveness.

rate the style information only to the decoder, on the other hand,
get lower BLEU scores across the board.

TAG-SRC-TGT This is the method used in the main paper. It at-
taches style tags to both source and target sequences. Each ad-
ditional tag occupies one embedding vector, which has a size of
O(Ew), where Ew is the word embedding size.

FACTOR The style information can be incorporated as source
word factors, which is implemented as style factor embeddings
concatenated to the word embeddings (Sennrich and Haddow
2016), i.e., ˜Xi = [Xi; X style
]. Korotkova, Del, and Fishel
(2018) adopt this design choice for multiple-style transfer due
to its ﬂexibility. Summing the factor and word embeddings of
the same size is another combination strategy and we name
it FACTOR-SUM, which uses O(Ew) space, as opposite to
FACTOR-CONCAT, which uses O(Es) space. Es is the style em-
bedding size and usually much smaller than Ew.10

i

t

PRED Alternatively, we can inject the style information later on to
the decoder by concatenating style embeddings to predicted tar-
get word embeddings, i.e., ˜Yt = [Yt; Y style
]. Ficler and Gold-
berg (2017) use this method in the style-conditioned language
generation. Summing can also be used here, and we name these
two variants PRED-CONCAT and PRED-SUM. The space com-
plexities are O(Es) and O(Ew).
Note that for both FACTOR and PRED, the computational com-
plexity also increase proportionally with the sequence length
since the style embeddings are combined with word embeddings
for each time step.

BOS Analogical to TAG, the target style embeddings can be dy-
namically attached to the target sequence as a begin-of-sequence
symbol (<BOS>). This approach has been successfully applied
to multiple-attribute text rewriting (Lample et al. 2019). Each
stylistic <BOS> embedding occupies O(Ew) space.

BIAS The bias parameter inﬂuences the model’s lexical choice in
the output layer (i.e. softmax(W ht + b)), so we can assign a
dedicated bias for each style. Michel and Neubig (2018) use this
technique in personalized NMT. Each dedicated bias has a size
of O(V ), where V is the vocabulary size.

We compare all methods to TAG-SRC-TGT, which is introduced
in the main paper. Experimental settings and implementation de-
tails are identical to the intrinsic evaluation in the main paper and
we report scores in Table 6.

The other method family incorporating the style information as
early as at the encoding stage, FACTOR, waxes and wanes, and per-
forms similar to TAG-SRC-TGT. Remaining methods that incorpo-

10We use Es = 5 in our experiments.
