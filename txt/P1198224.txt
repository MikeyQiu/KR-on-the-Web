Abstract

Cross-lingual word embeddings are becoming
increasingly important in multilingual NLP.
Recently, it has been shown that these em-
beddings can be effectively learned by align-
ing two disjoint monolingual vector spaces
through linear transformations , using no more
than a small bilingual dictionary as supervi-
sion. In this work, we propose to apply an ad-
ditional transformation after the initial align-
ment step, which moves cross-lingual syn-
onyms towards a middle point between them.
By applying this transformation our aim is
to obtain a better cross-lingual integration of
the vector spaces.
In addition, and perhaps
surprisingly, the monolingual spaces also im-
prove by this transformation. This is in con-
trast to the original alignment, which is typ-
ically learned such that the structure of the
monolingual spaces is preserved. Our exper-
iments conﬁrm that the resulting cross-lingual
embeddings outperform state-of-the-art mod-
els in both monolingual and cross-lingual eval-
uation tasks.

Introduction

Word embeddings are one of the most widely used
resources in NLP, as they have proven to be of
enormous importance for modeling linguistic phe-
nomena in both supervised and unsupervised set-
tings.
In particular, the representation of words
in cross-lingual vector spaces (henceforth, cross-
lingual word embeddings) is quickly gaining in
popularity. One of the main reasons is that they
play a crucial role in transferring knowledge from
one language to another, speciﬁcally in down-
stream tasks such as information retrieval (Vuli´c
and Moens, 2015b), entity linking (Tsai and Roth,
2016) and text classiﬁcation (Mogadala and Ret-
tinger, 2016), while at the same time providing im-
provements in multilingual NLP problems such as
machine translation (Zou et al., 2013).

There exist different approaches for obtaining
these cross-lingual embeddings. One of the most
successful methodological directions, which con-
stitutes the main focus of this paper, attempts to
learn bilingual embeddings via a two-step process:
ﬁrst, word embeddings are trained on monolin-
gual corpora and then the resulting monolingual
spaces are aligned by taking advantage of bilin-
gual dictionaries (Mikolov et al., 2013b; Faruqui
and Dyer, 2014; Xing et al., 2015).

These alignments are generally modeled as lin-
ear transformations, which are constrained such
that the structure of the initial monolingual spaces
is left unchanged. This can be achieved by im-
posing an orthogonality constraint on the linear
transformation (Xing et al., 2015; Artetxe et al.,
2016). Our hypothesis in this paper is that such
approaches can be further improved, as they rely
on the assumption that the internal structure of the
two monolingual spaces is identical.
In reality,
however, this structure is inﬂuenced by language-
speciﬁc phenomena, e.g., the fact that Spanish dis-
tinguishes between masculine and feminine nouns
(Davis, 2015) as well as the speciﬁc biases of
the different corpora from which the monolingual
spaces were learned. Because of this, monolingual
embedding spaces are not isomorphic (Søgaard
et al., 2018; Kementchedjhieva et al., 2018). On
the other hand, simply dropping the orthogonality
constraints leads to overﬁtting, and is thus not ef-
fective in practice.

The solution we propose is to start with existing
state-of-the-art alignment models (Artetxe et al.,
2017; Conneau et al., 2018), and to apply a fur-
ther transformation to the resulting initial align-
ment. For each word w with translation w(cid:48), this
additional transformation aims to map the vector
representations of both w and w(cid:48) onto their aver-
age, thereby creating a cross-lingual vector space
which intuitively corresponds to the average of the

two aligned monolingual vector spaces. Similar to
the initial alignment, this mapping is learned from
a small bilingual lexicon.

Our experimental results show that the proposed
additional transformation does not only beneﬁt
cross-lingual evaluation tasks, but, perhaps sur-
prisingly, also monolingual ones. In particular, we
perform an extensive set of experiments on stan-
dard benchmarks for bilingual dictionary induc-
tion and monolingual and cross-lingual word simi-
larity, as well as on an extrinsic task: cross-lingual
hypernym discovery.

Code and pre-trained embeddings to reproduce
our experiments and to apply our model to any
given cross-lingual embeddings are available at

2 Related Work

Bilingual word embeddings have been extensively
studied in the literature in recent years. Their na-
ture varies with respect to the supervision signals
used for training (Upadhyay et al., 2016; Ruder
et al., 2018). Some common signals to learn
bilingual embeddings come from parallel (Her-
mann and Blunsom, 2014; Luong et al., 2015;
Levy et al., 2017) or comparable corpora (Vuli´c
and Moens, 2015a; Søgaard et al., 2015; Vuli´c
and Moens, 2016), or lexical resources such as
WordNet, ConceptNet or BabelNet (Speer et al.,
2017; Mrksic et al., 2017; Goikoetxea et al., 2018).
However,
these sources of supervision may be
scarce, limited to certain domains or may not be
directly available for certain language pairs.

Another branch of research exploits pre-trained
monolingual embeddings with weak signals such
as bilingual lexicons for learning bilingual embed-
dings (Mikolov et al., 2013b; Faruqui and Dyer,
2014; Ammar et al., 2016; Artetxe et al., 2016).
Mikolov et al. (2013b) was one of the ﬁrst attempts
into this line of research, applying a linear trans-
formation in order to map the embeddings from
one monolingual space into another. They also
noted that more sophisticated approaches, such
as using multilayer perceptrons, do not improve
with respect to their linear counterparts. Xing
et al. (2015) built upon this work by normaliz-
ing word embeddings during training and adding
an orthogonality constraint. In a complementary
direction, Faruqui and Dyer (2014) put forward
a technique based on canonical correlation anal-
ysis to obtain linear mappings for both monolin-

gual embedding spaces into a new shared space.
Artetxe et al. (2016) proposed a similar linear
mapping to Mikolov et al. (2013b), generalizing
it and providing theoretical justiﬁcations which
also served to reinterpret the methods of Faruqui
and Dyer (2014) and Xing et al. (2015). Smith
et al. (2017) further showed how orthogonality
was required to improve the consistency of bilin-
gual mappings, making them more robust to noise.
Finally, a more complete generalization providing
further insights on the linear transformations used
in all these models can be found in Artetxe et al.
(2018a).

These approaches generally require large bilin-
gual lexicons to effectively learn multilingual em-
beddings (Artetxe et al., 2017). Recently, how-
ever, alternatives which only need very small dic-
tionaries, or even none at all, have been proposed
to learn high-quality embeddings via linear map-
pings (Artetxe et al., 2017; Conneau et al., 2018).
More details on the speciﬁcs of these two ap-
proaches can be found in Section 3.1. These mod-
els have in turn paved the way for the development
of machine translation systems which do not re-
quire any parallel corpora (Artetxe et al., 2018b;
Lample et al., 2018). Moreover, the fact that such
approaches only need monolingual embeddings,
instead of parallel or comparable corpora, makes
them easily adaptable to different domains (e.g.,
social media or web corpora).

In this paper we build upon these state-of-the-
art approaches by applying an additional trans-
formation, which aims to map each word and its
translation onto the average of their vector repre-
sentations. This strategy bears some resemblance
with the idea of learning meta-embeddings (Yin
and Sch¨utze, 2016). Meta-embeddings are vector
space representations which aggregate several pre-
trained word embeddings from a given language
(e.g., trained using different corpora and/or dif-
ferent word embedding models). Empirically it
was found that such meta-embeddings can often
outperform the individual word embeddings from
which they were obtained. In particular, it was re-
cently argued that word vector averaging can be a
highly effective approach for learning such meta-
embeddings (Coates and Bollegala, 2018). The
main difference between such approaches and our
work is that because we rely on a small dictionary,
we cannot simply average word vectors, since for
most words we do not know the corresponding

translation. Instead, we train a regression model
to predict this average word vector from the vector
representation of the given word only, i.e., without
using the vector representation of its translation.

3 Methodology

Our approach for improving cross-lingual embed-
dings consists of three main steps, where the ﬁrst
two steps are the same as in existing methods.
In particular, given two monolingual corpora, a
word vector space is ﬁrst learned independently
for each language. This can be achieved with
common word embedding models, e.g., Word2vec
(Mikolov et al., 2013a), GloVe (Pennington et al.,
2014) or FastText (Bojanowski et al., 2017). Sec-
ond, a linear alignment strategy is used to map the
monolingual embeddings to a common bilingual
vector space (Section 3.1). Third, a ﬁnal trans-
formation is applied on the aligned embeddings
so the word vectors from both languages are re-
ﬁned and further integrated with each other (Sec-
tion 3.2). This third step is the main contribution
of our paper.

3.1 Aligning monolingual spaces

Once the monolingual word embeddings have
been obtained, a linear transformation is applied in
order to integrate them into the same vector space.
This linear transformation is generally carried out
using a supervision signal, typically in the form of
a bilingual dictionary. In the following we explain
two state-of-the-art models performing this linear
transformation.

VecMap (Artetxe et al., 2017). VecMap uses
an orthogonal
transformation over normalized
word embeddings. An iterative two-step proce-
dure is also implemented in order to avoid the need
of starting with a large seed dictionary (e.g., in the
original paper it was tested with a very small bilin-
gual dictionary of just 25 pairs).
In this proce-
dure, ﬁrst, the linear mapping is estimated using
a small bilingual dictionary, and then, this dictio-
nary is augmented by applying the learned trans-
formation to new words from the source language.
Lastly, the process is repeated until some conver-
gence criterion is met.

MUSE (Conneau et al., 2018).
In this case, the
transformation matrix is learned through an iter-

ative Procrustes alignment (Sch¨onemann, 1966).1
The anchor points needed for this alignment can
be obtained either through a supplied bilingual
dictionary or through an unsupervised model. This
unsupervised model is trained using adversarial
learning to obtain an initial alignment of the two
monolingual spaces, which is then reﬁned by
the Procrustes alignment using the most frequent
words as anchor points. A new distance met-
ric for the embedding space, referred to as cross-
domain similarity local scaling, is also introduced.
This metric, which takes into account the near-
est neighbors of both source and target words,
was shown to better handle high-density regions
of the space, thus alleviating the hubness problem
of word embedding models (Radovanovi´c et al.,
2010; Dinu et al., 2015), which arises when a few
points (known as hubs) become the nearest neigh-
bors of many other points in the embedding space.

3.2 Meeting in the middle

After the initial alignment of the monolingual
word embeddings, our proposed method leverages
an additional linear model to reﬁne the result-
ing bilingual word embeddings. This is because
the methods presented in the previous section ap-
ply constraints to ensure that the structure of the
monolingual embeddings is largely preserved. As
already mentioned in the introduction, conceptu-
ally this may not be optimal, as embeddings for
different languages and trained from different cor-
pora can be expected to be structured somewhat
differently. Empirically, as we will see in the eval-
uation, after applying methods such as VecMap
and MUSE there still tend to be signiﬁcant gaps
between the vector representations of words and
their translations. Our method directly attempts
to reduce these gaps by moving each word vec-
tor towards the middle point between its current
representation and the representation of its trans-
lation. In this way, by bringing the two monolin-
gual fragments of the space closer to each other,
we can expect to see an improved performance
on cross-lingual evaluation tasks such as bilin-
gual dictionary induction. Importantly, the inter-
nal structure of the two monolingual fragments
themselves is also affected by this step. By aver-

1Very recently, Kementchedjhieva et al. (2018) showed
that projecting both monolingual embedding spaces onto a
third space (instead of directly onto each other) using a gen-
eralized Procrustes analysis facilitates the learning of align-
ments.

aging between the representations obtained from
different languages, we hypothesize that the im-
pact of language-speciﬁc phenomena and corpus
speciﬁc biases will be reduced, thereby ending up
with more “neutral” monolingual embeddings.

In the following, we detail our methodologi-
cal approach. First, we leverage the same bilin-
gual dictionary that was used to obtain the ini-
tial alignment (Section 3.1). Speciﬁcally, let D =
{(w, w(cid:48))} be the given bilingual dictionary, where
w ∈ V and w(cid:48) ∈ V (cid:48), with V and V (cid:48) representing
the vocabulary of the ﬁrst and second language,
respectively. For pairs (w, w(cid:48)) ∈ D, we can
simply compute the corresponding average vector
(cid:126)µw,w(cid:48) = (cid:126)vw+(cid:126)vw(cid:48)
. Then, using the pairs in D as
training data, we learn a linear mapping X such
that X(cid:126)vw ≈ (cid:126)µw,w(cid:48) for all (w, w(cid:48)) ∈ D. This map-
ping X can then be used to predict the averages
for words outside the given dictionary. To ﬁnd the
mapping X, we solve the following least squares
linear regression problem:

2

(cid:88)

E =

(w,w(cid:48))∈D

(cid:107)X (cid:126)w − (cid:126)µw,w(cid:48)(cid:107)2

(1)

Similarly, for the other language, we separately
learn a mapping X (cid:48) such that X (cid:48)(cid:126)vw(cid:48) ≈ (cid:126)µw,w(cid:48).

It is worth pointing out that we experimented
with several variants of this linear regression for-
mulation. For example, we also tried using a mul-
tilayer perceptron to learn non-linear mappings,
and we experimented with several regularization
terms to penalize mappings that deviate too much
from the identity mapping. None of these vari-
ants, however, were found to improve on the much
simpler formulation in (1), which can be solved
exactly and efﬁciently. Furthermore, one may
wonder whether the initial alignment is actually
needed, since e.g., Coates and Bollegala (2018)
obtained high-quality meta-embeddings without
such an alignment set. However, when applying
our approach directly to the initial monolingual
non-aligned embedding spaces, we obtained re-
sults which were competitive but slightly below
the two considered alignment strategies.

4 Evaluation

We test our bilingual embedding reﬁnement ap-
proach on both intrinsic and extrinsic tasks.
In
Section 4.1 we describe the common training
setup for all experiments and language pairs. The
languages we considered are English, Spanish,

Italian, German and Finnish. Throughout all the
experiments we use publicly available resources in
order to make comparisons and reproducibility of
our experiments easier.

4.1 Cross-lingual embeddings training

Corpora.
In our experiments we make use of
web-extracted corpora. For English we use the
3B-word UMBC WebBase Corpus (Han et al.,
2013), while we chose the Spanish Billion Words
Corpus (Cardellino, 2016) for Spanish. For Italian
and German, we use the itWaC and sdeWaC cor-
pora from the WaCky project (Baroni et al., 2009),
containing 2 and 0.8 billion words, respectively.2
Lastly, for Finnish, we use the Common Crawl
monolingual corpus from the Machine Translation
of News Shared Task 20163, composed of 2.8B
words. All corpora are tokenized and lowercased.

Monolingual embeddings.
The monolingual
word embeddings are trained with the Skipgram
model from FastText (Bojanowski et al., 2017) on
the corpora described above. The dimensionality
of the vectors was set to 300, with the default Fast-
Text hyperparameters.

Bilingual dictionaries. We use the bilingual
dictionaries packaged together by Artetxe et al.
(2017), each one conformed by 5000 word trans-
lations. They are used both for the initial bilingual
mappings and then again for our linear transfor-
mation.

Initial mapping. Following previous works, for
the purpose of obtaining the initial alignment, En-
glish is considered as source language and the
remaining languages are used as target. We
make use of the open-source implementations of
VecMap4 (Artetxe et al., 2017) and MUSE5 (Con-
neau et al., 2018), which constitute strong base-
lines for our experiments (cf. Section 3.1). Both
of them were used with the recommended parame-
ters and in their supervised setting, using the afore-
mentioned bilingual dictionaries.

Meeting in the Middle. Then, once the initial
cross-lingual embeddings are trained, and as ex-
plained in Section 3.2, we obtain our linear trans-
formation by using the exact solution to the least

cial corpora of the hypernym discovery SemEval task (Sec-
tion 4.2.3) for English, Spanish and Italian, respectively.

squares linear regression problem. To this end, we
use the same bilingual dictionaries as in the pre-
vious step. Henceforth, we will refer to our trans-
formed models as VecMapµ and MUSEµ, depend-
ing on the initial mapping.

4.2 Experiments

We test our cross-lingual word embeddings in
two intrinsic tasks, i.e., bilingual dictionary induc-
tion (Section 4.2.1) and word similarity (Section
4.2.2), and an extrinsic task, i.e., cross-lingual hy-
pernym discovery (Section 4.2.3).

4.2.1 Bilingual dictionary induction

The dictionary induction task consists in auto-
matically generating a bilingual dictionary from a
source to a target language, using as input a list of
words in the source language.

Experimental setting For this task, and follow-
ing previous works, we use the English-Italian test
set released by Dinu et al. (2015) and those re-
leased by Artetxe et al. (2017) for the remaining
language pairs. These test sets have no overlap
with respect to the training and development sets,
and contain around 1900 entries each. Given an
input word from the source language, word trans-
lations are retrieved through a nearest-neighbor
search of words in the target language, using co-
sine distance. Note that this gives us a ranked
list of candidates for each word from the source
language. Accordingly, the performance of the
embeddings is evaluated with the precision at k
(P @k) metric, which evaluates for what percent-
age of test pairs, the correct answer is among the
k highest ranked candidates.

Results As can be seen in Table 1, our reﬁne-
ment method consistently improves over the base-
lines (i.e., VecMap and MUSE) on all language
pairs and metrics. The higher scores indicate that
the two monolingual embedding spaces become
more tightly integrated because of our additional

transformation. It is worth highlighting here the
case of English-Finnish, where the gains obtained
in P @5 and P @10 are considerable. This might
indicate that our approach is especially useful for
morphologically richer languages such as Finnish,
where the limitations of the previous bilingual
mappings are most apparent.

Analysis When analyzing the source of errors in
P @1, we came to similar conclusions as Artetxe
et al. (2017).6 Several source words are translated
to words that are closely related to the one in the
gold reference in the target language; e.g., for the
English word essentially we obtain b´asicamente
(basically) instead of fundamentalmente (funda-
mentally) in Spanish, both of them closely re-
lated, or the closest neighbor for dirt being mu-
gre (dirt) instead of suciedad (dirt), which in fact
was among the ﬁve closest neighbors. We can also
ﬁnd multiple examples of the higher performance
of our models compared to the baselines. For in-
stance, in the English-Spanish cross-lingual mod-
els, after the initial alignment, we can ﬁnd that sec-
onds has minutos (minutes) as nearest neighbour,
but after applying our additional transformation,
seconds becomes closest to segundos (seconds).
Similarly, paint initially has tintado (tinted) as the
closest Spanish word, and then pintura (paint).

4.2.2 Word similarity

We perform experiments on both monolingual and
cross-lingual word similarity. In monolingual sim-
ilarity, models are tested in their ability to deter-
mine the similarity between two words in the same
language, whereas in cross-lingual similarity the
words belong to different languages. While in the
monolingual setting the main objective is to test
the quality of the monolingual subsets of the bilin-

6The results on this task are lower than those reported
in Artetxe et al. (2017). This is due to the different cor-
pora and embedding algorithms used to train the monolin-
gual embeddings. In particular, they use corpora including
Wikipedia, which is comparable across languages.

gual vector space, the cross-lingual setting consti-
tutes a straightforward benchmark to test the qual-
ity of bilingual embeddings.

Experimental setting For monolingual word
similarity we use the English SimLex-999 (Hill
et al., 2015), and the language-speciﬁc versions
of SemEval-177 (Camacho-Collados et al., 2017),
WordSim-3538 (Finkelstein et al., 2002), and RG-
65 (Rubenstein and Goodenough, 1965). The cor-
responding cross-lingual datasets from SemEval-
18, WordSim-353 and RG-65 were considered for
the cross-lingual word similarity evaluation9. Co-
sine similarity is again used as comparison mea-
sure.

Results Tables 2 and 3 show the monolingual10
and cross-lingual word similarity results11, respec-
tively. For both the monolingual and cross-lingual
settings, we can notice that our models generally
outperform the corresponding baselines. More-
over, in cases where no improvement is obtained,
the differences tend to be minimal, with the excep-
tion of RG-65, but this is a very small test set for
which larger variations can thus be expected. In
contrast, there are a few cases where substantial
gains were obtained by using our model. This is
most notable for English WordSim and SimLex in
the monolingual setting.

7The original datasets of SemEval-17 contained also mul-
tiwords, but for consistency we use the version containing
single words only.

8WordSim datasets consist of the similarity re-scoring
for several languages of Leviant and Reichart (2015), down-
loaded from http://leviants.com/ira.leviant/
MultilingualVSMdata.html

9The WordSim-353 and RG-65 cross-lingual datasets
(Camacho-Collados et al., 2015) were downloaded at http:
//lcl.uniroma1.it/similarity-datasets/

10The English results correspond to the averaged perfor-
mance of the English fragments of English-Spanish, English-
Italian and English-German cross-lingual embeddings.

11The results of the original VecMap in cross-lingual sim-
ilarity are comparable or better to those reported in Artetxe
et al. (2017) on the three datasets used in their evaluation.

In order

Analysis
to further understand the
movements of the space with respect to the orig-
inal VecMap and MUSE spaces, Figure 1 dis-
plays the average similarity values on the Se-
mEval cross-lingual datasets (the largest among
all benchmarks) of each model. As expected, the
ﬁgure clearly shows how our model consistently
brings the words from both languages closer on
all language pairs. Furthermore, this movement
is performed smoothly across all pairs, i.e., our
model does not make large changes to speciﬁc
words but rather small changes overall. This can
be veriﬁed by inspecting the standard deviation
of the difference in similarity after applying our
transformation. These standard deviation scores
range from 0.031 (English-Spanish for VecMap)
to 0.039 (English-Italian for MUSE), which are rel-
atively small given that the cosine similarity scale
ranges from -1 to 1.

As a complement of this analysis we show some
qualitative results which give us further insights on
the transformations of the vector space after our
average approximation. In particular, we analyze
the reasons behind the higher quality displayed
by our bilingual embeddings in monolingual set-
tings. While VecMap and MUSE do not trans-
form the initial monolingual spaces, our model
transforms both spaces simultaneously.
In this
analysis we focus on the source language of our
experiments (i.e., English). We found interest-
ing patterns which are learned by our model and

help understand these monolingual gains. For ex-
ample, a recurring pattern is that words in En-
glish which are translated to the same word, or
to semantically close words,
in the target lan-
guage end up closer together after our transfor-
mation. For example, in the case of English-
Spanish the following pairs were among the pairs
whose similarity increased the most by applying
our transformation: cellphone-telephone, movie-
ﬁlm, book-manuscript or rhythm-cadence, which
are either translated to the same word in Spanish
(i.e., tel´efono and pel´ıcula in the ﬁrst two cases)
or are already very close in the Spanish space.
More generally, we found that word pairs which
move together the most tend to be semantically
very similar and belong to the same domain, e.g.,
car-bicycle, opera-cinema, or snow-ice.

4.2.3 Cross-lingual hypernym discovery

Modeling hypernymy is a crucial task in NLP, with
direct applications in diverse areas such as seman-
tic search (Hoffart et al., 2014; Roller and Erk,
2016), question answering (Prager et al., 2008;
Yahya et al., 2013) or textual entailment (Geffet
and Dagan, 2005). Hypernyms, in addition, are the
backbone of lexical ontologies (Yu et al., 2015),
which are in turn useful for organizing, navigat-
ing and retrieving online content (Bordea et al.,
2016). Thus, we propose to evaluate the contribu-
tion of cross-lingual embeddings towards the task
of hypernym discovery, i.e., given an input word
(e.g., cat), retrieve or discover its most likely (set
of) valid hypernyms (e.g., animal, mammal, feline,
and so on). Intuitively, by leveraging a bilingual
vector space condensing the semantics of two lan-
guages, one of them being English, the need for
large amounts of training data in the target lan-
guage may be reduced.

and hypernym spaces, which is afterwards used
to predict the most likely (set of) hypernyms,
given an unseen hyponym. Training and evalu-
ation data come from the SemEval 2018 Shared
Task on Hypernym Discovery (Camacho-Collados
et al., 2018). Note that current state-of-the-art
systems aimed at modeling hypernymy (Shwartz
et al., 2016; Bernier-Colborne and Barriere, 2018)
combine large amounts of annotated data along
with language-speciﬁc rules and cue phrases such
as Hearst Patterns (Hearst, 1992), both of which
are generally scarcely (if at all) available for lan-
guages other than English. Therefore, we re-
port experiments with training data only from En-
glish (11,779 hyponym-hypernym pairs), and “en-
riched” models informed with relatively few train-
ing pairs (500, 1k and 2k) from the target lan-
guages. Evaluation is conducted with the same
metrics as in the original SemEval task, i.e., Mean
Reciprocal Rank (MRR), Mean Average Precision
(MAP) and Precision at 5 (P@5). These measures
explain a model’s behavior from complementary
prisms, namely how often at least one valid hy-
pernym was highly ranked (MRR), and in cases
where there is more than one correct hypernym,
to what extent they were all correctly retrieved
(MAP and P@5). Finally, as in the previous ex-
periments, we report comparative results between
our proposed models and the two competing base-
lines (VecMap and MUSE). As an additional in-
formative baseline, we include the highest scoring
unsupervised system at the SemEval task for both
Spanish and Italian (BestUns), which is based
on the distributional models described in Shwartz
et al. (2017).

Results The results listed in Table 4 indicate
several trends.12 First and foremost, in terms of

ear transformation matrix between the hyponym

12Note that this task is harder than hypernymy detection
(Upadhyay et al., 2018). Hypernymy detection is framed as
a binary classiﬁcation task, while in hypernym discovery hy-
pernyms have to be retrieved from the whole vocabulary.

our proposed model shows an improvement across
all conﬁgurations. However, in Spanish VecMap
emerges as a highly competitive baseline, with
our model only showing an improved performance
when training data in this language abounds (in
this speciﬁc case there is an increase from 17.2 to
19.5 points in the MRR metric). This suggests that
the fact that the monolingual spaces are closer in
our model is clearly beneﬁcial when hybrid train-
ing data is given as input, opening up avenues for
future work on weakly-supervised learning. Con-
cerning the other baseline, MUSE, the contribution
of our proposed model is consistent for both lan-
guages, again becoming more apparent in the Ital-
ian split and in a fully cross-lingual setting, where
the improvement in MRR is almost 3 points (from
10.6 to 13.3). Finally, it is noteworthy that even
in the setting where no training data from the tar-
get language is leveraged, all the systems based on
cross-lingual embeddings outperform the best un-
supervised baseline, which is a very encouraging
result with regards to solving tasks for languages
on which training data is not easily accessible or
not directly available.

Analysis A manual exploration of the results
obtained in cross-lingual hypernym discovery re-
veals a systematic pattern when comparing, for ex-

ample, VecMap and our model. It was shown in
Table 4 that the performance of our model grad-
ually increased alongside the size of the train-
ing data in the target language until surpassing
VecMap in the most informed conﬁguration (i.e.,
EN+2k). Speciﬁcally, our model seems to show a
higher presence of generic words in the output hy-
pernyms, which may be explained by these being

date hyponyms, our model correctly ﬁnds person
143 times, as compared to the 111 of VecMap,
and this systematically occurs with generic types
such as citizen or transport. Let us mention, how-
ever,
that the considered baselines perform re-
markably well in some cases. For example, the
English-only VecMap conﬁguration (EN), unlike
ours, correctly discovered the following hyper-
nyms for Francesc Maci`a (a Spanish politician
and soldier): politician, ruler, leader and person.
These were missing from the prediction of our
model in all conﬁgurations until the most informed
one (EN+2k).

5 Conclusions and Future Work

We have shown how to reﬁne bilingual word
embeddings by applying a simple transformation
which moves cross-lingual synonyms closer to-
wards their average representation. Before apply-
ing this strategy, we start by aligning the mono-
lingual embeddings of the two languages of in-
terest. For this initial alignment, we have consid-
ered two state-of-the-art methods from the litera-
ture, namely VecMap (Artetxe et al., 2017) and
MUSE (Conneau et al., 2018), which also served
as our baselines. Our approach is motivated by the
fact that these alignment methods do not change
the structure of the individual monolingual spaces.
However, the internal structure of embeddings is,
at least to some extent, language-speciﬁc, and is
moreover affected by biases of the corpus from
which they are trained, meaning that after the ini-
tial alignment signiﬁcant gaps remain between the
representations of cross-lingual synonyms. We
tested our approach on a wide array of datasets
from different tasks (i.e., bilingual dictionary in-
duction, word similarity and cross-lingual hyper-
nym discovery) with state-of-the-art results.

This paper opens up several promising avenues
for future work. First, even though both lan-
guages are currently being treated symmetrically,
the initial monolingual embedding of one of the

languages may be more reliable than that of the
In such cases, it may be of interest to
other.
replace the vectors (cid:126)µw,w(cid:48) by a weighted aver-
age of the monolingual word vectors. Second,
while we have only considered bilingual scenar-
ios in this paper, our approach can naturally be ap-
plied to scenarios involving more languages.
In
this case, we would ﬁrst choose a single target
language, and obtain alignments between all the
other languages and this target language. To ap-
ply our model, we can then simply learn map-
pings to predict averaged word vectors across all
languages. Finally, it would also be interesting to
use the obtained embeddings in downstream ap-
plications such as language identiﬁcation or cross-
lingual sentiment analysis, and extend our analy-
sis to other languages, with a particular focus on
morphologically-rich languages (after seeing our
success with Finnish), for which the bilingual in-
duction task has proved more challenging for stan-
dard cross-lingual embedding models (Søgaard
et al., 2018).
