Abstract
This article presents the data collected and ASR systems developped for 4 sub-saharan african languages (Swahili, Hausa, Amharic and
Wolof). To illustrate our methodology, the focus is made on Wolof (a very under-resourced language) for which we designed the ﬁrst
ASR system ever built in this language. All data and scripts are available online on our github repository.

Introduction

Today is very favorable to the development of a market for
speech in sub-saharan african languages. People’s access
to information and communications technologies (ICT) is
done mainly through mobile (and keyboard) and the need
for voice services can be found in all sectors, from higher
priority (health, food) to more fun (games, social media).
For this, overcoming the language barrier is needed. This
paper is done in the context of ALFFA project1 where two
main aspects are involved: fundamentals of speech anal-
ysis (language phonetic and linguistic description, dialec-
tology) and speech technologies (automatic speech recog-
nition (ASR) and text-to-speech (TTS)) for African lan-
guages. In the project, developed ASR and TTS technolo-
gies will be used to build micro speech services for mobile
phones in Africa. For this, speech fundamental knowledge
for targeted languages has to be upgraded while African
language technologies are still at their very beginning. For
these reasons, the ALFFA project is really interdisciplinary
since it does not only gather technology experts but also in-
cludes ﬁeldwork linguists/phoneticians.
Paper contribution. This article presents the data col-
lected and ASR systems developped for 4 sub-saharan
african languages (Swahili, Hausa, Amharic and Wolof).
To illustrate our methodology, the focus is made on Wolof
(a very under-resourced language) for which we designed
the ﬁrst ASR system ever built in this language.
Paper outline. The outline of this paper is the follow-
ing: ﬁrst, section 2 will summarize ASR sytems already
available on our github2 repository for Swahili, Hausa and
Amharic (together with scripts and resources needed to re-
produce ASR experiments). Then, sections 3, 4 and 5 will
focus respectively on text data collection, speech data col-
lection and ASR for Wolof language. Finally, section 6 will
conclude this work and give some perspectives.

2. ASR systems made available in the

ALFFA project
2.1. Target languages of the project
Language choice for the project is mainly governed by pop-
ulation coverage and industrial perspectives. We focus on
Hausa spoken by around 60 million people, as ﬁrst or sec-
ond language. Hausa is part of the family of Afroasiatic
languages. Speciﬁcally, Hausa is the most spoken language
among the Chadic languages (Vycichl, 1990). It is the ofﬁ-
cial language of northern Nigeria (around 30 million speak-
ers) and a national language of Niger (around 9 million
speakers) but is also spoken in Ghana, Benin, Cameroon,
Togo, Chad and Burkina Faso (Koslow, 1995). Hausa is
considered to be a common language of West Africa and
Central Africa: it is spoken in many large commercial cities
such as Dakar, Abidjan, Lome, Ouagadougou or Bamako.
Hausa is a tonal language. About a quarter of the Hausa
words comes from the Arabic language but Hausa was also
inﬂuenced by French. Hausa can be written with the Arabic
spelling since the beginning of the 17th century. This writ-
ing system is called ’Ajami. However, the ofﬁcial spelling
is based on the Latin alphabet called Boko. There are dif-
ferent varieties of Hausa, depending on whether it is spoken
in eastern (i.e: Kano, Zaria, Bauchi, Daura), western (i.e:
Sokoto, Gobir, Tahoua), northern (i.e: Katsina, Maradi,
Zinder) or southern (i.e: Zaria, Bauci) areas.
Enlarging the subregion coverage, we also consider Bam-
bara, Wolof, and Fula languages, to cover major West
African languages. All the languages targeted cover more
than half of the 300 million people of West Africa.
Bambara (or Bamanankan) is largely spoken in West Africa
by around 40 million people. It is mainly spoken in Mali
with 4 million speakers (census from the SIL3 in 2012) and
is used as a lingua franca. The Bambara is an agglutinative
language. It uses the Roman script written system and is a
tonal language.
Wolof belongs to the Atlantic languages which is part of the

3see https://www.ethnologue.com/

3863

Niger-Congo phylum. This language is spoken in Senegal,
Gambia and Mauritania where it is considered as a national
language. In addition, Wolof is considered as one of the
common languages and is spoken by 10 million people in
total. More details on the language are given in the section
3.1..
Fula is a set of dialects spoken in all West Africa coun-
tries by 70 million people. They include both tonal and
non-tonal languages. In the ALFFA project, we have de-
cided to focus on Pulaar, the western dialect of the fula lan-
guages. Like the Wolof, the Pulaar belongs to the Atlantic
languages which is part of the Niger-Congo phylum. The
dialect is mainly spoken in Senegal by almost 3.5 million
speakers (census in 2015 from the SIL) but also in dozens
of other African countries. The Pulaar dialect use the Latin-
based orthography.
As far as East Africa is concerned, we designed ASR sys-
tem for Swahili which is the most widespread language in
the East of the continent: spoken by more than 100 million
people4. Swahili (or Kiswahili) belongs to the Niger-Congo
phylum. It is the most spoken language among the Bantu
language: it is used as a ﬁrst language but also as a common
language by a large population. In Tanzania, the language
has an ofﬁcial status but Swahili is a national language in
numerous East and Central Africa. For centuries the Arabic
script has been used to written the Swahili but currently the
standard written system is based on Latin script.
We also work on Amharic, a Semitic language which is part
of the Afro-asiatic phylum. It is the second most spoken
language among the Semitic languages. It is spoken mostly
in Ethiopia by 22 million speakers (census from the SIL in
2010) where the language has an ofﬁcial status. Amharic
uses an alphasyllabary written system named ﬁdel :
the
consonant-vowel sequence represents a discrete unit (Com-
rie, 2009).

2.2. Automatic Speech Recognition for 3

languages

ASR systems for Swahili, Hausa and Amharic have been
built so far. All the data and scripts to build a complete
ASR system for these 3 languages are already available to
the public on the github repository already mentioned in
section 1. We used Kaldi speech recognition toolkit (Povey
et al., 2011) for building our ASR systems. For the Swahili
and Amharic ASR systems, the transcribed speech corpora,
pronunciation lexicons and language models (LMs) are also
made available while for Hausa ASR, users need to buy the
corpus and the lexicon at ELDA ﬁrst.
The ASR for Swahili was trained on about 10 hours of
speech and the evaluation was done on about 1.8 hours. The
language model was trained on text data grabbed from on-
line newspaper (about 28M words) and cleaned as much as
it could. More details on the Swahili corpus and how it was
collected can be found on (Gelas et al., 2010).
For Hausa, the GlobalPhone Speech Corpus (Schlippe et
al., 2012) was used. About 7 hours of data was used to
train the system and 1 hour to evaluate it. The language
model is composed of transcribed speech data from Glob-
alphone corpus (41k words) and was converted into lower

4see http://swahililanguage.stanford.edu

case. Finally, the lexicon contains 42,662 entries.
The Amharic system was retrained from the corpus de-
scribed in (Tachbelie et al., 2014) and represents about 20
hours of speech data, while the testing set represents about
2 hours. Concerning the language model, it was created
using SRILM using 3-grams and the text is segmented in
morphemes using Morfessor 2.0 (Creutz and Lagus, 2002).
A summary of the ASR performance (measured with Word
Error rate (WER)) obtained for the three languages is given
on table 1 but more experimental details can be found in the
README ﬁles of the Github repository.

3. Collecting text in Wolof

3.1. Our focus: Wolof language
As we said in 2.1., Wolof is mainly spoken in Senegal but
also in Gambia and Mauritania. Even if people who speaks
Wolof understand each other, the Senegalese Wolof and
the Gambian Wolof are two distincts languages: both own
their ISO 639-3 language code (respectively ”WOL” and
”WOF”). For our studies, we decided to focus on Sene-
galese Wolof, and more precisely on the urban Wolof spo-
ken in Dakar.
About 90% of the Senegalese people speak Wolof, while al-
most 40% of the population uses it as their mother tongue5.
Wolof is originally used as an oral language. The writing
system was developed at a later time, in Arabic orthogra-
phy named Wolofal ﬁrst (back to the pre-colonial period,
through Islam spreading) and then in Latin orthography
(through pre-colonial period). Nowadays, the latter is of-
ﬁcially in use. 29 Roman-based characters are used from
the Latin script and most of them are involved in digraphs
standing for geminate and prenasalized stops. Wolof is a
non-tonal language, with no diphthong and a moderate syl-
labic complexity.
The ofﬁcial language in Senegal is French. By deﬁnition,
it is the language used in all the Institutions of the gov-
ernment like administrations and all administrative papers,
courts, schools, etc. Consequently, Wolof is not learned at
school. The orthography has no real standard rules and can
be written in many ways. We will see later in this paper that
it causes some problems in ASR. Nonetheless, the Center
of Applied Linguistics of Dakar (CLAD)6, coordinates the
orthographic standardization of the Wolof language.
Finally, very few electronic documents are available for this
language. We started from a ﬁrst set of initial documents
gathered as part of (Nouguier Voisin, 2002) and then tried
to collect Wolof text from the Web.

Initial documents available

3.2.
First of all,
to build a textual corpus in
Wolof, we used some texts collected for the purpose of
(Nouguier Voisin, 2002). It gathers proverbs (Becker et al.,
2000), stories from (Kesteloot and Dieng, 1989), transcripts
of debates about healers, a song entitled ”Baay de Ouza”
and two dictionaries: ”Dictionnaire wolof-franc¸ais” writ-
ten by Aram Fal, Rosine Santos, Jean-L´eonce Doneux (Fal
et al., 1990) and ”Dictionnaire wolof-franc¸ais et franc¸ais-
wolof” by Jean L´eopold Diouf (Diouf, 2003). These ﬁles
were in different formats such as PDF, MS Word/Excel,
HTML, etc.
We extracted all these documents to TXT format. We post-
processed them by converting text into lower case and by
cleaning them from non-wolof data (like section number-
ing, numbered list, french notes, etc.) and punctuation.
Overall, it represents an overall usable text corpus of 20,162
utterances (147,801 words).

3.3. Retrieving data from the Web
148k words is small for statistical language modeling, so
we decided to collect more text data in Wolof using the
Web. Very few documents written in Wolof are actually
available. In addition, we looked for well-structured data
(in accordance with syntactic rules). For this purpose, we
found some PDF ﬁles from educational, religious and news
websites. We have extracted contents from the Univer-
sal Declaration of Human Rights, the Bible and a book
written by an humanist in TXT format.
In term of post-
processing, we removed symbols, punctuation characters
and non meaningful text (like section numbering, numbered
list, etc.) from the collected texts and converted characters
to lower case. In total, we got 197,430 additional words.
Also, given the limited data manually found, we decided
to crawl the Wikipedia database to collect a larger amount
of data in Wolof. We retrieved all the articles indexed in
the Wolof language using Wikipedia Extractor (Attardi and
Fuschetto, 2013). As this kind of open database is only
lightly supervised, some articles can be multilingual. To
remove non Wolof text, we applied the Google Compact
Language Detector (CLD2)7. As CLD2 cannot recognize
Wolof but can detect the most widely used languages, we
used the tool to ﬁlter out the non Wolof languages detected
(and hypothesized that the remaining documents were in
Wolof). To improve the precision on Wolof text retrieval,
we also applied a data selection tool called Xenc (Rousseau,
2013). After these two ﬁltering passes and quick man-
ual cleaning, we obtained an additional collection of about
311k words.
Table 2 summarizes the data ﬁnally retrieved from the Web.

4. Audio corpus in Wolof

From our initial
textual corpus (developed in section
3.2.), we randomly extracted a corpus of 6,000 utterances
with length between 6 and 12 words. Then, from this
small homogeneous corpus we extracted 18 sub-corpora
of 1,000 utterances that will be used as recording ses-
sions. We took advantage of the TTS recording campaign
in Dakar (Senegal) of our project partner Voxygen to col-
lect our read speech corpus. They recorded for us 18 na-
tives Wolof speakers (10 male, 8 female) from different
socio-professional categories (journalist, student, manager,
teacher, teleoperator) and from 24 to 48 years old, using
a Samson G-track microphone in a clean environment. A
sociolinguistic questionnaire was also collected for each
speaker.
The 18,000 recorded utterances represent 21h22mn of sig-
nal. We chose 14 speakers for the traning set, 2 for the
development set and 2 for the testing set. We checked that
each set was composed of an equivalent quantity of literary
genre.
Training / development / testing partition is given in table

5. First ASR system for Wolof
We built two language models. The ﬁrst 3-gram model
we trained with SRILM toolkit (Stolcke and others, 2002)
was trained on 106,206 words (11,065 unigrams). These
training data have been generated from the initial text cor-
pus (20,162 utterances represented by 147,801 words) from
which we removed utterances used for the speech record-
ings (41,595 words removed). The perplexity of the lan-
guage model is 294 on the dev set (7.1% of OOVs) and 301
on the test set (7.2% of OOVs). This model will be called
LM1 in the next sections. The second 3-gram language
model trained with SRILM toolkit is an interpolation be-
tween the ﬁrst one and another built from the data collected
on the Web (509k) cleaned, mentioned in 3.3..
It ﬁnally
corresponds to 601,609 words (29,148 unique words). Its
perplexity is 314 (5.4% of OOVs) on the dev set and 323
(5.1% of OOVs) on the test set. This model will be called
LM2 in the next sections. The table 4 summarizes the lan-
guage models built so far.

Regarding the pronunciation dictionary, we used a seed
of 8,724 entries corresponding to the concatenation of the

3865

the HMM/GMM system,

entries phonetically transcribed in (Fal et al., 1990) and
(Diouf, 2003). From this, we trained a 7-gram pronunci-
ation model for Wolof using Phonetisaurus (Novak, 2011),
a Grapheme-to-Phoneme (G2P) conversion system, which
allows us to automatically transcribe into phonetic sym-
bols the remaining vocabulary of the LMs not phonetized
yet. The vocabulary that covers LM1 language model is
made of 15,575 entries (including 302 variants) while the
one for LM2 has 32,039 entries. Each pronunciation dic-
tionary was used both for training and decoding stages.
We used Kaldi speech recognition toolkit for building our
ASR systems (and consequently, acoustic models). Three
systems based on different acoustic modeling techniques
were built: one based on the classical hidden Markov model
and Gaussian mixture model (HMM/GMM) approach, one
based on the subspace Gaussian mixture model (SGMM)
approach and another one using deep neural networks
(DNNs).
For
the acoustic models
were built using 13 Mel-frequency cepstrum coefﬁcients
(MFCCs) and Gaussian mixture models on 16.8h train-
ing data. We trained triphone models by employing 3,401
context-dependent states and 40k Gaussians. Besides that,
we implemented delta delta coefﬁcients on the MFCCs, lin-
ear discriminant analysis (LDA) transformation and max-
imum likelihood transform (MLLT) (Gopinath, 1998), as
well as speaker adaptation based on feature-space maxi-
mum likelihood linear regression (fMLLR) (Gales, 1998).
To build DNNs, we trained the network using state-level
minimum Bayes risk (Kingsbury, 2009) (sMBR) and the
network had seven layers, each of the six hidden layers had
1024 hidden units. The network was trained from 11 con-
secutive frames (5 preceding and 5 following frames) of
the same MFCCs as in the GMM systems. Furthermore,
same HMM states were used as targets of the DNN. The ini-
tial weights for the network were obtained using Restricted
Boltzmann Machines (RBMs) (Hinton, 2010) then ﬁne tun-
ing was done using Stochastic Gradient Descent.

We can see in the table 5 the performance for the ﬁrst Wolof
ASR system trained using HMM/GMM, SGMM and DNN
approaches. These baseline performances show that our
ﬁrst Wolof ASR system can reach WER around 30%. Since
we have only two speakers per evaluation set, the stan-
dard deviation is large. Indeed, we observed until 6% of
WER difference between speakers, on both dev and test
sets. Also, results are close between language models. Our
hypothesis is that LM2 does not provide much better per-

formances because it comes for the most part from the Web,
thus the vocabulary and syntax are much different from
the ones of the speech corpus (similar to LM1). We ob-
serve, however, a small improvement of the performance
with LM2 compared to LM1. We also analysed the outputs
of the ASR systems and found that many errors are due to
normalization issues in the text. Wolof is a morphologi-
cally complex language and some errors can appear at this
stage. In addition, as we said in 3.1., a same word can have
several surface forms, especially when it contains diacrit-
ics. For example, the word ”j´el” can also be written ”j¨el”
and mean ”took” or ”steal”. Also, the word ”randal” can be
written ”r`andal” and mean the same: ”keep away”, but can
also be spelled ”dandal”. About this problem of orthogra-
phy, the word ”c´eetal” for example can be spelled ”s´etal”
and means ”organise the wedding”. Concerning diacritics,
we also evaluate WER by removing all of them on both hy-
pothesis and references. The results are also provided in
table 5. WERs are slightly lower in that case and the dif-
ference between both numbers (WER with/w-o diacritics)
corresponds to diacritic errors. Moreover, we can observe
that DNNs bring some improvements on the dev set but not
on the test set in comparison with the SGMMs.

6. Conclusion

This paper presented the data collected and ASR systems
developped for 4 sub-saharan african languages (Swahili,
Hausa, Amharic and Wolof). All data and scripts are avail-
able online on our github8 repository. More precisely, we
focus on Wolof language by explaining our text and speech
collection methodology. We trained two language models:
one from some data we already owned and another one
with the addition of data crawled from the Web. Finally,
we present the ﬁrst ASR system ever built in this language.
The system which obtains the best score is the one using
the LM2 and the DNNs, for which we got 27.21% of WER.
Perspectives. In the short run, we intend to improve the
quality of the LM2 by using neural networks. We also
currently work on a duration model for the Wolof and the
Hausa ASR systems.
In the medium term, we want to deal with text normal-
ization. As we have seen, words can have several sur-
face forms and can be written in many ways. By selecting
one among a number of several possible variants, we want
to normalize the orthography of our corpus. We expect
that this desambigation will allow to reduce the number of
OOVs and improve the quality of our language model.
Last but not least, we continually develop and improve Lig-
Aikuma (Blachon et al., 2016), a fork of the Aikuma appli-
cation (Bird et al., 2014). Lig-Aikuma is destinated to ﬁeld
linguists and is designed to make the data collection work
easier and faster. Through the use of this application, we
will check, by an expert of the Wolof, our data collected
(right correspondence between the audio ﬁle and its tran-
scription) to assess our system on more reliable data.

Abstract
This article presents the data collected and ASR systems developped for 4 sub-saharan african languages (Swahili, Hausa, Amharic and
Wolof). To illustrate our methodology, the focus is made on Wolof (a very under-resourced language) for which we designed the ﬁrst
ASR system ever built in this language. All data and scripts are available online on our github repository.

Introduction

Today is very favorable to the development of a market for
speech in sub-saharan african languages. People’s access
to information and communications technologies (ICT) is
done mainly through mobile (and keyboard) and the need
for voice services can be found in all sectors, from higher
priority (health, food) to more fun (games, social media).
For this, overcoming the language barrier is needed. This
paper is done in the context of ALFFA project1 where two
main aspects are involved: fundamentals of speech anal-
ysis (language phonetic and linguistic description, dialec-
tology) and speech technologies (automatic speech recog-
nition (ASR) and text-to-speech (TTS)) for African lan-
guages. In the project, developed ASR and TTS technolo-
gies will be used to build micro speech services for mobile
phones in Africa. For this, speech fundamental knowledge
for targeted languages has to be upgraded while African
language technologies are still at their very beginning. For
these reasons, the ALFFA project is really interdisciplinary
since it does not only gather technology experts but also in-
cludes ﬁeldwork linguists/phoneticians.
Paper contribution. This article presents the data col-
lected and ASR systems developped for 4 sub-saharan
african languages (Swahili, Hausa, Amharic and Wolof).
To illustrate our methodology, the focus is made on Wolof
(a very under-resourced language) for which we designed
the ﬁrst ASR system ever built in this language.
Paper outline. The outline of this paper is the follow-
ing: ﬁrst, section 2 will summarize ASR sytems already
available on our github2 repository for Swahili, Hausa and
Amharic (together with scripts and resources needed to re-
produce ASR experiments). Then, sections 3, 4 and 5 will
focus respectively on text data collection, speech data col-
lection and ASR for Wolof language. Finally, section 6 will
conclude this work and give some perspectives.

2. ASR systems made available in the

ALFFA project
2.1. Target languages of the project
Language choice for the project is mainly governed by pop-
ulation coverage and industrial perspectives. We focus on
Hausa spoken by around 60 million people, as ﬁrst or sec-
ond language. Hausa is part of the family of Afroasiatic
languages. Speciﬁcally, Hausa is the most spoken language
among the Chadic languages (Vycichl, 1990). It is the ofﬁ-
cial language of northern Nigeria (around 30 million speak-
ers) and a national language of Niger (around 9 million
speakers) but is also spoken in Ghana, Benin, Cameroon,
Togo, Chad and Burkina Faso (Koslow, 1995). Hausa is
considered to be a common language of West Africa and
Central Africa: it is spoken in many large commercial cities
such as Dakar, Abidjan, Lome, Ouagadougou or Bamako.
Hausa is a tonal language. About a quarter of the Hausa
words comes from the Arabic language but Hausa was also
inﬂuenced by French. Hausa can be written with the Arabic
spelling since the beginning of the 17th century. This writ-
ing system is called ’Ajami. However, the ofﬁcial spelling
is based on the Latin alphabet called Boko. There are dif-
ferent varieties of Hausa, depending on whether it is spoken
in eastern (i.e: Kano, Zaria, Bauchi, Daura), western (i.e:
Sokoto, Gobir, Tahoua), northern (i.e: Katsina, Maradi,
Zinder) or southern (i.e: Zaria, Bauci) areas.
Enlarging the subregion coverage, we also consider Bam-
bara, Wolof, and Fula languages, to cover major West
African languages. All the languages targeted cover more
than half of the 300 million people of West Africa.
Bambara (or Bamanankan) is largely spoken in West Africa
by around 40 million people. It is mainly spoken in Mali
with 4 million speakers (census from the SIL3 in 2012) and
is used as a lingua franca. The Bambara is an agglutinative
language. It uses the Roman script written system and is a
tonal language.
Wolof belongs to the Atlantic languages which is part of the

3see https://www.ethnologue.com/

3863

Niger-Congo phylum. This language is spoken in Senegal,
Gambia and Mauritania where it is considered as a national
language. In addition, Wolof is considered as one of the
common languages and is spoken by 10 million people in
total. More details on the language are given in the section
3.1..
Fula is a set of dialects spoken in all West Africa coun-
tries by 70 million people. They include both tonal and
non-tonal languages. In the ALFFA project, we have de-
cided to focus on Pulaar, the western dialect of the fula lan-
guages. Like the Wolof, the Pulaar belongs to the Atlantic
languages which is part of the Niger-Congo phylum. The
dialect is mainly spoken in Senegal by almost 3.5 million
speakers (census in 2015 from the SIL) but also in dozens
of other African countries. The Pulaar dialect use the Latin-
based orthography.
As far as East Africa is concerned, we designed ASR sys-
tem for Swahili which is the most widespread language in
the East of the continent: spoken by more than 100 million
people4. Swahili (or Kiswahili) belongs to the Niger-Congo
phylum. It is the most spoken language among the Bantu
language: it is used as a ﬁrst language but also as a common
language by a large population. In Tanzania, the language
has an ofﬁcial status but Swahili is a national language in
numerous East and Central Africa. For centuries the Arabic
script has been used to written the Swahili but currently the
standard written system is based on Latin script.
We also work on Amharic, a Semitic language which is part
of the Afro-asiatic phylum. It is the second most spoken
language among the Semitic languages. It is spoken mostly
in Ethiopia by 22 million speakers (census from the SIL in
2010) where the language has an ofﬁcial status. Amharic
uses an alphasyllabary written system named ﬁdel :
the
consonant-vowel sequence represents a discrete unit (Com-
rie, 2009).

2.2. Automatic Speech Recognition for 3

languages

ASR systems for Swahili, Hausa and Amharic have been
built so far. All the data and scripts to build a complete
ASR system for these 3 languages are already available to
the public on the github repository already mentioned in
section 1. We used Kaldi speech recognition toolkit (Povey
et al., 2011) for building our ASR systems. For the Swahili
and Amharic ASR systems, the transcribed speech corpora,
pronunciation lexicons and language models (LMs) are also
made available while for Hausa ASR, users need to buy the
corpus and the lexicon at ELDA ﬁrst.
The ASR for Swahili was trained on about 10 hours of
speech and the evaluation was done on about 1.8 hours. The
language model was trained on text data grabbed from on-
line newspaper (about 28M words) and cleaned as much as
it could. More details on the Swahili corpus and how it was
collected can be found on (Gelas et al., 2010).
For Hausa, the GlobalPhone Speech Corpus (Schlippe et
al., 2012) was used. About 7 hours of data was used to
train the system and 1 hour to evaluate it. The language
model is composed of transcribed speech data from Glob-
alphone corpus (41k words) and was converted into lower

4see http://swahililanguage.stanford.edu

case. Finally, the lexicon contains 42,662 entries.
The Amharic system was retrained from the corpus de-
scribed in (Tachbelie et al., 2014) and represents about 20
hours of speech data, while the testing set represents about
2 hours. Concerning the language model, it was created
using SRILM using 3-grams and the text is segmented in
morphemes using Morfessor 2.0 (Creutz and Lagus, 2002).
A summary of the ASR performance (measured with Word
Error rate (WER)) obtained for the three languages is given
on table 1 but more experimental details can be found in the
README ﬁles of the Github repository.

3. Collecting text in Wolof

3.1. Our focus: Wolof language
As we said in 2.1., Wolof is mainly spoken in Senegal but
also in Gambia and Mauritania. Even if people who speaks
Wolof understand each other, the Senegalese Wolof and
the Gambian Wolof are two distincts languages: both own
their ISO 639-3 language code (respectively ”WOL” and
”WOF”). For our studies, we decided to focus on Sene-
galese Wolof, and more precisely on the urban Wolof spo-
ken in Dakar.
About 90% of the Senegalese people speak Wolof, while al-
most 40% of the population uses it as their mother tongue5.
Wolof is originally used as an oral language. The writing
system was developed at a later time, in Arabic orthogra-
phy named Wolofal ﬁrst (back to the pre-colonial period,
through Islam spreading) and then in Latin orthography
(through pre-colonial period). Nowadays, the latter is of-
ﬁcially in use. 29 Roman-based characters are used from
the Latin script and most of them are involved in digraphs
standing for geminate and prenasalized stops. Wolof is a
non-tonal language, with no diphthong and a moderate syl-
labic complexity.
The ofﬁcial language in Senegal is French. By deﬁnition,
it is the language used in all the Institutions of the gov-
ernment like administrations and all administrative papers,
courts, schools, etc. Consequently, Wolof is not learned at
school. The orthography has no real standard rules and can
be written in many ways. We will see later in this paper that
it causes some problems in ASR. Nonetheless, the Center
of Applied Linguistics of Dakar (CLAD)6, coordinates the
orthographic standardization of the Wolof language.
Finally, very few electronic documents are available for this
language. We started from a ﬁrst set of initial documents
gathered as part of (Nouguier Voisin, 2002) and then tried
to collect Wolof text from the Web.

Initial documents available

3.2.
First of all,
to build a textual corpus in
Wolof, we used some texts collected for the purpose of
(Nouguier Voisin, 2002). It gathers proverbs (Becker et al.,
2000), stories from (Kesteloot and Dieng, 1989), transcripts
of debates about healers, a song entitled ”Baay de Ouza”
and two dictionaries: ”Dictionnaire wolof-franc¸ais” writ-
ten by Aram Fal, Rosine Santos, Jean-L´eonce Doneux (Fal
et al., 1990) and ”Dictionnaire wolof-franc¸ais et franc¸ais-
wolof” by Jean L´eopold Diouf (Diouf, 2003). These ﬁles
were in different formats such as PDF, MS Word/Excel,
HTML, etc.
We extracted all these documents to TXT format. We post-
processed them by converting text into lower case and by
cleaning them from non-wolof data (like section number-
ing, numbered list, french notes, etc.) and punctuation.
Overall, it represents an overall usable text corpus of 20,162
utterances (147,801 words).

3.3. Retrieving data from the Web
148k words is small for statistical language modeling, so
we decided to collect more text data in Wolof using the
Web. Very few documents written in Wolof are actually
available. In addition, we looked for well-structured data
(in accordance with syntactic rules). For this purpose, we
found some PDF ﬁles from educational, religious and news
websites. We have extracted contents from the Univer-
sal Declaration of Human Rights, the Bible and a book
written by an humanist in TXT format.
In term of post-
processing, we removed symbols, punctuation characters
and non meaningful text (like section numbering, numbered
list, etc.) from the collected texts and converted characters
to lower case. In total, we got 197,430 additional words.
Also, given the limited data manually found, we decided
to crawl the Wikipedia database to collect a larger amount
of data in Wolof. We retrieved all the articles indexed in
the Wolof language using Wikipedia Extractor (Attardi and
Fuschetto, 2013). As this kind of open database is only
lightly supervised, some articles can be multilingual. To
remove non Wolof text, we applied the Google Compact
Language Detector (CLD2)7. As CLD2 cannot recognize
Wolof but can detect the most widely used languages, we
used the tool to ﬁlter out the non Wolof languages detected
(and hypothesized that the remaining documents were in
Wolof). To improve the precision on Wolof text retrieval,
we also applied a data selection tool called Xenc (Rousseau,
2013). After these two ﬁltering passes and quick man-
ual cleaning, we obtained an additional collection of about
311k words.
Table 2 summarizes the data ﬁnally retrieved from the Web.

4. Audio corpus in Wolof

From our initial
textual corpus (developed in section
3.2.), we randomly extracted a corpus of 6,000 utterances
with length between 6 and 12 words. Then, from this
small homogeneous corpus we extracted 18 sub-corpora
of 1,000 utterances that will be used as recording ses-
sions. We took advantage of the TTS recording campaign
in Dakar (Senegal) of our project partner Voxygen to col-
lect our read speech corpus. They recorded for us 18 na-
tives Wolof speakers (10 male, 8 female) from different
socio-professional categories (journalist, student, manager,
teacher, teleoperator) and from 24 to 48 years old, using
a Samson G-track microphone in a clean environment. A
sociolinguistic questionnaire was also collected for each
speaker.
The 18,000 recorded utterances represent 21h22mn of sig-
nal. We chose 14 speakers for the traning set, 2 for the
development set and 2 for the testing set. We checked that
each set was composed of an equivalent quantity of literary
genre.
Training / development / testing partition is given in table

5. First ASR system for Wolof
We built two language models. The ﬁrst 3-gram model
we trained with SRILM toolkit (Stolcke and others, 2002)
was trained on 106,206 words (11,065 unigrams). These
training data have been generated from the initial text cor-
pus (20,162 utterances represented by 147,801 words) from
which we removed utterances used for the speech record-
ings (41,595 words removed). The perplexity of the lan-
guage model is 294 on the dev set (7.1% of OOVs) and 301
on the test set (7.2% of OOVs). This model will be called
LM1 in the next sections. The second 3-gram language
model trained with SRILM toolkit is an interpolation be-
tween the ﬁrst one and another built from the data collected
on the Web (509k) cleaned, mentioned in 3.3..
It ﬁnally
corresponds to 601,609 words (29,148 unique words). Its
perplexity is 314 (5.4% of OOVs) on the dev set and 323
(5.1% of OOVs) on the test set. This model will be called
LM2 in the next sections. The table 4 summarizes the lan-
guage models built so far.

Regarding the pronunciation dictionary, we used a seed
of 8,724 entries corresponding to the concatenation of the

3865

the HMM/GMM system,

entries phonetically transcribed in (Fal et al., 1990) and
(Diouf, 2003). From this, we trained a 7-gram pronunci-
ation model for Wolof using Phonetisaurus (Novak, 2011),
a Grapheme-to-Phoneme (G2P) conversion system, which
allows us to automatically transcribe into phonetic sym-
bols the remaining vocabulary of the LMs not phonetized
yet. The vocabulary that covers LM1 language model is
made of 15,575 entries (including 302 variants) while the
one for LM2 has 32,039 entries. Each pronunciation dic-
tionary was used both for training and decoding stages.
We used Kaldi speech recognition toolkit for building our
ASR systems (and consequently, acoustic models). Three
systems based on different acoustic modeling techniques
were built: one based on the classical hidden Markov model
and Gaussian mixture model (HMM/GMM) approach, one
based on the subspace Gaussian mixture model (SGMM)
approach and another one using deep neural networks
(DNNs).
For
the acoustic models
were built using 13 Mel-frequency cepstrum coefﬁcients
(MFCCs) and Gaussian mixture models on 16.8h train-
ing data. We trained triphone models by employing 3,401
context-dependent states and 40k Gaussians. Besides that,
we implemented delta delta coefﬁcients on the MFCCs, lin-
ear discriminant analysis (LDA) transformation and max-
imum likelihood transform (MLLT) (Gopinath, 1998), as
well as speaker adaptation based on feature-space maxi-
mum likelihood linear regression (fMLLR) (Gales, 1998).
To build DNNs, we trained the network using state-level
minimum Bayes risk (Kingsbury, 2009) (sMBR) and the
network had seven layers, each of the six hidden layers had
1024 hidden units. The network was trained from 11 con-
secutive frames (5 preceding and 5 following frames) of
the same MFCCs as in the GMM systems. Furthermore,
same HMM states were used as targets of the DNN. The ini-
tial weights for the network were obtained using Restricted
Boltzmann Machines (RBMs) (Hinton, 2010) then ﬁne tun-
ing was done using Stochastic Gradient Descent.

We can see in the table 5 the performance for the ﬁrst Wolof
ASR system trained using HMM/GMM, SGMM and DNN
approaches. These baseline performances show that our
ﬁrst Wolof ASR system can reach WER around 30%. Since
we have only two speakers per evaluation set, the stan-
dard deviation is large. Indeed, we observed until 6% of
WER difference between speakers, on both dev and test
sets. Also, results are close between language models. Our
hypothesis is that LM2 does not provide much better per-

formances because it comes for the most part from the Web,
thus the vocabulary and syntax are much different from
the ones of the speech corpus (similar to LM1). We ob-
serve, however, a small improvement of the performance
with LM2 compared to LM1. We also analysed the outputs
of the ASR systems and found that many errors are due to
normalization issues in the text. Wolof is a morphologi-
cally complex language and some errors can appear at this
stage. In addition, as we said in 3.1., a same word can have
several surface forms, especially when it contains diacrit-
ics. For example, the word ”j´el” can also be written ”j¨el”
and mean ”took” or ”steal”. Also, the word ”randal” can be
written ”r`andal” and mean the same: ”keep away”, but can
also be spelled ”dandal”. About this problem of orthogra-
phy, the word ”c´eetal” for example can be spelled ”s´etal”
and means ”organise the wedding”. Concerning diacritics,
we also evaluate WER by removing all of them on both hy-
pothesis and references. The results are also provided in
table 5. WERs are slightly lower in that case and the dif-
ference between both numbers (WER with/w-o diacritics)
corresponds to diacritic errors. Moreover, we can observe
that DNNs bring some improvements on the dev set but not
on the test set in comparison with the SGMMs.

6. Conclusion

This paper presented the data collected and ASR systems
developped for 4 sub-saharan african languages (Swahili,
Hausa, Amharic and Wolof). All data and scripts are avail-
able online on our github8 repository. More precisely, we
focus on Wolof language by explaining our text and speech
collection methodology. We trained two language models:
one from some data we already owned and another one
with the addition of data crawled from the Web. Finally,
we present the ﬁrst ASR system ever built in this language.
The system which obtains the best score is the one using
the LM2 and the DNNs, for which we got 27.21% of WER.
Perspectives. In the short run, we intend to improve the
quality of the LM2 by using neural networks. We also
currently work on a duration model for the Wolof and the
Hausa ASR systems.
In the medium term, we want to deal with text normal-
ization. As we have seen, words can have several sur-
face forms and can be written in many ways. By selecting
one among a number of several possible variants, we want
to normalize the orthography of our corpus. We expect
that this desambigation will allow to reduce the number of
OOVs and improve the quality of our language model.
Last but not least, we continually develop and improve Lig-
Aikuma (Blachon et al., 2016), a fork of the Aikuma appli-
cation (Bird et al., 2014). Lig-Aikuma is destinated to ﬁeld
linguists and is designed to make the data collection work
easier and faster. Through the use of this application, we
will check, by an expert of the Wolof, our data collected
(right correspondence between the audio ﬁle and its tran-
scription) to assess our system on more reliable data.

Abstract
This article presents the data collected and ASR systems developped for 4 sub-saharan african languages (Swahili, Hausa, Amharic and
Wolof). To illustrate our methodology, the focus is made on Wolof (a very under-resourced language) for which we designed the ﬁrst
ASR system ever built in this language. All data and scripts are available online on our github repository.

Introduction

Today is very favorable to the development of a market for
speech in sub-saharan african languages. People’s access
to information and communications technologies (ICT) is
done mainly through mobile (and keyboard) and the need
for voice services can be found in all sectors, from higher
priority (health, food) to more fun (games, social media).
For this, overcoming the language barrier is needed. This
paper is done in the context of ALFFA project1 where two
main aspects are involved: fundamentals of speech anal-
ysis (language phonetic and linguistic description, dialec-
tology) and speech technologies (automatic speech recog-
nition (ASR) and text-to-speech (TTS)) for African lan-
guages. In the project, developed ASR and TTS technolo-
gies will be used to build micro speech services for mobile
phones in Africa. For this, speech fundamental knowledge
for targeted languages has to be upgraded while African
language technologies are still at their very beginning. For
these reasons, the ALFFA project is really interdisciplinary
since it does not only gather technology experts but also in-
cludes ﬁeldwork linguists/phoneticians.
Paper contribution. This article presents the data col-
lected and ASR systems developped for 4 sub-saharan
african languages (Swahili, Hausa, Amharic and Wolof).
To illustrate our methodology, the focus is made on Wolof
(a very under-resourced language) for which we designed
the ﬁrst ASR system ever built in this language.
Paper outline. The outline of this paper is the follow-
ing: ﬁrst, section 2 will summarize ASR sytems already
available on our github2 repository for Swahili, Hausa and
Amharic (together with scripts and resources needed to re-
produce ASR experiments). Then, sections 3, 4 and 5 will
focus respectively on text data collection, speech data col-
lection and ASR for Wolof language. Finally, section 6 will
conclude this work and give some perspectives.

2. ASR systems made available in the

ALFFA project
2.1. Target languages of the project
Language choice for the project is mainly governed by pop-
ulation coverage and industrial perspectives. We focus on
Hausa spoken by around 60 million people, as ﬁrst or sec-
ond language. Hausa is part of the family of Afroasiatic
languages. Speciﬁcally, Hausa is the most spoken language
among the Chadic languages (Vycichl, 1990). It is the ofﬁ-
cial language of northern Nigeria (around 30 million speak-
ers) and a national language of Niger (around 9 million
speakers) but is also spoken in Ghana, Benin, Cameroon,
Togo, Chad and Burkina Faso (Koslow, 1995). Hausa is
considered to be a common language of West Africa and
Central Africa: it is spoken in many large commercial cities
such as Dakar, Abidjan, Lome, Ouagadougou or Bamako.
Hausa is a tonal language. About a quarter of the Hausa
words comes from the Arabic language but Hausa was also
inﬂuenced by French. Hausa can be written with the Arabic
spelling since the beginning of the 17th century. This writ-
ing system is called ’Ajami. However, the ofﬁcial spelling
is based on the Latin alphabet called Boko. There are dif-
ferent varieties of Hausa, depending on whether it is spoken
in eastern (i.e: Kano, Zaria, Bauchi, Daura), western (i.e:
Sokoto, Gobir, Tahoua), northern (i.e: Katsina, Maradi,
Zinder) or southern (i.e: Zaria, Bauci) areas.
Enlarging the subregion coverage, we also consider Bam-
bara, Wolof, and Fula languages, to cover major West
African languages. All the languages targeted cover more
than half of the 300 million people of West Africa.
Bambara (or Bamanankan) is largely spoken in West Africa
by around 40 million people. It is mainly spoken in Mali
with 4 million speakers (census from the SIL3 in 2012) and
is used as a lingua franca. The Bambara is an agglutinative
language. It uses the Roman script written system and is a
tonal language.
Wolof belongs to the Atlantic languages which is part of the

3see https://www.ethnologue.com/

3863

Niger-Congo phylum. This language is spoken in Senegal,
Gambia and Mauritania where it is considered as a national
language. In addition, Wolof is considered as one of the
common languages and is spoken by 10 million people in
total. More details on the language are given in the section
3.1..
Fula is a set of dialects spoken in all West Africa coun-
tries by 70 million people. They include both tonal and
non-tonal languages. In the ALFFA project, we have de-
cided to focus on Pulaar, the western dialect of the fula lan-
guages. Like the Wolof, the Pulaar belongs to the Atlantic
languages which is part of the Niger-Congo phylum. The
dialect is mainly spoken in Senegal by almost 3.5 million
speakers (census in 2015 from the SIL) but also in dozens
of other African countries. The Pulaar dialect use the Latin-
based orthography.
As far as East Africa is concerned, we designed ASR sys-
tem for Swahili which is the most widespread language in
the East of the continent: spoken by more than 100 million
people4. Swahili (or Kiswahili) belongs to the Niger-Congo
phylum. It is the most spoken language among the Bantu
language: it is used as a ﬁrst language but also as a common
language by a large population. In Tanzania, the language
has an ofﬁcial status but Swahili is a national language in
numerous East and Central Africa. For centuries the Arabic
script has been used to written the Swahili but currently the
standard written system is based on Latin script.
We also work on Amharic, a Semitic language which is part
of the Afro-asiatic phylum. It is the second most spoken
language among the Semitic languages. It is spoken mostly
in Ethiopia by 22 million speakers (census from the SIL in
2010) where the language has an ofﬁcial status. Amharic
uses an alphasyllabary written system named ﬁdel :
the
consonant-vowel sequence represents a discrete unit (Com-
rie, 2009).

2.2. Automatic Speech Recognition for 3

languages

ASR systems for Swahili, Hausa and Amharic have been
built so far. All the data and scripts to build a complete
ASR system for these 3 languages are already available to
the public on the github repository already mentioned in
section 1. We used Kaldi speech recognition toolkit (Povey
et al., 2011) for building our ASR systems. For the Swahili
and Amharic ASR systems, the transcribed speech corpora,
pronunciation lexicons and language models (LMs) are also
made available while for Hausa ASR, users need to buy the
corpus and the lexicon at ELDA ﬁrst.
The ASR for Swahili was trained on about 10 hours of
speech and the evaluation was done on about 1.8 hours. The
language model was trained on text data grabbed from on-
line newspaper (about 28M words) and cleaned as much as
it could. More details on the Swahili corpus and how it was
collected can be found on (Gelas et al., 2010).
For Hausa, the GlobalPhone Speech Corpus (Schlippe et
al., 2012) was used. About 7 hours of data was used to
train the system and 1 hour to evaluate it. The language
model is composed of transcribed speech data from Glob-
alphone corpus (41k words) and was converted into lower

4see http://swahililanguage.stanford.edu

case. Finally, the lexicon contains 42,662 entries.
The Amharic system was retrained from the corpus de-
scribed in (Tachbelie et al., 2014) and represents about 20
hours of speech data, while the testing set represents about
2 hours. Concerning the language model, it was created
using SRILM using 3-grams and the text is segmented in
morphemes using Morfessor 2.0 (Creutz and Lagus, 2002).
A summary of the ASR performance (measured with Word
Error rate (WER)) obtained for the three languages is given
on table 1 but more experimental details can be found in the
README ﬁles of the Github repository.

3. Collecting text in Wolof

3.1. Our focus: Wolof language
As we said in 2.1., Wolof is mainly spoken in Senegal but
also in Gambia and Mauritania. Even if people who speaks
Wolof understand each other, the Senegalese Wolof and
the Gambian Wolof are two distincts languages: both own
their ISO 639-3 language code (respectively ”WOL” and
”WOF”). For our studies, we decided to focus on Sene-
galese Wolof, and more precisely on the urban Wolof spo-
ken in Dakar.
About 90% of the Senegalese people speak Wolof, while al-
most 40% of the population uses it as their mother tongue5.
Wolof is originally used as an oral language. The writing
system was developed at a later time, in Arabic orthogra-
phy named Wolofal ﬁrst (back to the pre-colonial period,
through Islam spreading) and then in Latin orthography
(through pre-colonial period). Nowadays, the latter is of-
ﬁcially in use. 29 Roman-based characters are used from
the Latin script and most of them are involved in digraphs
standing for geminate and prenasalized stops. Wolof is a
non-tonal language, with no diphthong and a moderate syl-
labic complexity.
The ofﬁcial language in Senegal is French. By deﬁnition,
it is the language used in all the Institutions of the gov-
ernment like administrations and all administrative papers,
courts, schools, etc. Consequently, Wolof is not learned at
school. The orthography has no real standard rules and can
be written in many ways. We will see later in this paper that
it causes some problems in ASR. Nonetheless, the Center
of Applied Linguistics of Dakar (CLAD)6, coordinates the
orthographic standardization of the Wolof language.
Finally, very few electronic documents are available for this
language. We started from a ﬁrst set of initial documents
gathered as part of (Nouguier Voisin, 2002) and then tried
to collect Wolof text from the Web.

Initial documents available

3.2.
First of all,
to build a textual corpus in
Wolof, we used some texts collected for the purpose of
(Nouguier Voisin, 2002). It gathers proverbs (Becker et al.,
2000), stories from (Kesteloot and Dieng, 1989), transcripts
of debates about healers, a song entitled ”Baay de Ouza”
and two dictionaries: ”Dictionnaire wolof-franc¸ais” writ-
ten by Aram Fal, Rosine Santos, Jean-L´eonce Doneux (Fal
et al., 1990) and ”Dictionnaire wolof-franc¸ais et franc¸ais-
wolof” by Jean L´eopold Diouf (Diouf, 2003). These ﬁles
were in different formats such as PDF, MS Word/Excel,
HTML, etc.
We extracted all these documents to TXT format. We post-
processed them by converting text into lower case and by
cleaning them from non-wolof data (like section number-
ing, numbered list, french notes, etc.) and punctuation.
Overall, it represents an overall usable text corpus of 20,162
utterances (147,801 words).

3.3. Retrieving data from the Web
148k words is small for statistical language modeling, so
we decided to collect more text data in Wolof using the
Web. Very few documents written in Wolof are actually
available. In addition, we looked for well-structured data
(in accordance with syntactic rules). For this purpose, we
found some PDF ﬁles from educational, religious and news
websites. We have extracted contents from the Univer-
sal Declaration of Human Rights, the Bible and a book
written by an humanist in TXT format.
In term of post-
processing, we removed symbols, punctuation characters
and non meaningful text (like section numbering, numbered
list, etc.) from the collected texts and converted characters
to lower case. In total, we got 197,430 additional words.
Also, given the limited data manually found, we decided
to crawl the Wikipedia database to collect a larger amount
of data in Wolof. We retrieved all the articles indexed in
the Wolof language using Wikipedia Extractor (Attardi and
Fuschetto, 2013). As this kind of open database is only
lightly supervised, some articles can be multilingual. To
remove non Wolof text, we applied the Google Compact
Language Detector (CLD2)7. As CLD2 cannot recognize
Wolof but can detect the most widely used languages, we
used the tool to ﬁlter out the non Wolof languages detected
(and hypothesized that the remaining documents were in
Wolof). To improve the precision on Wolof text retrieval,
we also applied a data selection tool called Xenc (Rousseau,
2013). After these two ﬁltering passes and quick man-
ual cleaning, we obtained an additional collection of about
311k words.
Table 2 summarizes the data ﬁnally retrieved from the Web.

4. Audio corpus in Wolof

From our initial
textual corpus (developed in section
3.2.), we randomly extracted a corpus of 6,000 utterances
with length between 6 and 12 words. Then, from this
small homogeneous corpus we extracted 18 sub-corpora
of 1,000 utterances that will be used as recording ses-
sions. We took advantage of the TTS recording campaign
in Dakar (Senegal) of our project partner Voxygen to col-
lect our read speech corpus. They recorded for us 18 na-
tives Wolof speakers (10 male, 8 female) from different
socio-professional categories (journalist, student, manager,
teacher, teleoperator) and from 24 to 48 years old, using
a Samson G-track microphone in a clean environment. A
sociolinguistic questionnaire was also collected for each
speaker.
The 18,000 recorded utterances represent 21h22mn of sig-
nal. We chose 14 speakers for the traning set, 2 for the
development set and 2 for the testing set. We checked that
each set was composed of an equivalent quantity of literary
genre.
Training / development / testing partition is given in table

5. First ASR system for Wolof
We built two language models. The ﬁrst 3-gram model
we trained with SRILM toolkit (Stolcke and others, 2002)
was trained on 106,206 words (11,065 unigrams). These
training data have been generated from the initial text cor-
pus (20,162 utterances represented by 147,801 words) from
which we removed utterances used for the speech record-
ings (41,595 words removed). The perplexity of the lan-
guage model is 294 on the dev set (7.1% of OOVs) and 301
on the test set (7.2% of OOVs). This model will be called
LM1 in the next sections. The second 3-gram language
model trained with SRILM toolkit is an interpolation be-
tween the ﬁrst one and another built from the data collected
on the Web (509k) cleaned, mentioned in 3.3..
It ﬁnally
corresponds to 601,609 words (29,148 unique words). Its
perplexity is 314 (5.4% of OOVs) on the dev set and 323
(5.1% of OOVs) on the test set. This model will be called
LM2 in the next sections. The table 4 summarizes the lan-
guage models built so far.

Regarding the pronunciation dictionary, we used a seed
of 8,724 entries corresponding to the concatenation of the

3865

the HMM/GMM system,

entries phonetically transcribed in (Fal et al., 1990) and
(Diouf, 2003). From this, we trained a 7-gram pronunci-
ation model for Wolof using Phonetisaurus (Novak, 2011),
a Grapheme-to-Phoneme (G2P) conversion system, which
allows us to automatically transcribe into phonetic sym-
bols the remaining vocabulary of the LMs not phonetized
yet. The vocabulary that covers LM1 language model is
made of 15,575 entries (including 302 variants) while the
one for LM2 has 32,039 entries. Each pronunciation dic-
tionary was used both for training and decoding stages.
We used Kaldi speech recognition toolkit for building our
ASR systems (and consequently, acoustic models). Three
systems based on different acoustic modeling techniques
were built: one based on the classical hidden Markov model
and Gaussian mixture model (HMM/GMM) approach, one
based on the subspace Gaussian mixture model (SGMM)
approach and another one using deep neural networks
(DNNs).
For
the acoustic models
were built using 13 Mel-frequency cepstrum coefﬁcients
(MFCCs) and Gaussian mixture models on 16.8h train-
ing data. We trained triphone models by employing 3,401
context-dependent states and 40k Gaussians. Besides that,
we implemented delta delta coefﬁcients on the MFCCs, lin-
ear discriminant analysis (LDA) transformation and max-
imum likelihood transform (MLLT) (Gopinath, 1998), as
well as speaker adaptation based on feature-space maxi-
mum likelihood linear regression (fMLLR) (Gales, 1998).
To build DNNs, we trained the network using state-level
minimum Bayes risk (Kingsbury, 2009) (sMBR) and the
network had seven layers, each of the six hidden layers had
1024 hidden units. The network was trained from 11 con-
secutive frames (5 preceding and 5 following frames) of
the same MFCCs as in the GMM systems. Furthermore,
same HMM states were used as targets of the DNN. The ini-
tial weights for the network were obtained using Restricted
Boltzmann Machines (RBMs) (Hinton, 2010) then ﬁne tun-
ing was done using Stochastic Gradient Descent.

We can see in the table 5 the performance for the ﬁrst Wolof
ASR system trained using HMM/GMM, SGMM and DNN
approaches. These baseline performances show that our
ﬁrst Wolof ASR system can reach WER around 30%. Since
we have only two speakers per evaluation set, the stan-
dard deviation is large. Indeed, we observed until 6% of
WER difference between speakers, on both dev and test
sets. Also, results are close between language models. Our
hypothesis is that LM2 does not provide much better per-

formances because it comes for the most part from the Web,
thus the vocabulary and syntax are much different from
the ones of the speech corpus (similar to LM1). We ob-
serve, however, a small improvement of the performance
with LM2 compared to LM1. We also analysed the outputs
of the ASR systems and found that many errors are due to
normalization issues in the text. Wolof is a morphologi-
cally complex language and some errors can appear at this
stage. In addition, as we said in 3.1., a same word can have
several surface forms, especially when it contains diacrit-
ics. For example, the word ”j´el” can also be written ”j¨el”
and mean ”took” or ”steal”. Also, the word ”randal” can be
written ”r`andal” and mean the same: ”keep away”, but can
also be spelled ”dandal”. About this problem of orthogra-
phy, the word ”c´eetal” for example can be spelled ”s´etal”
and means ”organise the wedding”. Concerning diacritics,
we also evaluate WER by removing all of them on both hy-
pothesis and references. The results are also provided in
table 5. WERs are slightly lower in that case and the dif-
ference between both numbers (WER with/w-o diacritics)
corresponds to diacritic errors. Moreover, we can observe
that DNNs bring some improvements on the dev set but not
on the test set in comparison with the SGMMs.

6. Conclusion

This paper presented the data collected and ASR systems
developped for 4 sub-saharan african languages (Swahili,
Hausa, Amharic and Wolof). All data and scripts are avail-
able online on our github8 repository. More precisely, we
focus on Wolof language by explaining our text and speech
collection methodology. We trained two language models:
one from some data we already owned and another one
with the addition of data crawled from the Web. Finally,
we present the ﬁrst ASR system ever built in this language.
The system which obtains the best score is the one using
the LM2 and the DNNs, for which we got 27.21% of WER.
Perspectives. In the short run, we intend to improve the
quality of the LM2 by using neural networks. We also
currently work on a duration model for the Wolof and the
Hausa ASR systems.
In the medium term, we want to deal with text normal-
ization. As we have seen, words can have several sur-
face forms and can be written in many ways. By selecting
one among a number of several possible variants, we want
to normalize the orthography of our corpus. We expect
that this desambigation will allow to reduce the number of
OOVs and improve the quality of our language model.
Last but not least, we continually develop and improve Lig-
Aikuma (Blachon et al., 2016), a fork of the Aikuma appli-
cation (Bird et al., 2014). Lig-Aikuma is destinated to ﬁeld
linguists and is designed to make the data collection work
easier and faster. Through the use of this application, we
will check, by an expert of the Wolof, our data collected
(right correspondence between the audio ﬁle and its tran-
scription) to assess our system on more reliable data.
