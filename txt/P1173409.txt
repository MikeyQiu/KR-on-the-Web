Abstract

Disentangling the content and style in the la-
tent space is prevalent in unpaired text style
transfer. However, two major issues exist in
most of the current neural models. 1) It is
difﬁcult to completely strip the style informa-
tion from the semantics for a sentence. 2)
The recurrent neural network (RNN) based en-
coder and decoder, mediated by the latent rep-
resentation, cannot well deal with the issue of
the long-term dependency, resulting in poor
preservation of non-stylistic semantic content.
In this paper, we propose the Style Trans-
former, which makes no assumption about the
latent representation of source sentence and
equips the power of attention mechanism in
Transformer to achieve better style transfer
and better content preservation. Source code
will be available on Github1.

Introduction

Text style transfer is the task of changing the
stylistic properties (e.g., sentiment) of the text
while retaining the style-independent content
within the context. Since the deﬁnition of the text
style is vague, it is difﬁcult to construct paired sen-
tences with the same content and differing styles.
Therefore, the studies of text style transfer focus
on the unpaired transfer.

Recently, neural networks have become the
dominant methods in text style transfer. Most
of the previous methods (Hu et al., 2017; Shen
et al., 2017; Fu et al., 2018; Carlson et al., 2017;
Zhang et al., 2018b,a; Prabhumoye et al., 2018;
Jin et al., 2019; Melnyk et al., 2017; dos Santos
et al., 2018) formulate the style transfer problem
into the “encoder-decoder” framework. The en-
coder maps the text into a style-independent latent

style-transformer

representation (vector representation), and the de-
coder generates a new text with the same content
but a different style from the disentangled latent
representation plus a style variable.

These methods focus on how to disentangle the
content and style in the latent space. The la-
tent representation needs better preserve the mean-
ing of the text while reducing its stylistic proper-
ties. Due to lacking paired sentence, an adversar-
ial loss (Goodfellow et al., 2014) is used in the
latent space to discourage encoding style informa-
tion in the latent representation. Although the dis-
entangled latent representation brings better inter-
pretability, in this paper, we address the following
concerns for these models.

1) It is difﬁcult to judge the quality of disen-
tanglement. As reported in (Elazar and Goldberg,
2018; Lample et al., 2019), the style information
can be still recovered from the latent represen-
tation even the model has trained adversarially.
Therefore, it is not easy to disentangle the stylistic
property from the semantics of a sentence.

2) Disentanglement is also unnecessary. Lam-
ple et al. (2019) reported that a good decoder can
generate the text with the desired style from an en-
tangled latent representation by “overwriting” the
original style.

3) Due to the limited capacity of vector repre-
sentation, the latent representation is hard to cap-
ture the rich semantic information, especially for
the long text. The recent progress of neural ma-
chine translation also proves that it is hard to re-
cover the target sentence from the latent represen-
tation without referring to the original sentence.

4) To disentangle the content and style infor-
mation in the latent space, all of the existing ap-
proaches have to assume the input sentence is en-
coded by a ﬁx-sized latent vector. As a result,
these approaches can not directly apply the atten-
tion mechanism to enhance the ability to preserve

the information in the input sentence.

5) Most of these models adopt recurrent neural
networks (RNNs) as encoder and decoder, which
has a weak ability to capture the long-range de-
pendencies between words in a sentence. Besides,
without referring the original text, RNN-based de-
coder is also hard to preserve the content. The gen-
eration quality for long text is also uncontrollable.
In this paper, we address the above concerns of
disentangled models for style transfer. Different
from them, we propose Style Transformer, which
takes Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017) as the ba-
sic block. Transformer is a fully-connected self-
attention neural architecture, which has achieved
many exciting results on natural language pro-
cessing (NLP) tasks, such as machine translation
(Vaswani et al., 2017), language modeling (Dai
et al., 2019),
text classiﬁcation (Devlin et al.,
2018). Different from RNNs, Transformer uses
stacked self-attention and point-wise, fully con-
nected layers for both the encoder and decoder.
Moreover, Transformer decoder fetches the infor-
mation from the encoder part via attention mech-
anism, compared to a ﬁxed size vector used by
RNNs. With the strong ability of Transformer, our
model can transfer the style of a sentence while
better preserving its meaning. The difference be-
tween our model and the previous model is shown
in Figure 1.

Our contributions are summarized as follows:

• We introduce a novel

training algorithm
which makes no assumptions about the dis-
entangled latent representations of the input
sentences, and thus the model can employ
attention mechanisms to improve its perfor-
mance further.

• To the best of our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst
work that applies the Transformer architec-
ture to style transfer task.

• Experimental results show that our proposed
approach generally outperforms the other
approaches on two style transfer datasets.
Speciﬁcally,
to the content preservation,
Style Transformer achieves the best perfor-
mance with a signiﬁcant improvement.

2 Related Work

Recently, many text style transfer approaches have
been proposed. Among these approaches, there
is a line of works aims to infer a latent repre-
sentation for the input sentence, and manipulate

the style of the generated sentence based on this
learned latent representation. Shen et al. (2017)
propose a cross-aligned auto-encoder with adver-
sarial training to learn a shared latent content dis-
tribution and a separated latent style distribution.
Hu et al. (2017) propose a new neural generative
model which combines variational auto-encoders
and holistic attribute discriminators for the effec-
tive imposition of semantic structures. Following
their work, many methods (Fu et al., 2018; John
et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2018a,b) has been pro-
posed based on standard encoder-decoder archi-
tecture.

Although, learning a latent representation will
make the model more interpretable and easy to
manipulate, the model which is assumed a ﬁxed
size latent representation cannot utilize the infor-
mation from the source sentence anymore.

On the other hand,

there are also some ap-
proaches without manipulating latent representa-
tion are proposed recently. Xu et al. (2018) pro-
pose a cycled reinforcement learning method for
unpaired sentiment-to-sentiment translation task.
Li et al. (2018) propose a three-stage method.
Their model ﬁrst extracts content words by delet-
ing phrases a strong attribute value, then retrieves
new phrases associated with the target attribute,
and ﬁnally uses a neural model to combine these
into a ﬁnal output. Lample et al. (2019) reduce text
style transfer to unsupervised machine translation
problem (Lample et al., 2018). They employ De-
noising Auto-encoders (Vincent et al., 2008) and
back-translation (Sennrich et al., 2016) to build a
translation style between different styles.

However, both lines of the previous models
make few attempts to utilize the attention mech-
anism to refer the long-term history or the source
sentence, except Lample et al. (2019).
In many
NLP tasks, especially for text generation, atten-
tion mechanism has been proved to be an essential
technique to enable the model to capture the long-
term dependency (Bahdanau et al., 2014; Luong
et al., 2015; Vaswani et al., 2017).

In this paper, we follow the second line of work
and propose a novel method which makes no as-
sumption about the latent representation of source
sentence and takes the proven self-attention net-
work, Transformer, as a basic module to train a
style transfer system.

3 Style Transformer

To make our discussion more clearly, in this sec-
tion, we will ﬁrst give a brief introduction to the
style transfer task, and then start to discuss our
proposed model based on our problem deﬁnition.

3.1 Problem Formalization

i=1, and each dataset Di

In this paper, we deﬁne the style transfer prob-
lem as follows: Considering a bunch of datasets
{Di}K
is composed of
many natural language sentences. For all of the
sentences in a single dataset Di , they share some
speciﬁc characteristic (e.g.
they are all the posi-
tive reviews for a speciﬁc product), and we refer
this shared characteristic as the style of these sen-
tences. In other words, a style is deﬁned by the
distribution of a dataset. Suppose we have K dif-
ferent datasets Di, then we can deﬁne K differ-
ent styles, and we denote each style by the symbol
s(i). The goal of style transfer is that: given a ar-
bitrary natural language sentence x and a desired
style (cid:98)s ∈ {s(i)}K
i=1, rewrite this sentence to a new
one (cid:98)x which has the style (cid:98)s and preserve the infor-
mation in original sentence x as much as possible.

Finally, we will combine the Style Transformer
network and discriminator network via an overall
learning algorithm in section 3.5 to train our style
transfer system.

3.3 Style Transformer Network

follows

Generally, Transformer
the standard
encoder-decoder architecture. Explicitly, for a in-
put sentence x = (x1, x2, ..., xn), the Transformer
encoder Enc(x; θE) maps inputs to a sequence
of continuous representations z = (z1, z2, ..., zn).
And the Transformer decoder Dec(z; θD) esti-
mates the conditional probability for the output
sentence y = (y1, y2, ..., yn) by auto-regressively
factorized its as:

pθ(y|x) =

pθ(yt|z, y1, ..., yt−1).

(1)

At each time step t, the probability of the next

token is computed by a softmax classiﬁer:

pθ(yt|z, y1, ..., yt−1) = softmax(ot),

(2)

where ot is logit vector outputted by decoder net-
work.

To enable style control in the standard Trans-
former framework, we add a extra style em-
bedding as input
to the Transformer encoder
Enc(x, s; θE). Therefore the network can com-
pute the probability of the output condition both
on the input sentence x and the style control vari-
able s. Formally, this can be expressed as:

pθ(y|x, s) =

pθ(yt|z, y1, ..., yt−1),

(3)

m
(cid:89)

t=1

and we denote the predicted output sentence of
this network by fθ(x, s).

3.2 Model Overview

3.4 Discriminator Network

To tackle the style transfer problem we deﬁned
above, our goal is to learn a mapping function
fθ(x, s) where x is a natural language sentence
and s is a style control variable. The output of
this function is the transferred sentence (cid:98)x for the
input sentence x.

A big challenge in the text style transfer is that
we have no access to the parallel corpora. Thus
we can’t directly obtain supervision to train our
In section 3.4, we employ two
transfer model.
discriminator-based approaches to create supervi-
sion from non-parallel corpora.

Suppose we use x and s to denote the sentence
and its style from the dataset D. Because of the
absence of the parallel corpora, we can’t directly
obtain the supervision for the case fθ(x, (cid:98)s) where
s (cid:54)= (cid:98)s. Therefore, we introduce a discriminator
network to learn this supervision from the non-
parallel copora.

The intuition behind the training of discrimina-
tor is based on the assumption below: As we men-
tioned above, we only have the supervision for the
case fθ(x, s).
In this case, because of the input
sentence x and chosen style s are both come from

the same dataset D, one of the optimum solutions,
in this case, is to reproduce the input sentence.
Thus, we can train our network to reconstruct the
input in this case. In the case of fθ(x, s) where
s (cid:54)= (cid:98)s, we construct supervision from two ways.
1) For the content preservation, we train the net-
work to reconstruct original input sentence x when
we feed transferred sentence (cid:98)y = fθ(x, (cid:98)s) to the
Style Transformer network with the original style
label s. 2) For the style controlling, we train a dis-
criminator network to assist the Style Transformer
network to better control the style of the generated
sentence.

In short, the discriminator network is another
Transformer encoder, which learns to distinguish
the style of different sentences. And the Style
Transformer network receives style supervision
from this discriminator. To achieve this goal, we
experiment with two different discriminator archi-
tectures.

Conditional Discriminator
In a setting similar
to Conditional GANs (Mirza and Osindero, 2014),
discriminator makes decision condition on a in-
put style. Explicitly, a sentence x and a proposal
style s are feed into discriminator dφ(x, s), and
the discriminator is asked to answer whether the
input sentence has the corresponding style. In dis-
criminator training stage, the real sentence from
datasets x, and the reconstructed sentence y =
fθ(x, s) are labeled as positive, and the transferred
sentences (cid:98)y = fθ(x, (cid:98)s) where s (cid:54)= (cid:98)s, are labeled
as negative. In Style Transformer network train-
ing stage, the network fθ is trained to maximize
the probability of positive when feed fθ(x, (cid:98)s) and
(cid:98)s to the discriminator.

Multi-class Discriminator Different from the
previous one, in this case, only one sentence is
feed into discriminator dφ(x), and the discrimi-
nator aims to answer the style of this sentence.
More concretely, the discriminator is a classiﬁer
with K + 1 classes. The ﬁrst K classes represent
K different styles, and the last class is stand for
the generated data from fθ(x, (cid:98)s) , which is also

often referred as fake sample.
training stage, we label the real sentences x and
reconstructed sentences y = fθ(x, s) to the label
of the corresponding style. And for the transferred
sentence (cid:98)y = fθ(x, (cid:98)s) where s (cid:54)= (cid:98)s, is labeled as
the class 0. In Style Transformer network learning
stage, we train the network fθ(x, (cid:98)s) to maximize

3.5 Learning Algorithm

In this section, we will discuss how to train these
two networks. And the training algorithm of our
model can be divided into two parts:
the dis-
criminator learning and Style Transformer net-
work learning. The brief illustration is shown in
Figure 2.

3.5.1 Discriminator Learning
in the discriminator training
Loosely speaking,
stage, we train our discriminator to distinguish be-
tween the real sentence x and reconstructed sen-
tence y = fθ(x, s) from the transferred sentence
(cid:98)y = fθ(x, (cid:98)s). The loss function for the discrimi-
nator is simply the cross-entropy loss of the clas-
siﬁcation problem.

For the conditional discriminator:

Ldiscriminator(φ) = −pφ(c|x, s).

(4)

And for the multi-class discriminator:

Ldiscriminator(φ) = −pφ(c|x).

(5)

According to the difference of discriminator ar-
chitecture, there is a different protocol for how to
label these sentences, and the details can be found
in Algorithm 1.

3.5.2 Style Transformer Learning

The training of Style Transformer is developed ac-
cording to the different cases of fθ(x, (cid:98)s) where
s = (cid:98)s or s (cid:54)= (cid:98)s.
Self Reconstruction For the case s = (cid:98)s , or
equivalently, the case fθ(x, s). As we discussed
before, the input sentence x and the input style s
comes from the same dataset , we can simply train
our Style Transformer to reconstruct the input sen-
tence by minimizing negative log-likelihood:

Lself (θ) = −pθ(y = x|x, s).

(6)

For the case s (cid:54)= (cid:98)s, we can’t obtain direct su-
pervision from our training set. So, we introduce
two different training loss to create supervision in-
directly.

Cycle Reconstruction To encourage generated
sentence preserving the information in the input
sentence x, we feed the generated sentence (cid:98)y =
fθ(x, (cid:98)s) to the Style Transformer with the style
of x and training our network to reconstruct orig-
inal input sentence by minimizing negative log-
likelihood:

Lcycle(θ) = −pθ(y = x|fθ(x, (cid:98)s), s).

(7)

Style Controlling If we only train our Style
Transformer to reconstruct the input sentence x
from transferred sentence (cid:98)y = fθ(x, (cid:98)s), the net-
work can only learn to copy the input to the out-
put. To handle this degeneration problem, we fur-
ther add a style controlling loss for the generated
sentence. Namely, the network generated sentence

(cid:98)y is feed into discriminator to maximize the prob-
ability of style (cid:98)s.

For the conditional discriminator,

the Style
Transformer aims to minimize the negative log-
likelihood of class 1 when feed to the discrimina-
tor with the style label (cid:98)s:

Lstyle(θ) = −pφ(c = 1|fθ(x, (cid:98)s), (cid:98)s).
And in the case of the multi-class discrimina-
tor, the Style Transformer is trained to minimize
the the negative log-likelihood of the correspond-
ing class of style (cid:98)s:

(8)

Lstyle(θ) = −pφ(c = (cid:98)s|fθ(x, (cid:98)s)).
Combining the loss function we discussed
above, the training procedure of the Style Trans-
former is summarized in Algorithm 2.

3.5.3 Summarization and Discussion
Finally, we can construct our ﬁnal training algo-
rithm based on discriminator learning and Style
Transformer learning steps. Similar to the train-
ing process of GANs (Goodfellow et al., 2014), in
each training iteration, we ﬁrst perform nd steps
discriminator learning to get a better discrimina-
tor, and then train our Style Transformer nf steps
to improve its performance. The training process
is summarized in Algorithm 3.

Before ﬁnishing this section, we ﬁnally discuss
a problem which we will be faced with in the train-
ing process. Because of the discrete nature of the
natural language, for the generated sentence (cid:98)y =
fθ(x, (cid:98)s), we can’t directly propagate gradients
from the discriminator through the discrete sam-
ples. To handle this problem, one can use REIN-
FORCE (Williams, 1992) or the Gumbel-Softmax
trick (Kusner and Hern´andez-Lobato, 2016) to es-
timates gradients from the discriminator. How-
ever, these two approaches are faced with high

variance problem, which will make the model hard
to converge. In our experiment, we also observed
that the Gumbel-Softmax trick would slow down
the model converging, and didn’t bring much per-
formance improvement to the model. For the rea-
sons above, empirically, we view the softmax dis-
tribution generated by fθ as a “soft” generated sen-
tence and feed this distribution to the downstream
network to keep the continuity of the whole train-
ing process. When this approximation is used, we
also switch our decoder network from greedy de-
coding to continuous decoding. Which is to say, at
every time step, instead of feed the token that has
maximum probability in previous prediction step
to the network, we feed the whole softmax distri-
bution (Eq. (2)) to the network. And the decoder
uses this distribution to compute a weighted av-
erage embedding from embedding matrix for the
input.

We evaluated and compared our approach with

the two datasets are shown in Table 1.

provided by the Yelp Dataset Challenge, consist-
ing of restaurants and business reviews with senti-
ment labels (negative or positive). Following pre-
vious work, we use the possessed dataset provided

IMDb Movie Review Dataset (IMDb) The IMDb
dataset2 consists of movie reviews written by on-
line users. To get a high quality dataset, we use
the highly polar movie reviews provided by Maas
et al.
(2011). Based on this dataset, we con-
struct a highly polar sentence-level style transfer
dataset by the following steps: 1) ﬁne tune a BERT
(Devlin et al., 2018) classiﬁer on original training
set, which achieves 95% accuracy on test set; 2)
split each review in the original dataset into sev-
eral sentences; 3) ﬁlter out sentences with conﬁ-
dence threshold below 0.9 by our ﬁne-tuned BERT
classiﬁer; 4) remove sentences with uncommon
words. Finally, this dataset contains 366K, 4k, 2k
sentences for training, validation, and testing, re-
spectively.

4.2 Evaluation

A goal transferred sentence should be a ﬂuent,
content-complete one with target style. To evalu-
ate the performance of the different model, follow-
ing previous works, we compared three different
dimensions of generated samples: 1) Style con-
trol, 2) Content preservation and 3) Fluency.

4.2.1 Automatic Evaluation

Style Control We measure style control automat-
ically by evaluating the target sentiment accuracy
of transferred sentences. For an accurate evalu-
ation of style control, we trained two sentiment
classiﬁers on the training set of Yelp and IMDb
using fastText (Joulin et al., 2017).
Content Preservation To measure content preser-
vation, we calculate the BLEU score (Papineni
et al., 2002) between the transferred sentence
and its source input using NLTK. A higher
BLEU score indicates the transferred sentence can
achieve better content preservation by retaining
more words from the source sentence. If a human
reference is available, we will calculate the BLEU

score between the transferred sentence and corre-
sponding reference as well. Two BLEU score met-
rics are referred to as self -BLEU and ref -BLEU
respectively.
Fluency Fluency is measured by the perplexity of
the transferred sentence, and we trained a 5-gram
language model on the training set of two datasets
using KenLM (Heaﬁeld, 2011).

4.2.2 Human Evaluation

Due to the lack of parallel data in style transfer
area, automatic metrics are insufﬁcient to evaluate
the quality of the transferred sentence. Therefore
we also conduct human evaluation experiments on
two datasets.

We randomly select 100 source sentences (50
for each sentiment) from each test set for human
evaluation. For each review, one source input and
three anonymous transferred samples are shown to
a reviewer. And the reviewer is asked to choose
the best sentence for style control, content preser-
vation, and ﬂuency respectively.

with four attention heads in each layer. The hidden
size, embedding size, and positional encoding size
in Transformer are all 256 dimensions. Another
embedding matrix with 256 hidden units is used
to represent different style, which is feed into en-
coder as an extra token of the input sentence. And
the positional encoding isn’t used for the style to-
ken. For the discriminator, similar to Radford et al.
(2018) and Devlin et al. (2018), we further add a
<cls> token to the input, and the output vector of
the corresponding position is feed into a softmax
classiﬁer which represents the output of discrimi-
nator.

In the experiment, we also found that preform-
ing random word dropout for the input sentence
when computing the self reconstruction loss (Eq.
(6)) can help model more easily to converge to a
reasonable performance. On the other hand, by
adding a temperature parameter to the softmax
layer (Eq. (2)) and using a sophisticated tempera-
ture decay schedule can also help the model to get
a better result in some case.

• Which sentence has the most opposite senti-

ment toward the source sentence?

4.4 Experimental Results

• Which sentence retains most content from the

source sentence?

• Which sentence is the most ﬂuent one?

To avoid interference from similar or same gener-
ated sentences, ”no preference.” is also an option
answer to these questions.

4.3 Training Details

In all of the experiment, for the encoder, decoder,
and discriminator, we all use 4-layer Transformer

Results using automatic metrics are presented in
Table 2. Comparing to previous approaches, our
models achieve competitive performance overall
and get better content preservation at all of two
datasets. Our conditional model can achieve a bet-
ter style controlling compared to the multi-class
model. Both our models are able to generate sen-
tences with relatively low perplexity. For those
previous models performing the best on a single
metric, an obvious drawback can always be found
on another metric.

For the human evaluation, we choose two

of the most well-performed models according to
the automatic evaluation results as competitors:
DeleteAndRetrieve (DAR) (Li et al., 2018) and
Controlled Generation (CtrlGen) (Hu et al., 2017).
And the generated outputs from multi-class dis-
criminator model is used as our ﬁnal model. We
have performed over 400 human evaluation re-
views. Results are presented in Table 3. The
human evaluation results are mainly conformed
with our automatic evaluation results. And it also
shows that our models are better in content preser-
vation, compared to two competitor model.

Finally, to better understand the characteristic of
different models, we sampled several output sen-
tences from the Yelp dataset, which are shown in
Table 4.

4.5 Ablation Study

To study the impact of different components on
overall performance, we further did an ablation
study for our model on Yelp dataset, and results
are reported in Table 5.

For better understanding the role of different
loss functions, we disable each loss function by
turns and retrain our model with the same setting
for the rest of hyperparameters. After we disable
self-reconstruction loss (Eq. (6)), our model failed
to learn a meaningful output and only learned
to generate a single word for any combination
of input sentence and style. However, when we
don’t use cycle reconstruction loss (Eq. (7)), it’s
also possible to train the model successfully, and
both of two models converge to reasonable perfor-
mance. And comparing to the full model, there
is a small improvement in style accuracy, but a
signiﬁcant drop in BLEU score. As our expected,
the cycle reconstruction loss is able to encourage
the model to preserve the information from the in-
put sentence. At last, when the discriminator loss
(Eq. (8) and (9)) is not used, the model quickly
degenerates to a model which is only copying the

input sentence to output without any style modi-
ﬁcation. This behaviour also conforms with our
intuition. If the model is only asked to minimize
the self-reconstruction loss and cycle reconstruc-
tion loss, directly copying input is one of the op-
timum solutions which is the easiest to achieve.
In summary, each of these loss plays an important
role in the Style Transformer training stage: 1) the
self-reconstruction loss guides the model to gen-
erate readable natural language sentence. 2) the
cycle reconstruction loss encourages the model to
preserve the information in the source sentence.
3) the discriminator provides style supervision to
help the model control the style of generated sen-
tences.

Another group of study is focused on the dif-
ferent type of samples used in the discriminator
training step. In Algorithm 1, we used a mixture
of real sentence x and generated sentence y as
the positive training samples for the discriminator.
By contrast, in the ablation study, we trained our
model with only one of them. As the result shows,
the generated sentence is the key component in
discriminator training. When we remove the real
sentence from the training data of discriminator,
our model can also achieve a competitive result
as the full model with only a small performance
drop. However, if we only use the real sentence
the model will lose a signiﬁcant part of the abil-
ity to control the style of the generated sentence,
and thus yields a bad performance in style accu-
racy. However, the model can still perform a style
control far better than the input copy model dis-
cussed in the previous part. For the reasons above,
we used a mixture of real sample and generated
sample in our ﬁnal version.

5 Conclusions and Future Work

In this paper, we proposed the Style Transformer
with a novel
training algorithm for text style
transfer task. Experimental results on two text
style transfer datasets have shown that our model
achieved a competitive or better performance com-
pared to previous state-of-the-art approaches. Es-
pecially, because our proposed approach doesn’t
assume a disentangled latent representation for
manipulating the sentence style, our model can get
better content preservation on both of two datasets.
In the future, we are planning to adapt our Style
Transformer to the multiple-attribute setting like
Lample et al. (2019). On the other hand, the back-
