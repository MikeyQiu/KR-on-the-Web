Abstract

Learning based methods have shown very promising results
for the task of depth estimation in single images. However,
most existing approaches treat depth prediction as a supervised
regression problem and as a result, require vast quantities
of corresponding ground truth depth data for training. Just
recording quality depth data in a range of environments is a
challenging problem. In this paper, we innovate beyond existing
approaches, replacing the use of explicit depth data during
training with easier-to-obtain binocular stereo footage.

We propose a novel training objective that enables our convo-
lutional neural network to learn to perform single image depth
estimation, despite the absence of ground truth depth data. Ex-
ploiting epipolar geometry constraints, we generate disparity
images by training our network with an image reconstruction
loss. We show that solving for image reconstruction alone re-
sults in poor quality depth images. To overcome this problem,
we propose a novel training loss that enforces consistency be-
tween the disparities produced relative to both the left and right
images, leading to improved performance and robustness com-
pared to existing approaches. Our method produces state of the
art results for monocular depth estimation on the KITTI driving
dataset, even outperforming supervised methods that have been
trained with ground truth depth.

1. Introduction

Depth estimation from images has a long history in computer
vision. Fruitful approaches have relied on structure from motion,
shape-from-X, binocular, and multi-view stereo. However, most
of these techniques rely on the assumption that multiple obser-
vations of the scene of interest are available. These can come
in the form of multiple viewpoints, or observations of the scene
under different lighting conditions. To overcome this limitation,
there has recently been a surge in the number of works that pose
the task of monocular depth estimation as a supervised learning
problem [32, 10, 36]. These methods attempt to directly predict
the depth of each pixel in an image using models that have been
trained offline on large collections of ground truth depth data.
While these methods have enjoyed great success, to date they

able to estimate depth for thin structures such as street signs and poles.

have been restricted to scenes where large image collections
and their corresponding pixel depths are available.

Understanding the shape of a scene from a single image,
independent of its appearance, is a fundamental problem in
machine perception. There are many applications such as
synthetic object insertion in computer graphics [29], synthetic
depth of field in computational photography [3], grasping
in robotics [34], using depth as a cue in human body pose
estimation [48], robot assisted surgery [49], and automatic 2D
to 3D conversion in film [53]. Accurate depth data from one
or more cameras is also crucial for self-driving cars, where
expensive laser-based systems are often used.

Humans perform well at monocular depth estimation by
exploiting cues such as perspective, scaling relative to the
known size of familiar objects, appearance in the form of
lighting and shading and occlusion [24]. This combination of
both top-down and bottom-up cues appears to link full scene
understanding with our ability to accurately estimate depth. In
this work, we take an alternative approach and treat automatic
depth estimation as an image reconstruction problem during
training. Our fully convolutional model does not require any
depth data, and is instead trained to synthesize depth as an
intermediate. It learns to predict the pixel-level correspondence
between pairs of rectified stereo images that have a known
camera baseline. There are some existing methods that also
address the same problem, but with several limitations. For
example they are not fully differentiable, making training
suboptimal [16], or have image formation models that do

not scale to large output resolutions [53]. We improve upon
these methods with a novel training objective and enhanced
network architecture that significantly increases the quality
of our final results. An example result from our algorithm is
illustrated in Fig. 1. Our method is fast and only takes on the
order of 35 milliseconds to predict a dense depth map for a
512
256 image on a modern GPU. Specifically, we propose
the following contributions:
1) A network architecture that performs end-to-end unsuper-
vised monocular depth estimation with a novel training loss that
enforces left-right depth consistency inside the network.
2) An evaluation of several training losses and image formation
models highlighting the effectiveness of our approach.
3) In addition to showing state of the art results on a challenging
driving dataset, we also show that our model generalizes to three
different datasets, including a new outdoor urban dataset that
we have collected ourselves, which we make openly available.

2. Related Work

There is a large body of work that focuses on depth
estimation from images, either using pairs [46], several
overlapping images captured from different viewpoints [14],
temporal sequences [44], or assuming a fixed camera, static
scene, and changing lighting [52, 2]. These approaches are
typically only applicable when there is more than one input
image available of the scene of interest. Here we focus on
works related to monocular depth estimation, where there is
only a single input image, and no assumptions about the scene
geometry or types of objects present are made.

Learning-Based Stereo

The vast majority of stereo estimation algorithms have a data
term which computes the similarity between each pixel in the
first image and every other pixel in the second image. Typically
the stereo pair is rectified and thus the problem of disparity (i.e.
scaled inverse depth) estimation can be posed as a 1D search
problem for each pixel. Recently, it has been shown that instead
of using hand defined similarity measures, treating the matching
as a supervised learning problem and training a function to
predict the correspondences produces far superior results
[54, 31]. It has also been shown that posing this binocular
correspondence search as a multi-class classification problem
has advantages both in terms of quality of results and speed
[38]. Instead of just learning the matching function, Mayer
et al. [39] introduced a fully convolutional [47] deep network
called DispNet that directly computes the correspondence
field between two images. At training time, they attempt to
directly predict the disparity for each pixel by minimizing a
regression training loss. DispNet has a similar architecture to
their previous end-to-end deep optical flow network [12].

The above methods rely on having large amounts of accurate
ground truth disparity data and stereo image pairs at training
time. This type of data can be difficult to obtain for real world

scenes, so these approaches typically use synthetic data for
training. Synthetic data is becoming more realistic, e.g. [15],
but still requires the manual creation of new content for every
new application scenario.

Supervised Single Image Depth Estimation

Single-view, or monocular, depth estimation refers to the
problem setup where only a single image is available at test
time. Saxena et al. [45] proposed a patch-based model known
as Make3D that first over-segments the input image into patches
and then estimates the 3D location and orientation of local
planes to explain each patch. The predictions of the plane
parameters are made using a linear model trained offline on
a dataset of laser scans, and the predictions are then combined
together using an MRF. The disadvantage of this method, and
other planar based approximations, e.g. [22], is that they can
have difficulty modeling thin structures and, as predictions
are made locally, lack the global context required to generate
realistic outputs. Instead of hand-tuning the unary and pairwise
terms, Liu et al. [36] use a convolutional neural network (CNN)
to learn them. In another local approach, Ladicky et al. [32]
incorporate semantics into their model to improve their per
pixel depth estimation. Karsch et al. [28] attempt to produce
more consistent image level predictions by copying whole depth
images from a training set. A drawback of this approach is that
it requires the entire training set to be available at test time.

Eigen et al. [10, 9] showed that it was possible to produce
dense pixel depth estimates using a two scale deep network
trained on images and their corresponding depth values. Unlike
most other previous work in single image depth estimation,
they do not rely on hand crafted features or an initial over-
segmentation and instead learn a representation directly from
the raw pixel values. Several works have built upon the success
of this approach using techniques such as CRFs to improve accu-
racy [35], changing the loss from regression to classification [5],
using other more robust loss functions [33], and incorporating
strong scene priors in the case of the related problem of surface
normal estimation [50]. Again, like the previous stereo methods,
these approaches rely on having high quality, pixel aligned,
ground truth depth at training time. We too perform single
depth image estimation, but train with an added binocular color
image, instead of requiring ground truth depth.

Unsupervised Depth Estimation

Recently, a small number of deep network based methods for
novel view synthesis and depth estimation have been proposed,
which do not require ground truth depth at training time. Flynn et
al. [13] introduced a novel image synthesis network called Deep-
Stereo that generates new views by selecting pixels from nearby
images. During training, the relative pose of multiple cameras
is used to predict the appearance of a held-out nearby image.
Then the most appropriate depths are selected to sample colors
from the neighboring images, based on plane sweep volumes.

At test time, image synthesis is performed on small overlapping
patches. As it requires several nearby posed images at test time
DeepStereo is not suitable for monocular depth estimation.

The Deep3D network of Xie et al. [53] also addresses the
problem of novel view synthesis, where their goal is to generate
the corresponding right view from an input left image (i.e. the
source image) in the context of binocular pairs. Again using an
image reconstruction loss, their method produces a distribution
over all the possible disparities for each pixel. The resulting
synthesized right image pixel values are a combination of the
pixels on the same scan line from the left image, weighted
by the probability of each disparity. The disadvantage of
their image formation model is that increasing the number
of candidate disparity values greatly increases the memory
consumption of the algorithm, making it difficult to scale their
approach to bigger output resolutions. In this work, we perform
a comparison to the Deep3D image formation model, and show
that our algorithm produces superior results.

Closest to our model in spirit is the concurrent work of
Garg et al. [16]. Like Deep3D and our method, they train
a network for monocular depth estimation using an image
reconstruction loss. However, their image formation model is
not fully differentiable. To compensate, they perform a Taylor
approximation to linearize their loss resulting in an objective
that is more challenging to optimize. Similar to other recent
work, e.g. [43, 56, 57], our model overcomes this problem by
using bilinear sampling [27] to generate images, resulting in
a fully (sub-)differentiable training loss.

We propose a fully convolutional deep neural network
loosely inspired by the supervised DispNet architecture of
Mayer et al. [39]. By posing monocular depth estimation
as an image reconstruction problem, we can solve for the
disparity field without requiring ground truth depth. However,
only minimizing a photometric loss can result in good quality
image reconstructions but poor quality depth. Among other
terms, our fully differentiable training loss includes a left-right
consistency check to improve the quality of our synthesized
depth images. This type of consistency check is commonly
used as a post-processing step in many stereo methods, e.g.
[54], but we incorporate it directly into our network.

3. Method

This section describes our single image depth prediction
network. We introduce a novel depth estimation training loss,
featuring an inbuilt left-right consistency check, which enables
us to train on image pairs without requiring supervision in the
form of ground truth depth.

3.1. Depth Estimation as Image Reconstruction

Given a single image I at test time, our goal is to learn a
function f that can predict the per-pixel scene depth, ˆd=f(I).
Most existing learning based approaches treat this as a
supervised learning problem, where they have color input

Figure 2. Our loss module outputs left and right disparity maps, dl
and dr. The loss combines smoothness, reconstruction, and left-right
disparity consistency terms. This same module is repeated at each of
the four different output scales. C: Convolution, UC: Up-Convolution,

images and their corresponding target depth values at training. It
is presently not practical to acquire such ground truth depth data
for a large variety of scenes. Even expensive hardware, such
as laser scanners, can be imprecise in natural scenes featuring
movement and reflections. As an alternative, we instead pose
depth estimation as an image reconstruction problem during
training. The intuition here is that, given a calibrated pair of
binocular cameras, if we can learn a function that is able to
reconstruct one image from the other, then we have learned
something about the 3D shape of the scene that is being imaged.
Specifically, at training time, we have access to two images
Il and Ir, corresponding to the left and right color images from
a calibrated stereo pair, captured at the same moment in time.
Instead of trying to directly predict the depth, we attempt to
find the dense correspondence field dr that, when applied to the
left image, would enable us to reconstruct the right image. We
will refer to the reconstructed image Il(dr) as ˜Ir. Similarly, we
can also estimate the left image given the right one, ˜Il =Ir(dl).
Assuming that the images are rectified [19], d corresponds to
the image disparity - a scalar value per pixel that our model
will learn to predict. Given the baseline distance b between the
cameras and the camera focal length f, we can then trivially
recover the depth ˆd from the predicted disparity, ˆd=bf/d.

3.2. Depth Estimation Network

At a high level, our network estimates depth by inferring
the disparities that warp the left image to match the right one.
The key insight of our method is that we can simultaneously
infer both disparities (left-to-right and right-to-left), using only
the left input image, and obtain better depths by enforcing them
to be consistent with each other.

Our network generates the predicted image with backward
mapping using a bilinear sampler, resulting in a fully differen-
tiable image formation model. As illustrated in Fig. 3, na¨ıvely
learning to generate the right image by sampling from the left

smooth disparities, and Clr prefers the predicted left and right
disparities to be consistent. Each of the main terms contains
both a left and a right image variant, but only the left image
is fed through the convolutional layers.

Next, we present each component of our loss in terms of the

ap). The right image versions, e.g. Cr

Appearance Matching Loss During training, the network
learns to generate an image by sampling pixels from the
opposite stereo image. Our image formation model uses the
image sampler from the spatial transformer network (STN) [27]
to sample the input image using a disparity map. The STN uses
bilinear sampling where the output pixel is the weighted sum of
four input pixels. In contrast to alternative approaches [16, 53],
the bilinear sampler used is locally fully differentiable and
integrates seamlessly into our fully convolutional architecture.
This means that we do not require any simplification or
approximation of our cost function.

Inspired by [55], we use a combination of an L1 and
single scale SSIM [51] term as our photometric image
reconstruction cost Cap, which compares the input image Il

Disparity Smoothness Loss We encourage disparities to be

Left-Right Disparity Consistency Loss To produce more
accurate disparity maps, we train our network to predict both
the left and right image disparities, while only being given
the left view as input to the convolutional part of the network.
To ensure coherence, we introduce an L1 left-right disparity
consistency penalty as part of our model. This cost attempts
to make the left-view disparity map be equal to the projected

one will produce disparities aligned with the right image (target).
However, we want the output disparity map to align with the
input left image, meaning the network has to sample from the
right image. We could instead train the network to generate the
left view by sampling from the right image, thus creating a left
view aligned disparity map (No LR in Fig. 3). While this alone
works, the inferred disparities exhibit ‘texture-copy’ artifacts and
errors at depth discontinuities as seen in Fig. 5. We solve this by
training the network to predict the disparity maps for both views
by sampling from the opposite input images. This still only
requires a single left image as input to the convolutional layers
and the right image is only used during training (Ours in Fig. 3).
Enforcing consistency between both disparity maps using this
novel left-right consistency cost leads to more accurate results.
Our fully convolutional architecture is inspired by Disp-
Net [39], but features several important modifications that
enable us to train without requiring ground truth depth. Our net-
work, is composed of two main parts - an encoder (from cnv1 to
cnv7b) and decoder (from upcnv7), please see the supplementary
material for a detailed description. The decoder uses skip con-
nections [47] from the encoder’s activation blocks, enabling it to
resolve higher resolution details. We output disparity predictions
at four different scales (disp4 to disp1), which double in spatial
resolution at each of the subsequent scales. Even though it only
takes a single image as input, our network predicts two disparity
maps at each output scale - left-to-right and right-to-left.

Table 1. Comparison of different image formation models. Results on the KITTI 2015 stereo 200 training set disparity images [17]. For training,
K is the KITTI dataset [17] and CS is Cityscapes [8]. Our model with left-right consistency performs the best, and is further improved with the
addition of the Cityscapes data. The last row shows the result of our model trained and tested with two input images instead of one (see Sec. 4.3).

At test time, our network predicts the disparity at the finest
scale level for the left image dl, which has the same resolution
as the input image. Using the known camera baseline and focal
length from the training set, we then convert from the disparity
map to a depth map. While we also estimate the right disparity
dr during training, it is not used at test time.

4. Results

Here we compare the performance of our approach to both
supervised and unsupervised single view depth estimation
methods. We train on rectified stereo image pairs, and do
not require any supervision in the form of ground truth depth.
Existing single image datasets, such as [41, 45], that lack
stereo pairs, are not suitable for evaluation. Instead we evaluate
our approach using the popular KITTI 2015 [17] dataset. To
evaluate our image formation model, we compare to a variant
of our algorithm that uses the original Deep3D [53] image
formation model and a modified one, Deep3Ds, with an added
smoothness constraint. We also evaluate our approach with and
without the left-right consistency constraint.

4.1. Implementation Details

×

The network which is implemented in TensorFlow [1] con-
tains 31 million trainable parameters, and takes on the order of
25 hours to train using a single Titan X GPU on a dataset of 30
thousand images for 50 epochs. Inference is fast and takes less
than 35 ms, or more than 28 frames per second, for a 512
256
image, including transfer times to and from the GPU. Please
see the supplementary material and our code1 for more details.
During optimization, we set the weighting of the different
loss components to αap = 1 and αlr = 1. The possible output
disparities are constrained to be between 0 and dmax using a
scaled sigmoid non-linearity, where dmax = 0.3

width at a given output scale. As a result of our multi-scale
output, the typical disparity of neighboring pixels will differ
by a factor of two between each scale (as we are upsampling
the output by a factor of two). To correct for this, we scale the
disparity smoothness term αds with r for each scale to get equiv-
alent smoothing at each level. Thus αds =0.1/r, where r is the

downscaling factor of the corresponding layer with respect to
the resolution of the input image that is passed into the network.
For the non-linearities in the network, we used exponential
linear units [7] instead of the commonly used rectified liner units
(ReLU) [40]. We found that ReLUs tended to prematurely fix
the predicted disparities at intermediate scales to a single value,
making subsequent improvement difficult. Following [42],
we replaced the usual deconvolutions with a nearest neighbor
upsampling followed by a convolutions. We trained our model
from scratch for 50 epochs, with a batch size of 8 using Adam
8. We used an
[30], where β1 = 0.9, β2 = 0.999, and (cid:15) = 10−
4 which we kept constant for the
initial learning rate of λ=10−
first 30 epochs before halving it every 10 epochs until the end.
We initially experimented with progressive update schedules,
as in [39], where lower resolution image scales were optimized
first. However, we found that optimizing all four scales at once
led to more stable convergence. Similarly, we use an identical
weighting for the loss of each scale as we found that weighting
them differently led to unstable convergence. We experimented
with batch normalization [26], but found that it did not produce
a significant improvement, and ultimately excluded it.

Data augmentation is performed on the fly. We flip the input
images horizontally with a 50% chance, taking care to also
swap both images so they are in the correct position relative
to each other. We also added color augmentations, with a
50% chance, where we performed random gamma, brightness,
and color shifts by sampling from uniform distributions in
the ranges [0.8,1.2] for gamma, [0.5,2.0] for brightness, and
[0.8,1.2] for each color channel separately.

Resnet50 For the sake of completeness, and similar to [33],
we also show a variant of our model using Resnet50 [20] as
the encoder, the rest of the architecture, parameters and training
procedure staying identical. This variant contains 48 million
trainable parameters and is indicated by resnet in result tables.

Post-processing In order to reduce the effect of stereo disoc-
clusions which create disparity ramps on both the left side of the
image and of the occluders, a final post-processing step is per-
formed on the output. For an input image I at test time, we also

compute the disparity map d(cid:48)l for its horizontally flipped image
I(cid:48). By flipping back this disparity map we obtain a disparity
map d(cid:48)(cid:48)l , which aligns with dl but where the disparity ramps are
located on the right of occluders as well as on the right side of the
image. We combine both disparity maps to form the final result
by assigning the first 5% on the left of the image using d(cid:48)(cid:48)l and
the last 5% on the right to the disparities from dl. The central
part of the final disparity map is the average of dl and d(cid:48)l. This
final post-processing step leads to both better accuracy and less
visual artifacts at the expense of doubling the amount of test time
computation. We indicate such results using pp in result tables.

4.2. KITTI

We present results for the KITTI dataset [17] using two
different test splits, to enable comparison to existing works. In its
raw form, the dataset contains 42,382 rectified stereo pairs from
375 pixels in size.
61 scenes, with a typical image being 1242

×

KITTI Split First we compare different variants of our
method including different image formation models and differ-
ent training sets. We evaluate on the 200 high quality disparity
images provided as part of the official KITTI training set, which
covers a total of 28 scenes. The remaining 33 scenes contain
30,159 images from which we keep 29,000 for training and the
rest for evaluation. While these disparity images are much better
quality than the reprojected velodyne laser depth values, they
have CAD models inserted in place of moving cars. These CAD
models result in ambiguous disparity values on transparent
surfaces such as car windows, and issues at object boundaries
where the CAD models do not perfectly align with the images.
In addition, the maximum depth present in the KITTI dataset is
on the order of 80 meters, and we cap the maximum predictions
of all networks to this value. Results are computed using the
depth metrics from [10] along with the D1-all disparity error
from KITTI [17]. The metrics from [10] measure error in both
meters from the ground truth and the percentage of depths that
are within some threshold from the correct value. It is important
to note that measuring the error in depth space while the ground
truth is given in disparities leads to precision issues. In particular,
the non-thresholded measures can be sensitive to the large errors
in depth caused by prediction errors at small disparity values.

In Table 1, we see that in addition to having poor scaling prop-

erties (in terms of both resolution and the number of disparities it
can represent), when trained from scratch with the same network
architecture as ours, the Deep3D [53] image formation model
performs poorly. From Fig. 6 we can see that Deep3D produces
plausible image reconstructions but the output disparities are in-
ferior to ours. Our loss outperforms both the Deep3D baselines
and the addition of the left-right consistency check increases per-
formance in all measures. In Fig. 5 we illustrate some zoomed
in comparisons, clearly showing that the inclusion of the left-
right check improves the visual quality of the results. Our results
are further improved by first pre-training our model with addi-
tional training data from the Cityscapes dataset [8] containing
22,973 training stereo pairs captured in various cities across Ger-
many. This dataset brings higher resolution, image quality, and
variety compared to KITTI, while having a similar setting. We
cropped the input images to only keep the top 80% of the image,
removing the very reflective car hoods from the input. Interest-
ingly, our model trained on Cityscapes alone does not perform
very well numerically. This is likely due to the difference in
camera calibration between the two datasets, but there is a clear
advantage to fine-tuning on data that is related to the test set.

Eigen Split To be able to compare to existing work, we also
use the test split of 697 images as proposed by [10] which
covers a total of 29 scenes. The remaining 32 scenes contain
23,488 images from which we keep 22,600 for training and the
rest for evaluation, similarly to [16]. To generate the ground
truth depth images, we reproject the 3D points viewed from the
velodyne laser into the left input color camera. Aside from only
producing depth values for less than 5% of the pixels in the
input image, errors are also introduced because of the rotation

predictions of Liu et al. [36]* are generated on a mix of the left and right images instead of just the left input images. For a fair comparison, we
compute their results relative to the correct image. As in the provided source code, Eigen et al. [10]◦ results are computed relative to the velodyne
instead of the camera. Garg et al. [16] results are taken directly from their paper. All results, except [10], use the crop from [16]. We also show
our results with the same crop and maximum evaluation distance. The last two rows are computed on the uncropped ground truth.

of the Velodyne, the motion of the vehicle and surrounding
objects, and also incorrect depth readings due to occlusion at
object boundaries. To be fair to all methods, we use the same
crop as [10] and evaluate at the input image resolution. With the
exception of Garg et al.’s [16] results, the results of the baseline
methods are recomputed by us given the authors’s original
predictions to ensure that all the scores are directly comparable.
This produces slightly different numbers than the previously
published ones, e.g. in the case of [10], their predictions were
evaluated on much smaller depth images (1/4 the original size).
For all baseline methods we use bilinear interpolation to resize
the predictions to the correct input image size.

Table 2 shows quantitative results with some example
outputs shown in Fig. 4. We see that our algorithm outperforms
all other existing methods, including those that are trained with
ground truth depth data. We again see that pre-training on the
Cityscapes dataset improves the results over using KITTI alone.

4.3. Stereo

We also implemented a stereo version of our model, see
Fig. 8, where the network’s input is the concatenation of both
left and right views. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the stereo models
outperforms our monocular network on every single metric,
especially on the D1-all disparity measure, as can be seen
in Table 1. This model was only trained for 12 epochs as it
becomes unstable if trained for longer.

4.4. Make3D

To illustrate that our method can generalize to other datasets,
here we compare to several fully supervised methods on the
Make3D test set of [45]. Make3D consists of only RGB/Depth
pairs and no stereo images, thus our method cannot train on this
data. We use our network trained only on the Cityscapes dataset
and despite the dissimilarities in the datasets, both in content
and camera parameters, we still achieve reasonable results,
even beating [28] on one metric and [37] on three. Due to the
different aspect ratio of the Make3D dataset we evaluate on a
central crop of the images. In Table 3, we compare our output to
the similarly cropped results of the other methods. As in the case
of the KITTI dataset, these results would likely be improved
with more relevant training data. A qualitative comparison to
some of the related methods is shown in Fig. 7. While our
numerical results are not as good as the baselines, qualitatively,
we compare favorably to the supervised competition.

4.5. Generalizing to Other Datasets

Finally, we illustrate some further examples of our model
generalizing to other datasets in Figure 9. Using the model only
trained on Cityscapes [8], we tested on the CamVid driving
dataset [4]. In the accompanying video and the supplementary
material we can see that despite the differences in location,
image characteristics, and camera calibration, our model still

4.6. Limitations

Even though both our left-right consistency check and post-
processing improve the quality of the results, there are still some
artifacts visible at occlusion boundaries due to the pixels in the
occlusion region not being visible in both images. Explicitly rea-
soning about occlusion during training [23, 25] could improve
these issues. It is worth noting that depending how large the base-
line between the camera and the depth sensor, fully supervised
approaches also do not always have valid depth for all pixels.

Our method requires rectified and temporally aligned
stereo pairs during training, which means that it is currently
not possible to use existing single-view datasets for training
purposes e.g. [41]. However, it is possible to fine-tune our
model on application specific ground truth depth data.

Finally, our method mainly relies on the image reconstruc-
tion term, meaning that specular [18] and transparent surfaces
will produce inconsistent depths. This could be improved with
more sophisticated similarity measures [54].

5. Conclusion

We have presented an unsupervised deep neural network for
single image depth estimation. Instead of using aligned ground
truth depth data, which is both rare and costly, we exploit the
ease with which binocular stereo data can be captured. Our
novel loss function enforces consistency between the predicted
depth maps from each camera view during training, improving
predictions. Our results are superior to fully supervised
baselines, which is encouraging for future research that does
not require expensive to capture ground truth depth. We have
also shown that our model can generalize to unseen datasets
and still produce visually plausible depth maps.

In future work, we would like to extend our model to
videos. While our current depth estimates are performed
independently per frame, adding temporal consistency [28]
would likely improve results. It would also be interesting to
investigate sparse input as an alternative training signal [58, 6].
Finally, while our model estimates per pixel depth, it would be
interesting to also predict the full occupancy of the scene [11].

Abstract

Learning based methods have shown very promising results
for the task of depth estimation in single images. However,
most existing approaches treat depth prediction as a supervised
regression problem and as a result, require vast quantities
of corresponding ground truth depth data for training. Just
recording quality depth data in a range of environments is a
challenging problem. In this paper, we innovate beyond existing
approaches, replacing the use of explicit depth data during
training with easier-to-obtain binocular stereo footage.

We propose a novel training objective that enables our convo-
lutional neural network to learn to perform single image depth
estimation, despite the absence of ground truth depth data. Ex-
ploiting epipolar geometry constraints, we generate disparity
images by training our network with an image reconstruction
loss. We show that solving for image reconstruction alone re-
sults in poor quality depth images. To overcome this problem,
we propose a novel training loss that enforces consistency be-
tween the disparities produced relative to both the left and right
images, leading to improved performance and robustness com-
pared to existing approaches. Our method produces state of the
art results for monocular depth estimation on the KITTI driving
dataset, even outperforming supervised methods that have been
trained with ground truth depth.

1. Introduction

Depth estimation from images has a long history in computer
vision. Fruitful approaches have relied on structure from motion,
shape-from-X, binocular, and multi-view stereo. However, most
of these techniques rely on the assumption that multiple obser-
vations of the scene of interest are available. These can come
in the form of multiple viewpoints, or observations of the scene
under different lighting conditions. To overcome this limitation,
there has recently been a surge in the number of works that pose
the task of monocular depth estimation as a supervised learning
problem [32, 10, 36]. These methods attempt to directly predict
the depth of each pixel in an image using models that have been
trained offline on large collections of ground truth depth data.
While these methods have enjoyed great success, to date they

have been restricted to scenes where large image collections
and their corresponding pixel depths are available.

Understanding the shape of a scene from a single image,
independent of its appearance, is a fundamental problem in
machine perception. There are many applications such as
synthetic object insertion in computer graphics [29], synthetic
depth of field in computational photography [3], grasping
in robotics [34], using depth as a cue in human body pose
estimation [48], robot assisted surgery [49], and automatic 2D
to 3D conversion in film [53]. Accurate depth data from one
or more cameras is also crucial for self-driving cars, where
expensive laser-based systems are often used.

Humans perform well at monocular depth estimation by
exploiting cues such as perspective, scaling relative to the
known size of familiar objects, appearance in the form of
lighting and shading and occlusion [24]. This combination of
both top-down and bottom-up cues appears to link full scene
understanding with our ability to accurately estimate depth. In
this work, we take an alternative approach and treat automatic
depth estimation as an image reconstruction problem during
training. Our fully convolutional model does not require any
depth data, and is instead trained to synthesize depth as an
intermediate. It learns to predict the pixel-level correspondence
between pairs of rectified stereo images that have a known
camera baseline. There are some existing methods that also
address the same problem, but with several limitations. For
example they are not fully differentiable, making training
suboptimal [16], or have image formation models that do

not scale to large output resolutions [53]. We improve upon
these methods with a novel training objective and enhanced
network architecture that significantly increases the quality
of our final results. An example result from our algorithm is
illustrated in Fig. 1. Our method is fast and only takes on the
order of 35 milliseconds to predict a dense depth map for a
512
256 image on a modern GPU. Specifically, we propose
the following contributions:
1) A network architecture that performs end-to-end unsuper-
vised monocular depth estimation with a novel training loss that
enforces left-right depth consistency inside the network.
2) An evaluation of several training losses and image formation
models highlighting the effectiveness of our approach.
3) In addition to showing state of the art results on a challenging
driving dataset, we also show that our model generalizes to three
different datasets, including a new outdoor urban dataset that
we have collected ourselves, which we make openly available.

2. Related Work

There is a large body of work that focuses on depth
estimation from images, either using pairs [46], several
overlapping images captured from different viewpoints [14],
temporal sequences [44], or assuming a fixed camera, static
scene, and changing lighting [52, 2]. These approaches are
typically only applicable when there is more than one input
image available of the scene of interest. Here we focus on
works related to monocular depth estimation, where there is
only a single input image, and no assumptions about the scene
geometry or types of objects present are made.

Learning-Based Stereo

The vast majority of stereo estimation algorithms have a data
term which computes the similarity between each pixel in the
first image and every other pixel in the second image. Typically
the stereo pair is rectified and thus the problem of disparity (i.e.
scaled inverse depth) estimation can be posed as a 1D search
problem for each pixel. Recently, it has been shown that instead
of using hand defined similarity measures, treating the matching
as a supervised learning problem and training a function to
predict the correspondences produces far superior results
[54, 31]. It has also been shown that posing this binocular
correspondence search as a multi-class classification problem
has advantages both in terms of quality of results and speed
[38]. Instead of just learning the matching function, Mayer
et al. [39] introduced a fully convolutional [47] deep network
called DispNet that directly computes the correspondence
field between two images. At training time, they attempt to
directly predict the disparity for each pixel by minimizing a
regression training loss. DispNet has a similar architecture to
their previous end-to-end deep optical flow network [12].

The above methods rely on having large amounts of accurate
ground truth disparity data and stereo image pairs at training
time. This type of data can be difficult to obtain for real world

scenes, so these approaches typically use synthetic data for
training. Synthetic data is becoming more realistic, e.g. [15],
but still requires the manual creation of new content for every
new application scenario.

Supervised Single Image Depth Estimation

Single-view, or monocular, depth estimation refers to the
problem setup where only a single image is available at test
time. Saxena et al. [45] proposed a patch-based model known
as Make3D that first over-segments the input image into patches
and then estimates the 3D location and orientation of local
planes to explain each patch. The predictions of the plane
parameters are made using a linear model trained offline on
a dataset of laser scans, and the predictions are then combined
together using an MRF. The disadvantage of this method, and
other planar based approximations, e.g. [22], is that they can
have difficulty modeling thin structures and, as predictions
are made locally, lack the global context required to generate
realistic outputs. Instead of hand-tuning the unary and pairwise
terms, Liu et al. [36] use a convolutional neural network (CNN)
to learn them. In another local approach, Ladicky et al. [32]
incorporate semantics into their model to improve their per
pixel depth estimation. Karsch et al. [28] attempt to produce
more consistent image level predictions by copying whole depth
images from a training set. A drawback of this approach is that
it requires the entire training set to be available at test time.

Eigen et al. [10, 9] showed that it was possible to produce
dense pixel depth estimates using a two scale deep network
trained on images and their corresponding depth values. Unlike
most other previous work in single image depth estimation,
they do not rely on hand crafted features or an initial over-
segmentation and instead learn a representation directly from
the raw pixel values. Several works have built upon the success
of this approach using techniques such as CRFs to improve accu-
racy [35], changing the loss from regression to classification [5],
using other more robust loss functions [33], and incorporating
strong scene priors in the case of the related problem of surface
normal estimation [50]. Again, like the previous stereo methods,
these approaches rely on having high quality, pixel aligned,
ground truth depth at training time. We too perform single
depth image estimation, but train with an added binocular color
image, instead of requiring ground truth depth.

Unsupervised Depth Estimation

Recently, a small number of deep network based methods for
novel view synthesis and depth estimation have been proposed,
which do not require ground truth depth at training time. Flynn et
al. [13] introduced a novel image synthesis network called Deep-
Stereo that generates new views by selecting pixels from nearby
images. During training, the relative pose of multiple cameras
is used to predict the appearance of a held-out nearby image.
Then the most appropriate depths are selected to sample colors
from the neighboring images, based on plane sweep volumes.

At test time, image synthesis is performed on small overlapping
patches. As it requires several nearby posed images at test time
DeepStereo is not suitable for monocular depth estimation.

The Deep3D network of Xie et al. [53] also addresses the
problem of novel view synthesis, where their goal is to generate
the corresponding right view from an input left image (i.e. the
source image) in the context of binocular pairs. Again using an
image reconstruction loss, their method produces a distribution
over all the possible disparities for each pixel. The resulting
synthesized right image pixel values are a combination of the
pixels on the same scan line from the left image, weighted
by the probability of each disparity. The disadvantage of
their image formation model is that increasing the number
of candidate disparity values greatly increases the memory
consumption of the algorithm, making it difficult to scale their
approach to bigger output resolutions. In this work, we perform
a comparison to the Deep3D image formation model, and show
that our algorithm produces superior results.

Closest to our model in spirit is the concurrent work of
Garg et al. [16]. Like Deep3D and our method, they train
a network for monocular depth estimation using an image
reconstruction loss. However, their image formation model is
not fully differentiable. To compensate, they perform a Taylor
approximation to linearize their loss resulting in an objective
that is more challenging to optimize. Similar to other recent
work, e.g. [43, 56, 57], our model overcomes this problem by
using bilinear sampling [27] to generate images, resulting in
a fully (sub-)differentiable training loss.

We propose a fully convolutional deep neural network
loosely inspired by the supervised DispNet architecture of
Mayer et al. [39]. By posing monocular depth estimation
as an image reconstruction problem, we can solve for the
disparity field without requiring ground truth depth. However,
only minimizing a photometric loss can result in good quality
image reconstructions but poor quality depth. Among other
terms, our fully differentiable training loss includes a left-right
consistency check to improve the quality of our synthesized
depth images. This type of consistency check is commonly
used as a post-processing step in many stereo methods, e.g.
[54], but we incorporate it directly into our network.

3. Method

This section describes our single image depth prediction
network. We introduce a novel depth estimation training loss,
featuring an inbuilt left-right consistency check, which enables
us to train on image pairs without requiring supervision in the
form of ground truth depth.

3.1. Depth Estimation as Image Reconstruction

Given a single image I at test time, our goal is to learn a
function f that can predict the per-pixel scene depth, ˆd=f(I).
Most existing learning based approaches treat this as a
supervised learning problem, where they have color input

Figure 2. Our loss module outputs left and right disparity maps, dl
and dr. The loss combines smoothness, reconstruction, and left-right
disparity consistency terms. This same module is repeated at each of
the four different output scales. C: Convolution, UC: Up-Convolution,
S: Bilinear Sampling, US: Up-Sampling, SC: Skip Connection.

images and their corresponding target depth values at training. It
is presently not practical to acquire such ground truth depth data
for a large variety of scenes. Even expensive hardware, such
as laser scanners, can be imprecise in natural scenes featuring
movement and reflections. As an alternative, we instead pose
depth estimation as an image reconstruction problem during
training. The intuition here is that, given a calibrated pair of
binocular cameras, if we can learn a function that is able to
reconstruct one image from the other, then we have learned
something about the 3D shape of the scene that is being imaged.
Specifically, at training time, we have access to two images
Il and Ir, corresponding to the left and right color images from
a calibrated stereo pair, captured at the same moment in time.
Instead of trying to directly predict the depth, we attempt to
find the dense correspondence field dr that, when applied to the
left image, would enable us to reconstruct the right image. We
will refer to the reconstructed image Il(dr) as ˜Ir. Similarly, we
can also estimate the left image given the right one, ˜Il =Ir(dl).
Assuming that the images are rectified [19], d corresponds to
the image disparity - a scalar value per pixel that our model
will learn to predict. Given the baseline distance b between the
cameras and the camera focal length f, we can then trivially
recover the depth ˆd from the predicted disparity, ˆd=bf/d.

3.2. Depth Estimation Network

At a high level, our network estimates depth by inferring
the disparities that warp the left image to match the right one.
The key insight of our method is that we can simultaneously
infer both disparities (left-to-right and right-to-left), using only
the left input image, and obtain better depths by enforcing them
to be consistent with each other.

Our network generates the predicted image with backward
mapping using a bilinear sampler, resulting in a fully differen-
tiable image formation model. As illustrated in Fig. 3, na¨ıvely
learning to generate the right image by sampling from the left

smooth disparities, and Clr prefers the predicted left and right
disparities to be consistent. Each of the main terms contains
both a left and a right image variant, but only the left image
is fed through the convolutional layers.

Next, we present each component of our loss in terms of the

ap). The right image versions, e.g. Cr

Appearance Matching Loss During training, the network
learns to generate an image by sampling pixels from the
opposite stereo image. Our image formation model uses the
image sampler from the spatial transformer network (STN) [27]
to sample the input image using a disparity map. The STN uses
bilinear sampling where the output pixel is the weighted sum of
four input pixels. In contrast to alternative approaches [16, 53],
the bilinear sampler used is locally fully differentiable and
integrates seamlessly into our fully convolutional architecture.
This means that we do not require any simplification or
approximation of our cost function.

Inspired by [55], we use a combination of an L1 and
single scale SSIM [51] term as our photometric image
reconstruction cost Cap, which compares the input image Il

Disparity Smoothness Loss We encourage disparities to be

Left-Right Disparity Consistency Loss To produce more
accurate disparity maps, we train our network to predict both
the left and right image disparities, while only being given
the left view as input to the convolutional part of the network.
To ensure coherence, we introduce an L1 left-right disparity
consistency penalty as part of our model. This cost attempts
to make the left-view disparity map be equal to the projected

Our approach uses the left image to produce disparities for both

one will produce disparities aligned with the right image (target).
However, we want the output disparity map to align with the
input left image, meaning the network has to sample from the
right image. We could instead train the network to generate the
left view by sampling from the right image, thus creating a left
view aligned disparity map (No LR in Fig. 3). While this alone
works, the inferred disparities exhibit ‘texture-copy’ artifacts and
errors at depth discontinuities as seen in Fig. 5. We solve this by
training the network to predict the disparity maps for both views
by sampling from the opposite input images. This still only
requires a single left image as input to the convolutional layers
and the right image is only used during training (Ours in Fig. 3).
Enforcing consistency between both disparity maps using this
novel left-right consistency cost leads to more accurate results.
Our fully convolutional architecture is inspired by Disp-
Net [39], but features several important modifications that
enable us to train without requiring ground truth depth. Our net-
work, is composed of two main parts - an encoder (from cnv1 to
cnv7b) and decoder (from upcnv7), please see the supplementary
material for a detailed description. The decoder uses skip con-
nections [47] from the encoder’s activation blocks, enabling it to
resolve higher resolution details. We output disparity predictions
at four different scales (disp4 to disp1), which double in spatial
resolution at each of the subsequent scales. Even though it only
takes a single image as input, our network predicts two disparity
maps at each output scale - left-to-right and right-to-left.

Table 1. Comparison of different image formation models. Results on the KITTI 2015 stereo 200 training set disparity images [17]. For training,
K is the KITTI dataset [17] and CS is Cityscapes [8]. Our model with left-right consistency performs the best, and is further improved with the
addition of the Cityscapes data. The last row shows the result of our model trained and tested with two input images instead of one (see Sec. 4.3).

At test time, our network predicts the disparity at the finest
scale level for the left image dl, which has the same resolution
as the input image. Using the known camera baseline and focal
length from the training set, we then convert from the disparity
map to a depth map. While we also estimate the right disparity
dr during training, it is not used at test time.

4. Results

Here we compare the performance of our approach to both
supervised and unsupervised single view depth estimation
methods. We train on rectified stereo image pairs, and do
not require any supervision in the form of ground truth depth.
Existing single image datasets, such as [41, 45], that lack
stereo pairs, are not suitable for evaluation. Instead we evaluate
our approach using the popular KITTI 2015 [17] dataset. To
evaluate our image formation model, we compare to a variant
of our algorithm that uses the original Deep3D [53] image
formation model and a modified one, Deep3Ds, with an added
smoothness constraint. We also evaluate our approach with and
without the left-right consistency constraint.

4.1. Implementation Details

×

The network which is implemented in TensorFlow [1] con-
tains 31 million trainable parameters, and takes on the order of
25 hours to train using a single Titan X GPU on a dataset of 30
thousand images for 50 epochs. Inference is fast and takes less
than 35 ms, or more than 28 frames per second, for a 512
256
image, including transfer times to and from the GPU. Please
see the supplementary material and our code1 for more details.
During optimization, we set the weighting of the different
loss components to αap = 1 and αlr = 1. The possible output
disparities are constrained to be between 0 and dmax using a
scaled sigmoid non-linearity, where dmax = 0.3
the image
width at a given output scale. As a result of our multi-scale
output, the typical disparity of neighboring pixels will differ
by a factor of two between each scale (as we are upsampling
the output by a factor of two). To correct for this, we scale the
disparity smoothness term αds with r for each scale to get equiv-
alent smoothing at each level. Thus αds =0.1/r, where r is the

downscaling factor of the corresponding layer with respect to
the resolution of the input image that is passed into the network.
For the non-linearities in the network, we used exponential
linear units [7] instead of the commonly used rectified liner units
(ReLU) [40]. We found that ReLUs tended to prematurely fix
the predicted disparities at intermediate scales to a single value,
making subsequent improvement difficult. Following [42],
we replaced the usual deconvolutions with a nearest neighbor
upsampling followed by a convolutions. We trained our model
from scratch for 50 epochs, with a batch size of 8 using Adam
8. We used an
[30], where β1 = 0.9, β2 = 0.999, and (cid:15) = 10−
4 which we kept constant for the
initial learning rate of λ=10−
first 30 epochs before halving it every 10 epochs until the end.
We initially experimented with progressive update schedules,
as in [39], where lower resolution image scales were optimized
first. However, we found that optimizing all four scales at once
led to more stable convergence. Similarly, we use an identical
weighting for the loss of each scale as we found that weighting
them differently led to unstable convergence. We experimented
with batch normalization [26], but found that it did not produce
a significant improvement, and ultimately excluded it.

Data augmentation is performed on the fly. We flip the input
images horizontally with a 50% chance, taking care to also
swap both images so they are in the correct position relative
to each other. We also added color augmentations, with a
50% chance, where we performed random gamma, brightness,
and color shifts by sampling from uniform distributions in
the ranges [0.8,1.2] for gamma, [0.5,2.0] for brightness, and
[0.8,1.2] for each color channel separately.

Resnet50 For the sake of completeness, and similar to [33],
we also show a variant of our model using Resnet50 [20] as
the encoder, the rest of the architecture, parameters and training
procedure staying identical. This variant contains 48 million
trainable parameters and is indicated by resnet in result tables.

Post-processing In order to reduce the effect of stereo disoc-
clusions which create disparity ramps on both the left side of the
image and of the occluders, a final post-processing step is per-
formed on the output. For an input image I at test time, we also

compute the disparity map d(cid:48)l for its horizontally flipped image
I(cid:48). By flipping back this disparity map we obtain a disparity
map d(cid:48)(cid:48)l , which aligns with dl but where the disparity ramps are
located on the right of occluders as well as on the right side of the
image. We combine both disparity maps to form the final result
by assigning the first 5% on the left of the image using d(cid:48)(cid:48)l and
the last 5% on the right to the disparities from dl. The central
part of the final disparity map is the average of dl and d(cid:48)l. This
final post-processing step leads to both better accuracy and less
visual artifacts at the expense of doubling the amount of test time
computation. We indicate such results using pp in result tables.

4.2. KITTI

We present results for the KITTI dataset [17] using two
different test splits, to enable comparison to existing works. In its
raw form, the dataset contains 42,382 rectified stereo pairs from
375 pixels in size.
61 scenes, with a typical image being 1242

×

KITTI Split First we compare different variants of our
method including different image formation models and differ-
ent training sets. We evaluate on the 200 high quality disparity
images provided as part of the official KITTI training set, which
covers a total of 28 scenes. The remaining 33 scenes contain
30,159 images from which we keep 29,000 for training and the
rest for evaluation. While these disparity images are much better
quality than the reprojected velodyne laser depth values, they
have CAD models inserted in place of moving cars. These CAD
models result in ambiguous disparity values on transparent
surfaces such as car windows, and issues at object boundaries
where the CAD models do not perfectly align with the images.
In addition, the maximum depth present in the KITTI dataset is
on the order of 80 meters, and we cap the maximum predictions
of all networks to this value. Results are computed using the
depth metrics from [10] along with the D1-all disparity error
from KITTI [17]. The metrics from [10] measure error in both
meters from the ground truth and the percentage of depths that
are within some threshold from the correct value. It is important
to note that measuring the error in depth space while the ground
truth is given in disparities leads to precision issues. In particular,
the non-thresholded measures can be sensitive to the large errors
in depth caused by prediction errors at small disparity values.

In Table 1, we see that in addition to having poor scaling prop-

erties (in terms of both resolution and the number of disparities it
can represent), when trained from scratch with the same network
architecture as ours, the Deep3D [53] image formation model
performs poorly. From Fig. 6 we can see that Deep3D produces
plausible image reconstructions but the output disparities are in-
ferior to ours. Our loss outperforms both the Deep3D baselines
and the addition of the left-right consistency check increases per-
formance in all measures. In Fig. 5 we illustrate some zoomed
in comparisons, clearly showing that the inclusion of the left-
right check improves the visual quality of the results. Our results
are further improved by first pre-training our model with addi-
tional training data from the Cityscapes dataset [8] containing
22,973 training stereo pairs captured in various cities across Ger-
many. This dataset brings higher resolution, image quality, and
variety compared to KITTI, while having a similar setting. We
cropped the input images to only keep the top 80% of the image,
removing the very reflective car hoods from the input. Interest-
ingly, our model trained on Cityscapes alone does not perform
very well numerically. This is likely due to the difference in
camera calibration between the two datasets, but there is a clear
advantage to fine-tuning on data that is related to the test set.

Eigen Split To be able to compare to existing work, we also
use the test split of 697 images as proposed by [10] which
covers a total of 29 scenes. The remaining 32 scenes contain
23,488 images from which we keep 22,600 for training and the
rest for evaluation, similarly to [16]. To generate the ground
truth depth images, we reproject the 3D points viewed from the
velodyne laser into the left input color camera. Aside from only
producing depth values for less than 5% of the pixels in the
input image, errors are also introduced because of the rotation

predictions of Liu et al. [36]* are generated on a mix of the left and right images instead of just the left input images. For a fair comparison, we
compute their results relative to the correct image. As in the provided source code, Eigen et al. [10]◦ results are computed relative to the velodyne
instead of the camera. Garg et al. [16] results are taken directly from their paper. All results, except [10], use the crop from [16]. We also show
our results with the same crop and maximum evaluation distance. The last two rows are computed on the uncropped ground truth.

of the Velodyne, the motion of the vehicle and surrounding
objects, and also incorrect depth readings due to occlusion at
object boundaries. To be fair to all methods, we use the same
crop as [10] and evaluate at the input image resolution. With the
exception of Garg et al.’s [16] results, the results of the baseline
methods are recomputed by us given the authors’s original
predictions to ensure that all the scores are directly comparable.
This produces slightly different numbers than the previously
published ones, e.g. in the case of [10], their predictions were
evaluated on much smaller depth images (1/4 the original size).
For all baseline methods we use bilinear interpolation to resize
the predictions to the correct input image size.

Table 2 shows quantitative results with some example
outputs shown in Fig. 4. We see that our algorithm outperforms
all other existing methods, including those that are trained with
ground truth depth data. We again see that pre-training on the
Cityscapes dataset improves the results over using KITTI alone.

4.3. Stereo

We also implemented a stereo version of our model, see
Fig. 8, where the network’s input is the concatenation of both
left and right views. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the stereo models
outperforms our monocular network on every single metric,
especially on the D1-all disparity measure, as can be seen
in Table 1. This model was only trained for 12 epochs as it
becomes unstable if trained for longer.

4.4. Make3D

To illustrate that our method can generalize to other datasets,
here we compare to several fully supervised methods on the
Make3D test set of [45]. Make3D consists of only RGB/Depth
pairs and no stereo images, thus our method cannot train on this
data. We use our network trained only on the Cityscapes dataset
and despite the dissimilarities in the datasets, both in content
and camera parameters, we still achieve reasonable results,
even beating [28] on one metric and [37] on three. Due to the
different aspect ratio of the Make3D dataset we evaluate on a
central crop of the images. In Table 3, we compare our output to
the similarly cropped results of the other methods. As in the case
of the KITTI dataset, these results would likely be improved
with more relevant training data. A qualitative comparison to
some of the related methods is shown in Fig. 7. While our
numerical results are not as good as the baselines, qualitatively,
we compare favorably to the supervised competition.

4.5. Generalizing to Other Datasets

Finally, we illustrate some further examples of our model
generalizing to other datasets in Figure 9. Using the model only
trained on Cityscapes [8], we tested on the CamVid driving
dataset [4]. In the accompanying video and the supplementary
material we can see that despite the differences in location,
image characteristics, and camera calibration, our model still

4.6. Limitations

Even though both our left-right consistency check and post-
processing improve the quality of the results, there are still some
artifacts visible at occlusion boundaries due to the pixels in the
occlusion region not being visible in both images. Explicitly rea-
soning about occlusion during training [23, 25] could improve
these issues. It is worth noting that depending how large the base-
line between the camera and the depth sensor, fully supervised
approaches also do not always have valid depth for all pixels.

Our method requires rectified and temporally aligned
stereo pairs during training, which means that it is currently
not possible to use existing single-view datasets for training
purposes e.g. [41]. However, it is possible to fine-tune our
model on application specific ground truth depth data.

Finally, our method mainly relies on the image reconstruc-
tion term, meaning that specular [18] and transparent surfaces
will produce inconsistent depths. This could be improved with
more sophisticated similarity measures [54].

5. Conclusion

We have presented an unsupervised deep neural network for
single image depth estimation. Instead of using aligned ground
truth depth data, which is both rare and costly, we exploit the
ease with which binocular stereo data can be captured. Our
novel loss function enforces consistency between the predicted
depth maps from each camera view during training, improving
predictions. Our results are superior to fully supervised
baselines, which is encouraging for future research that does
not require expensive to capture ground truth depth. We have
also shown that our model can generalize to unseen datasets
and still produce visually plausible depth maps.

In future work, we would like to extend our model to
videos. While our current depth estimates are performed
independently per frame, adding temporal consistency [28]
would likely improve results. It would also be interesting to
investigate sparse input as an alternative training signal [58, 6].
Finally, while our model estimates per pixel depth, it would be
interesting to also predict the full occupancy of the scene [11].

Abstract

Learning based methods have shown very promising results
for the task of depth estimation in single images. However,
most existing approaches treat depth prediction as a supervised
regression problem and as a result, require vast quantities
of corresponding ground truth depth data for training. Just
recording quality depth data in a range of environments is a
challenging problem. In this paper, we innovate beyond existing
approaches, replacing the use of explicit depth data during
training with easier-to-obtain binocular stereo footage.

We propose a novel training objective that enables our convo-
lutional neural network to learn to perform single image depth
estimation, despite the absence of ground truth depth data. Ex-
ploiting epipolar geometry constraints, we generate disparity
images by training our network with an image reconstruction
loss. We show that solving for image reconstruction alone re-
sults in poor quality depth images. To overcome this problem,
we propose a novel training loss that enforces consistency be-
tween the disparities produced relative to both the left and right
images, leading to improved performance and robustness com-
pared to existing approaches. Our method produces state of the
art results for monocular depth estimation on the KITTI driving
dataset, even outperforming supervised methods that have been
trained with ground truth depth.

1. Introduction

Depth estimation from images has a long history in computer
vision. Fruitful approaches have relied on structure from motion,
shape-from-X, binocular, and multi-view stereo. However, most
of these techniques rely on the assumption that multiple obser-
vations of the scene of interest are available. These can come
in the form of multiple viewpoints, or observations of the scene
under different lighting conditions. To overcome this limitation,
there has recently been a surge in the number of works that pose
the task of monocular depth estimation as a supervised learning
problem [32, 10, 36]. These methods attempt to directly predict
the depth of each pixel in an image using models that have been
trained offline on large collections of ground truth depth data.
While these methods have enjoyed great success, to date they

have been restricted to scenes where large image collections
and their corresponding pixel depths are available.

Understanding the shape of a scene from a single image,
independent of its appearance, is a fundamental problem in
machine perception. There are many applications such as
synthetic object insertion in computer graphics [29], synthetic
depth of field in computational photography [3], grasping
in robotics [34], using depth as a cue in human body pose
estimation [48], robot assisted surgery [49], and automatic 2D
to 3D conversion in film [53]. Accurate depth data from one
or more cameras is also crucial for self-driving cars, where
expensive laser-based systems are often used.

Humans perform well at monocular depth estimation by
exploiting cues such as perspective, scaling relative to the
known size of familiar objects, appearance in the form of
lighting and shading and occlusion [24]. This combination of
both top-down and bottom-up cues appears to link full scene
understanding with our ability to accurately estimate depth. In
this work, we take an alternative approach and treat automatic
depth estimation as an image reconstruction problem during
training. Our fully convolutional model does not require any
depth data, and is instead trained to synthesize depth as an
intermediate. It learns to predict the pixel-level correspondence
between pairs of rectified stereo images that have a known
camera baseline. There are some existing methods that also
address the same problem, but with several limitations. For
example they are not fully differentiable, making training
suboptimal [16], or have image formation models that do

not scale to large output resolutions [53]. We improve upon
these methods with a novel training objective and enhanced
network architecture that significantly increases the quality
of our final results. An example result from our algorithm is
illustrated in Fig. 1. Our method is fast and only takes on the
order of 35 milliseconds to predict a dense depth map for a
512
256 image on a modern GPU. Specifically, we propose
the following contributions:
1) A network architecture that performs end-to-end unsuper-
vised monocular depth estimation with a novel training loss that
enforces left-right depth consistency inside the network.
2) An evaluation of several training losses and image formation
models highlighting the effectiveness of our approach.
3) In addition to showing state of the art results on a challenging
driving dataset, we also show that our model generalizes to three
different datasets, including a new outdoor urban dataset that
we have collected ourselves, which we make openly available.

2. Related Work

There is a large body of work that focuses on depth
estimation from images, either using pairs [46], several
overlapping images captured from different viewpoints [14],
temporal sequences [44], or assuming a fixed camera, static
scene, and changing lighting [52, 2]. These approaches are
typically only applicable when there is more than one input
image available of the scene of interest. Here we focus on
works related to monocular depth estimation, where there is
only a single input image, and no assumptions about the scene
geometry or types of objects present are made.

Learning-Based Stereo

The vast majority of stereo estimation algorithms have a data
term which computes the similarity between each pixel in the
first image and every other pixel in the second image. Typically
the stereo pair is rectified and thus the problem of disparity (i.e.
scaled inverse depth) estimation can be posed as a 1D search
problem for each pixel. Recently, it has been shown that instead
of using hand defined similarity measures, treating the matching
as a supervised learning problem and training a function to
predict the correspondences produces far superior results
[54, 31]. It has also been shown that posing this binocular
correspondence search as a multi-class classification problem
has advantages both in terms of quality of results and speed
[38]. Instead of just learning the matching function, Mayer
et al. [39] introduced a fully convolutional [47] deep network
called DispNet that directly computes the correspondence
field between two images. At training time, they attempt to
directly predict the disparity for each pixel by minimizing a
regression training loss. DispNet has a similar architecture to
their previous end-to-end deep optical flow network [12].

The above methods rely on having large amounts of accurate
ground truth disparity data and stereo image pairs at training
time. This type of data can be difficult to obtain for real world

scenes, so these approaches typically use synthetic data for
training. Synthetic data is becoming more realistic, e.g. [15],
but still requires the manual creation of new content for every
new application scenario.

Single-view, or monocular, depth estimation refers to the
problem setup where only a single image is available at test
time. Saxena et al. [45] proposed a patch-based model known
as Make3D that first over-segments the input image into patches
and then estimates the 3D location and orientation of local
planes to explain each patch. The predictions of the plane
parameters are made using a linear model trained offline on
a dataset of laser scans, and the predictions are then combined
together using an MRF. The disadvantage of this method, and
other planar based approximations, e.g. [22], is that they can
have difficulty modeling thin structures and, as predictions
are made locally, lack the global context required to generate
realistic outputs. Instead of hand-tuning the unary and pairwise
terms, Liu et al. [36] use a convolutional neural network (CNN)
to learn them. In another local approach, Ladicky et al. [32]
incorporate semantics into their model to improve their per
pixel depth estimation. Karsch et al. [28] attempt to produce
more consistent image level predictions by copying whole depth
images from a training set. A drawback of this approach is that
it requires the entire training set to be available at test time.

Eigen et al. [10, 9] showed that it was possible to produce
dense pixel depth estimates using a two scale deep network
trained on images and their corresponding depth values. Unlike
most other previous work in single image depth estimation,
they do not rely on hand crafted features or an initial over-
segmentation and instead learn a representation directly from
the raw pixel values. Several works have built upon the success
of this approach using techniques such as CRFs to improve accu-
racy [35], changing the loss from regression to classification [5],
using other more robust loss functions [33], and incorporating
strong scene priors in the case of the related problem of surface
normal estimation [50]. Again, like the previous stereo methods,
these approaches rely on having high quality, pixel aligned,
ground truth depth at training time. We too perform single
depth image estimation, but train with an added binocular color
image, instead of requiring ground truth depth.

Unsupervised Depth Estimation

Recently, a small number of deep network based methods for
novel view synthesis and depth estimation have been proposed,
which do not require ground truth depth at training time. Flynn et
al. [13] introduced a novel image synthesis network called Deep-
Stereo that generates new views by selecting pixels from nearby
images. During training, the relative pose of multiple cameras
is used to predict the appearance of a held-out nearby image.
Then the most appropriate depths are selected to sample colors
from the neighboring images, based on plane sweep volumes.

At test time, image synthesis is performed on small overlapping
patches. As it requires several nearby posed images at test time
DeepStereo is not suitable for monocular depth estimation.

The Deep3D network of Xie et al. [53] also addresses the
problem of novel view synthesis, where their goal is to generate
the corresponding right view from an input left image (i.e. the
source image) in the context of binocular pairs. Again using an
image reconstruction loss, their method produces a distribution
over all the possible disparities for each pixel. The resulting
synthesized right image pixel values are a combination of the
pixels on the same scan line from the left image, weighted
by the probability of each disparity. The disadvantage of
their image formation model is that increasing the number
of candidate disparity values greatly increases the memory
consumption of the algorithm, making it difficult to scale their
approach to bigger output resolutions. In this work, we perform
a comparison to the Deep3D image formation model, and show
that our algorithm produces superior results.

Closest to our model in spirit is the concurrent work of
Garg et al. [16]. Like Deep3D and our method, they train
a network for monocular depth estimation using an image
reconstruction loss. However, their image formation model is
not fully differentiable. To compensate, they perform a Taylor
approximation to linearize their loss resulting in an objective
that is more challenging to optimize. Similar to other recent
work, e.g. [43, 56, 57], our model overcomes this problem by
using bilinear sampling [27] to generate images, resulting in
a fully (sub-)differentiable training loss.

We propose a fully convolutional deep neural network
loosely inspired by the supervised DispNet architecture of
Mayer et al. [39]. By posing monocular depth estimation
as an image reconstruction problem, we can solve for the
disparity field without requiring ground truth depth. However,
only minimizing a photometric loss can result in good quality
image reconstructions but poor quality depth. Among other
terms, our fully differentiable training loss includes a left-right
consistency check to improve the quality of our synthesized
depth images. This type of consistency check is commonly
used as a post-processing step in many stereo methods, e.g.
[54], but we incorporate it directly into our network.

3. Method

This section describes our single image depth prediction
network. We introduce a novel depth estimation training loss,
featuring an inbuilt left-right consistency check, which enables
us to train on image pairs without requiring supervision in the
form of ground truth depth.

3.1. Depth Estimation as Image Reconstruction

Given a single image I at test time, our goal is to learn a
function f that can predict the per-pixel scene depth, ˆd=f(I).
Most existing learning based approaches treat this as a
supervised learning problem, where they have color input

Figure 2. Our loss module outputs left and right disparity maps, dl
and dr. The loss combines smoothness, reconstruction, and left-right
disparity consistency terms. This same module is repeated at each of
the four different output scales. C: Convolution, UC: Up-Convolution,

images and their corresponding target depth values at training. It
is presently not practical to acquire such ground truth depth data
for a large variety of scenes. Even expensive hardware, such
as laser scanners, can be imprecise in natural scenes featuring
movement and reflections. As an alternative, we instead pose
depth estimation as an image reconstruction problem during
training. The intuition here is that, given a calibrated pair of
binocular cameras, if we can learn a function that is able to
reconstruct one image from the other, then we have learned
something about the 3D shape of the scene that is being imaged.
Specifically, at training time, we have access to two images
Il and Ir, corresponding to the left and right color images from
a calibrated stereo pair, captured at the same moment in time.
Instead of trying to directly predict the depth, we attempt to
find the dense correspondence field dr that, when applied to the
left image, would enable us to reconstruct the right image. We
will refer to the reconstructed image Il(dr) as ˜Ir. Similarly, we
can also estimate the left image given the right one, ˜Il =Ir(dl).
Assuming that the images are rectified [19], d corresponds to
the image disparity - a scalar value per pixel that our model
will learn to predict. Given the baseline distance b between the
cameras and the camera focal length f, we can then trivially
recover the depth ˆd from the predicted disparity, ˆd=bf/d.

3.2. Depth Estimation Network

At a high level, our network estimates depth by inferring
the disparities that warp the left image to match the right one.
The key insight of our method is that we can simultaneously
infer both disparities (left-to-right and right-to-left), using only
the left input image, and obtain better depths by enforcing them
to be consistent with each other.

Our network generates the predicted image with backward
mapping using a bilinear sampler, resulting in a fully differen-
tiable image formation model. As illustrated in Fig. 3, na¨ıvely
learning to generate the right image by sampling from the left

smooth disparities, and Clr prefers the predicted left and right
disparities to be consistent. Each of the main terms contains
both a left and a right image variant, but only the left image
is fed through the convolutional layers.

Next, we present each component of our loss in terms of the

ap). The right image versions, e.g. Cr

Appearance Matching Loss During training, the network
learns to generate an image by sampling pixels from the
opposite stereo image. Our image formation model uses the
image sampler from the spatial transformer network (STN) [27]
to sample the input image using a disparity map. The STN uses
bilinear sampling where the output pixel is the weighted sum of
four input pixels. In contrast to alternative approaches [16, 53],
the bilinear sampler used is locally fully differentiable and
integrates seamlessly into our fully convolutional architecture.
This means that we do not require any simplification or
approximation of our cost function.

Inspired by [55], we use a combination of an L1 and
single scale SSIM [51] term as our photometric image
reconstruction cost Cap, which compares the input image Il

Disparity Smoothness Loss We encourage disparities to be

Left-Right Disparity Consistency Loss To produce more
accurate disparity maps, we train our network to predict both
the left and right image disparities, while only being given
the left view as input to the convolutional part of the network.
To ensure coherence, we introduce an L1 left-right disparity
consistency penalty as part of our model. This cost attempts
to make the left-view disparity map be equal to the projected

Our approach uses the left image to produce disparities for both

one will produce disparities aligned with the right image (target).
However, we want the output disparity map to align with the
input left image, meaning the network has to sample from the
right image. We could instead train the network to generate the
left view by sampling from the right image, thus creating a left
view aligned disparity map (No LR in Fig. 3). While this alone
works, the inferred disparities exhibit ‘texture-copy’ artifacts and
errors at depth discontinuities as seen in Fig. 5. We solve this by
training the network to predict the disparity maps for both views
by sampling from the opposite input images. This still only
requires a single left image as input to the convolutional layers
and the right image is only used during training (Ours in Fig. 3).
Enforcing consistency between both disparity maps using this
novel left-right consistency cost leads to more accurate results.
Our fully convolutional architecture is inspired by Disp-
Net [39], but features several important modifications that
enable us to train without requiring ground truth depth. Our net-
work, is composed of two main parts - an encoder (from cnv1 to
cnv7b) and decoder (from upcnv7), please see the supplementary
material for a detailed description. The decoder uses skip con-
nections [47] from the encoder’s activation blocks, enabling it to
resolve higher resolution details. We output disparity predictions
at four different scales (disp4 to disp1), which double in spatial
resolution at each of the subsequent scales. Even though it only
takes a single image as input, our network predicts two disparity
maps at each output scale - left-to-right and right-to-left.

Table 1. Comparison of different image formation models. Results on the KITTI 2015 stereo 200 training set disparity images [17]. For training,
K is the KITTI dataset [17] and CS is Cityscapes [8]. Our model with left-right consistency performs the best, and is further improved with the
addition of the Cityscapes data. The last row shows the result of our model trained and tested with two input images instead of one (see Sec. 4.3).

At test time, our network predicts the disparity at the finest
scale level for the left image dl, which has the same resolution
as the input image. Using the known camera baseline and focal
length from the training set, we then convert from the disparity
map to a depth map. While we also estimate the right disparity
dr during training, it is not used at test time.

4. Results

Here we compare the performance of our approach to both
supervised and unsupervised single view depth estimation
methods. We train on rectified stereo image pairs, and do
not require any supervision in the form of ground truth depth.
Existing single image datasets, such as [41, 45], that lack
stereo pairs, are not suitable for evaluation. Instead we evaluate
our approach using the popular KITTI 2015 [17] dataset. To
evaluate our image formation model, we compare to a variant
of our algorithm that uses the original Deep3D [53] image
formation model and a modified one, Deep3Ds, with an added
smoothness constraint. We also evaluate our approach with and
without the left-right consistency constraint.

4.1. Implementation Details

×

The network which is implemented in TensorFlow [1] con-
tains 31 million trainable parameters, and takes on the order of
25 hours to train using a single Titan X GPU on a dataset of 30
thousand images for 50 epochs. Inference is fast and takes less
than 35 ms, or more than 28 frames per second, for a 512
256
image, including transfer times to and from the GPU. Please
see the supplementary material and our code1 for more details.
During optimization, we set the weighting of the different
loss components to αap = 1 and αlr = 1. The possible output
disparities are constrained to be between 0 and dmax using a
scaled sigmoid non-linearity, where dmax = 0.3

width at a given output scale. As a result of our multi-scale
output, the typical disparity of neighboring pixels will differ
by a factor of two between each scale (as we are upsampling
the output by a factor of two). To correct for this, we scale the
disparity smoothness term αds with r for each scale to get equiv-
alent smoothing at each level. Thus αds =0.1/r, where r is the

downscaling factor of the corresponding layer with respect to
the resolution of the input image that is passed into the network.
For the non-linearities in the network, we used exponential
linear units [7] instead of the commonly used rectified liner units
(ReLU) [40]. We found that ReLUs tended to prematurely fix
the predicted disparities at intermediate scales to a single value,
making subsequent improvement difficult. Following [42],
we replaced the usual deconvolutions with a nearest neighbor
upsampling followed by a convolutions. We trained our model
from scratch for 50 epochs, with a batch size of 8 using Adam
8. We used an

4 which we kept constant for the
initial learning rate of λ=10−
first 30 epochs before halving it every 10 epochs until the end.
We initially experimented with progressive update schedules,
as in [39], where lower resolution image scales were optimized
first. However, we found that optimizing all four scales at once
led to more stable convergence. Similarly, we use an identical
weighting for the loss of each scale as we found that weighting
them differently led to unstable convergence. We experimented
with batch normalization [26], but found that it did not produce
a significant improvement, and ultimately excluded it.

Data augmentation is performed on the fly. We flip the input
images horizontally with a 50% chance, taking care to also
swap both images so they are in the correct position relative
to each other. We also added color augmentations, with a
50% chance, where we performed random gamma, brightness,
and color shifts by sampling from uniform distributions in
the ranges [0.8,1.2] for gamma, [0.5,2.0] for brightness, and
[0.8,1.2] for each color channel separately.

Resnet50 For the sake of completeness, and similar to [33],
we also show a variant of our model using Resnet50 [20] as
the encoder, the rest of the architecture, parameters and training
procedure staying identical. This variant contains 48 million
trainable parameters and is indicated by resnet in result tables.

Post-processing In order to reduce the effect of stereo disoc-
clusions which create disparity ramps on both the left side of the
image and of the occluders, a final post-processing step is per-
formed on the output. For an input image I at test time, we also

compute the disparity map d(cid:48)l for its horizontally flipped image
I(cid:48). By flipping back this disparity map we obtain a disparity
map d(cid:48)(cid:48)l , which aligns with dl but where the disparity ramps are
located on the right of occluders as well as on the right side of the
image. We combine both disparity maps to form the final result
by assigning the first 5% on the left of the image using d(cid:48)(cid:48)l and
the last 5% on the right to the disparities from dl. The central
part of the final disparity map is the average of dl and d(cid:48)l. This
final post-processing step leads to both better accuracy and less
visual artifacts at the expense of doubling the amount of test time
computation. We indicate such results using pp in result tables.

4.2. KITTI

We present results for the KITTI dataset [17] using two
different test splits, to enable comparison to existing works. In its
raw form, the dataset contains 42,382 rectified stereo pairs from
375 pixels in size.
61 scenes, with a typical image being 1242

×

KITTI Split First we compare different variants of our
method including different image formation models and differ-
ent training sets. We evaluate on the 200 high quality disparity
images provided as part of the official KITTI training set, which
covers a total of 28 scenes. The remaining 33 scenes contain
30,159 images from which we keep 29,000 for training and the
rest for evaluation. While these disparity images are much better
quality than the reprojected velodyne laser depth values, they
have CAD models inserted in place of moving cars. These CAD
models result in ambiguous disparity values on transparent
surfaces such as car windows, and issues at object boundaries
where the CAD models do not perfectly align with the images.
In addition, the maximum depth present in the KITTI dataset is
on the order of 80 meters, and we cap the maximum predictions
of all networks to this value. Results are computed using the
depth metrics from [10] along with the D1-all disparity error
from KITTI [17]. The metrics from [10] measure error in both
meters from the ground truth and the percentage of depths that
are within some threshold from the correct value. It is important
to note that measuring the error in depth space while the ground
truth is given in disparities leads to precision issues. In particular,
the non-thresholded measures can be sensitive to the large errors
in depth caused by prediction errors at small disparity values.

In Table 1, we see that in addition to having poor scaling prop-

erties (in terms of both resolution and the number of disparities it
can represent), when trained from scratch with the same network
architecture as ours, the Deep3D [53] image formation model
performs poorly. From Fig. 6 we can see that Deep3D produces
plausible image reconstructions but the output disparities are in-
ferior to ours. Our loss outperforms both the Deep3D baselines
and the addition of the left-right consistency check increases per-
formance in all measures. In Fig. 5 we illustrate some zoomed
in comparisons, clearly showing that the inclusion of the left-
right check improves the visual quality of the results. Our results
are further improved by first pre-training our model with addi-
tional training data from the Cityscapes dataset [8] containing
22,973 training stereo pairs captured in various cities across Ger-
many. This dataset brings higher resolution, image quality, and
variety compared to KITTI, while having a similar setting. We
cropped the input images to only keep the top 80% of the image,
removing the very reflective car hoods from the input. Interest-
ingly, our model trained on Cityscapes alone does not perform
very well numerically. This is likely due to the difference in
camera calibration between the two datasets, but there is a clear
advantage to fine-tuning on data that is related to the test set.

Eigen Split To be able to compare to existing work, we also
use the test split of 697 images as proposed by [10] which
covers a total of 29 scenes. The remaining 32 scenes contain
23,488 images from which we keep 22,600 for training and the
rest for evaluation, similarly to [16]. To generate the ground
truth depth images, we reproject the 3D points viewed from the
velodyne laser into the left input color camera. Aside from only
producing depth values for less than 5% of the pixels in the
input image, errors are also introduced because of the rotation

instead of the camera. Garg et al. [16] results are taken directly from their paper. All results, except [10], use the crop from [16]. We also show
our results with the same crop and maximum evaluation distance. The last two rows are computed on the uncropped ground truth.

of the Velodyne, the motion of the vehicle and surrounding
objects, and also incorrect depth readings due to occlusion at
object boundaries. To be fair to all methods, we use the same
crop as [10] and evaluate at the input image resolution. With the
exception of Garg et al.’s [16] results, the results of the baseline
methods are recomputed by us given the authors’s original
predictions to ensure that all the scores are directly comparable.
This produces slightly different numbers than the previously
published ones, e.g. in the case of [10], their predictions were
evaluated on much smaller depth images (1/4 the original size).
For all baseline methods we use bilinear interpolation to resize
the predictions to the correct input image size.

Table 2 shows quantitative results with some example
outputs shown in Fig. 4. We see that our algorithm outperforms
all other existing methods, including those that are trained with
ground truth depth data. We again see that pre-training on the
Cityscapes dataset improves the results over using KITTI alone.

4.3. Stereo

We also implemented a stereo version of our model, see
Fig. 8, where the network’s input is the concatenation of both
left and right views. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the stereo models
outperforms our monocular network on every single metric,
especially on the D1-all disparity measure, as can be seen
in Table 1. This model was only trained for 12 epochs as it
becomes unstable if trained for longer.

4.4. Make3D

To illustrate that our method can generalize to other datasets,
here we compare to several fully supervised methods on the
Make3D test set of [45]. Make3D consists of only RGB/Depth
pairs and no stereo images, thus our method cannot train on this
data. We use our network trained only on the Cityscapes dataset
and despite the dissimilarities in the datasets, both in content
and camera parameters, we still achieve reasonable results,
even beating [28] on one metric and [37] on three. Due to the
different aspect ratio of the Make3D dataset we evaluate on a
central crop of the images. In Table 3, we compare our output to
the similarly cropped results of the other methods. As in the case
of the KITTI dataset, these results would likely be improved
with more relevant training data. A qualitative comparison to
some of the related methods is shown in Fig. 7. While our
numerical results are not as good as the baselines, qualitatively,
we compare favorably to the supervised competition.

4.5. Generalizing to Other Datasets

Finally, we illustrate some further examples of our model
generalizing to other datasets in Figure 9. Using the model only
trained on Cityscapes [8], we tested on the CamVid driving
dataset [4]. In the accompanying video and the supplementary
material we can see that despite the differences in location,
image characteristics, and camera calibration, our model still

4.6. Limitations

Even though both our left-right consistency check and post-
processing improve the quality of the results, there are still some
artifacts visible at occlusion boundaries due to the pixels in the
occlusion region not being visible in both images. Explicitly rea-
soning about occlusion during training [23, 25] could improve
these issues. It is worth noting that depending how large the base-
line between the camera and the depth sensor, fully supervised
approaches also do not always have valid depth for all pixels.

Our method requires rectified and temporally aligned
stereo pairs during training, which means that it is currently
not possible to use existing single-view datasets for training
purposes e.g. [41]. However, it is possible to fine-tune our
model on application specific ground truth depth data.

Finally, our method mainly relies on the image reconstruc-
tion term, meaning that specular [18] and transparent surfaces
will produce inconsistent depths. This could be improved with
more sophisticated similarity measures [54].

5. Conclusion

We have presented an unsupervised deep neural network for
single image depth estimation. Instead of using aligned ground
truth depth data, which is both rare and costly, we exploit the
ease with which binocular stereo data can be captured. Our
novel loss function enforces consistency between the predicted
depth maps from each camera view during training, improving
predictions. Our results are superior to fully supervised
baselines, which is encouraging for future research that does
not require expensive to capture ground truth depth. We have
also shown that our model can generalize to unseen datasets
and still produce visually plausible depth maps.

In future work, we would like to extend our model to
videos. While our current depth estimates are performed
independently per frame, adding temporal consistency [28]
would likely improve results. It would also be interesting to
investigate sparse input as an alternative training signal [58, 6].
Finally, while our model estimates per pixel depth, it would be
interesting to also predict the full occupancy of the scene [11].

Abstract

Learning based methods have shown very promising results
for the task of depth estimation in single images. However,
most existing approaches treat depth prediction as a supervised
regression problem and as a result, require vast quantities
of corresponding ground truth depth data for training. Just
recording quality depth data in a range of environments is a
challenging problem. In this paper, we innovate beyond existing
approaches, replacing the use of explicit depth data during
training with easier-to-obtain binocular stereo footage.

We propose a novel training objective that enables our convo-
lutional neural network to learn to perform single image depth
estimation, despite the absence of ground truth depth data. Ex-
ploiting epipolar geometry constraints, we generate disparity
images by training our network with an image reconstruction
loss. We show that solving for image reconstruction alone re-
sults in poor quality depth images. To overcome this problem,
we propose a novel training loss that enforces consistency be-
tween the disparities produced relative to both the left and right
images, leading to improved performance and robustness com-
pared to existing approaches. Our method produces state of the
art results for monocular depth estimation on the KITTI driving
dataset, even outperforming supervised methods that have been
trained with ground truth depth.

1. Introduction

Depth estimation from images has a long history in computer
vision. Fruitful approaches have relied on structure from motion,
shape-from-X, binocular, and multi-view stereo. However, most
of these techniques rely on the assumption that multiple obser-
vations of the scene of interest are available. These can come
in the form of multiple viewpoints, or observations of the scene
under different lighting conditions. To overcome this limitation,
there has recently been a surge in the number of works that pose
the task of monocular depth estimation as a supervised learning
problem [32, 10, 36]. These methods attempt to directly predict
the depth of each pixel in an image using models that have been
trained offline on large collections of ground truth depth data.
While these methods have enjoyed great success, to date they

have been restricted to scenes where large image collections
and their corresponding pixel depths are available.

Understanding the shape of a scene from a single image,
independent of its appearance, is a fundamental problem in
machine perception. There are many applications such as
synthetic object insertion in computer graphics [29], synthetic
depth of field in computational photography [3], grasping
in robotics [34], using depth as a cue in human body pose
estimation [48], robot assisted surgery [49], and automatic 2D
to 3D conversion in film [53]. Accurate depth data from one
or more cameras is also crucial for self-driving cars, where
expensive laser-based systems are often used.

Humans perform well at monocular depth estimation by
exploiting cues such as perspective, scaling relative to the
known size of familiar objects, appearance in the form of
lighting and shading and occlusion [24]. This combination of
both top-down and bottom-up cues appears to link full scene
understanding with our ability to accurately estimate depth. In
this work, we take an alternative approach and treat automatic
depth estimation as an image reconstruction problem during
training. Our fully convolutional model does not require any
depth data, and is instead trained to synthesize depth as an
intermediate. It learns to predict the pixel-level correspondence
between pairs of rectified stereo images that have a known
camera baseline. There are some existing methods that also
address the same problem, but with several limitations. For
example they are not fully differentiable, making training
suboptimal [16], or have image formation models that do

not scale to large output resolutions [53]. We improve upon
these methods with a novel training objective and enhanced
network architecture that significantly increases the quality
of our final results. An example result from our algorithm is
illustrated in Fig. 1. Our method is fast and only takes on the
order of 35 milliseconds to predict a dense depth map for a
512
256 image on a modern GPU. Specifically, we propose
the following contributions:
1) A network architecture that performs end-to-end unsuper-
vised monocular depth estimation with a novel training loss that
enforces left-right depth consistency inside the network.
2) An evaluation of several training losses and image formation
models highlighting the effectiveness of our approach.
3) In addition to showing state of the art results on a challenging
driving dataset, we also show that our model generalizes to three
different datasets, including a new outdoor urban dataset that
we have collected ourselves, which we make openly available.

2. Related Work

There is a large body of work that focuses on depth
estimation from images, either using pairs [46], several
overlapping images captured from different viewpoints [14],
temporal sequences [44], or assuming a fixed camera, static
scene, and changing lighting [52, 2]. These approaches are
typically only applicable when there is more than one input
image available of the scene of interest. Here we focus on
works related to monocular depth estimation, where there is
only a single input image, and no assumptions about the scene
geometry or types of objects present are made.

Learning-Based Stereo

The vast majority of stereo estimation algorithms have a data
term which computes the similarity between each pixel in the
first image and every other pixel in the second image. Typically
the stereo pair is rectified and thus the problem of disparity (i.e.
scaled inverse depth) estimation can be posed as a 1D search
problem for each pixel. Recently, it has been shown that instead
of using hand defined similarity measures, treating the matching
as a supervised learning problem and training a function to
predict the correspondences produces far superior results
[54, 31]. It has also been shown that posing this binocular
correspondence search as a multi-class classification problem
has advantages both in terms of quality of results and speed
[38]. Instead of just learning the matching function, Mayer
et al. [39] introduced a fully convolutional [47] deep network
called DispNet that directly computes the correspondence
field between two images. At training time, they attempt to
directly predict the disparity for each pixel by minimizing a
regression training loss. DispNet has a similar architecture to
their previous end-to-end deep optical flow network [12].

The above methods rely on having large amounts of accurate
ground truth disparity data and stereo image pairs at training
time. This type of data can be difficult to obtain for real world

scenes, so these approaches typically use synthetic data for
training. Synthetic data is becoming more realistic, e.g. [15],
but still requires the manual creation of new content for every
new application scenario.

Supervised Single Image Depth Estimation

Single-view, or monocular, depth estimation refers to the
problem setup where only a single image is available at test
time. Saxena et al. [45] proposed a patch-based model known
as Make3D that first over-segments the input image into patches
and then estimates the 3D location and orientation of local
planes to explain each patch. The predictions of the plane
parameters are made using a linear model trained offline on
a dataset of laser scans, and the predictions are then combined
together using an MRF. The disadvantage of this method, and
other planar based approximations, e.g. [22], is that they can
have difficulty modeling thin structures and, as predictions
are made locally, lack the global context required to generate
realistic outputs. Instead of hand-tuning the unary and pairwise
terms, Liu et al. [36] use a convolutional neural network (CNN)
to learn them. In another local approach, Ladicky et al. [32]
incorporate semantics into their model to improve their per
pixel depth estimation. Karsch et al. [28] attempt to produce
more consistent image level predictions by copying whole depth
images from a training set. A drawback of this approach is that
it requires the entire training set to be available at test time.

Eigen et al. [10, 9] showed that it was possible to produce
dense pixel depth estimates using a two scale deep network
trained on images and their corresponding depth values. Unlike
most other previous work in single image depth estimation,
they do not rely on hand crafted features or an initial over-
segmentation and instead learn a representation directly from
the raw pixel values. Several works have built upon the success
of this approach using techniques such as CRFs to improve accu-
racy [35], changing the loss from regression to classification [5],
using other more robust loss functions [33], and incorporating
strong scene priors in the case of the related problem of surface
normal estimation [50]. Again, like the previous stereo methods,
these approaches rely on having high quality, pixel aligned,
ground truth depth at training time. We too perform single
depth image estimation, but train with an added binocular color
image, instead of requiring ground truth depth.

Unsupervised Depth Estimation

Recently, a small number of deep network based methods for
novel view synthesis and depth estimation have been proposed,
which do not require ground truth depth at training time. Flynn et
al. [13] introduced a novel image synthesis network called Deep-
Stereo that generates new views by selecting pixels from nearby
images. During training, the relative pose of multiple cameras
is used to predict the appearance of a held-out nearby image.
Then the most appropriate depths are selected to sample colors
from the neighboring images, based on plane sweep volumes.

At test time, image synthesis is performed on small overlapping
patches. As it requires several nearby posed images at test time
DeepStereo is not suitable for monocular depth estimation.

The Deep3D network of Xie et al. [53] also addresses the
problem of novel view synthesis, where their goal is to generate
the corresponding right view from an input left image (i.e. the
source image) in the context of binocular pairs. Again using an
image reconstruction loss, their method produces a distribution
over all the possible disparities for each pixel. The resulting
synthesized right image pixel values are a combination of the
pixels on the same scan line from the left image, weighted
by the probability of each disparity. The disadvantage of
their image formation model is that increasing the number
of candidate disparity values greatly increases the memory
consumption of the algorithm, making it difficult to scale their
approach to bigger output resolutions. In this work, we perform
a comparison to the Deep3D image formation model, and show
that our algorithm produces superior results.

Closest to our model in spirit is the concurrent work of
Garg et al. [16]. Like Deep3D and our method, they train
a network for monocular depth estimation using an image
reconstruction loss. However, their image formation model is
not fully differentiable. To compensate, they perform a Taylor
approximation to linearize their loss resulting in an objective
that is more challenging to optimize. Similar to other recent
work, e.g. [43, 56, 57], our model overcomes this problem by
using bilinear sampling [27] to generate images, resulting in
a fully (sub-)differentiable training loss.

We propose a fully convolutional deep neural network
loosely inspired by the supervised DispNet architecture of
Mayer et al. [39]. By posing monocular depth estimation
as an image reconstruction problem, we can solve for the
disparity field without requiring ground truth depth. However,
only minimizing a photometric loss can result in good quality
image reconstructions but poor quality depth. Among other
terms, our fully differentiable training loss includes a left-right
consistency check to improve the quality of our synthesized
depth images. This type of consistency check is commonly
used as a post-processing step in many stereo methods, e.g.
[54], but we incorporate it directly into our network.

3. Method

This section describes our single image depth prediction
network. We introduce a novel depth estimation training loss,
featuring an inbuilt left-right consistency check, which enables
us to train on image pairs without requiring supervision in the
form of ground truth depth.

3.1. Depth Estimation as Image Reconstruction

Given a single image I at test time, our goal is to learn a
function f that can predict the per-pixel scene depth, ˆd=f(I).
Most existing learning based approaches treat this as a
supervised learning problem, where they have color input

Figure 2. Our loss module outputs left and right disparity maps, dl
and dr. The loss combines smoothness, reconstruction, and left-right
disparity consistency terms. This same module is repeated at each of
the four different output scales. C: Convolution, UC: Up-Convolution,

images and their corresponding target depth values at training. It
is presently not practical to acquire such ground truth depth data
for a large variety of scenes. Even expensive hardware, such
as laser scanners, can be imprecise in natural scenes featuring
movement and reflections. As an alternative, we instead pose
depth estimation as an image reconstruction problem during
training. The intuition here is that, given a calibrated pair of
binocular cameras, if we can learn a function that is able to
reconstruct one image from the other, then we have learned
something about the 3D shape of the scene that is being imaged.
Specifically, at training time, we have access to two images
Il and Ir, corresponding to the left and right color images from
a calibrated stereo pair, captured at the same moment in time.
Instead of trying to directly predict the depth, we attempt to
find the dense correspondence field dr that, when applied to the
left image, would enable us to reconstruct the right image. We
will refer to the reconstructed image Il(dr) as ˜Ir. Similarly, we
can also estimate the left image given the right one, ˜Il =Ir(dl).
Assuming that the images are rectified [19], d corresponds to
the image disparity - a scalar value per pixel that our model
will learn to predict. Given the baseline distance b between the
cameras and the camera focal length f, we can then trivially
recover the depth ˆd from the predicted disparity, ˆd=bf/d.

3.2. Depth Estimation Network

At a high level, our network estimates depth by inferring
the disparities that warp the left image to match the right one.
The key insight of our method is that we can simultaneously
infer both disparities (left-to-right and right-to-left), using only
the left input image, and obtain better depths by enforcing them
to be consistent with each other.

Our network generates the predicted image with backward
mapping using a bilinear sampler, resulting in a fully differen-
tiable image formation model. As illustrated in Fig. 3, na¨ıvely
learning to generate the right image by sampling from the left

smooth disparities, and Clr prefers the predicted left and right
disparities to be consistent. Each of the main terms contains
both a left and a right image variant, but only the left image
is fed through the convolutional layers.

Next, we present each component of our loss in terms of the

ap). The right image versions, e.g. Cr

Appearance Matching Loss During training, the network
learns to generate an image by sampling pixels from the
opposite stereo image. Our image formation model uses the
image sampler from the spatial transformer network (STN) [27]
to sample the input image using a disparity map. The STN uses
bilinear sampling where the output pixel is the weighted sum of
four input pixels. In contrast to alternative approaches [16, 53],
the bilinear sampler used is locally fully differentiable and
integrates seamlessly into our fully convolutional architecture.
This means that we do not require any simplification or
approximation of our cost function.

Inspired by [55], we use a combination of an L1 and
single scale SSIM [51] term as our photometric image
reconstruction cost Cap, which compares the input image Il

Disparity Smoothness Loss We encourage disparities to be

Left-Right Disparity Consistency Loss To produce more
accurate disparity maps, we train our network to predict both
the left and right image disparities, while only being given
the left view as input to the convolutional part of the network.
To ensure coherence, we introduce an L1 left-right disparity
consistency penalty as part of our model. This cost attempts
to make the left-view disparity map be equal to the projected

Our approach uses the left image to produce disparities for both

one will produce disparities aligned with the right image (target).
However, we want the output disparity map to align with the
input left image, meaning the network has to sample from the
right image. We could instead train the network to generate the
left view by sampling from the right image, thus creating a left
view aligned disparity map (No LR in Fig. 3). While this alone
works, the inferred disparities exhibit ‘texture-copy’ artifacts and
errors at depth discontinuities as seen in Fig. 5. We solve this by
training the network to predict the disparity maps for both views
by sampling from the opposite input images. This still only
requires a single left image as input to the convolutional layers
and the right image is only used during training (Ours in Fig. 3).
Enforcing consistency between both disparity maps using this
novel left-right consistency cost leads to more accurate results.
Our fully convolutional architecture is inspired by Disp-
Net [39], but features several important modifications that
enable us to train without requiring ground truth depth. Our net-
work, is composed of two main parts - an encoder (from cnv1 to
cnv7b) and decoder (from upcnv7), please see the supplementary
material for a detailed description. The decoder uses skip con-
nections [47] from the encoder’s activation blocks, enabling it to
resolve higher resolution details. We output disparity predictions
at four different scales (disp4 to disp1), which double in spatial
resolution at each of the subsequent scales. Even though it only
takes a single image as input, our network predicts two disparity
maps at each output scale - left-to-right and right-to-left.

Table 1. Comparison of different image formation models. Results on the KITTI 2015 stereo 200 training set disparity images [17]. For training,
K is the KITTI dataset [17] and CS is Cityscapes [8]. Our model with left-right consistency performs the best, and is further improved with the
addition of the Cityscapes data. The last row shows the result of our model trained and tested with two input images instead of one (see Sec. 4.3).

At test time, our network predicts the disparity at the finest
scale level for the left image dl, which has the same resolution
as the input image. Using the known camera baseline and focal
length from the training set, we then convert from the disparity
map to a depth map. While we also estimate the right disparity
dr during training, it is not used at test time.

4. Results

Here we compare the performance of our approach to both
supervised and unsupervised single view depth estimation
methods. We train on rectified stereo image pairs, and do
not require any supervision in the form of ground truth depth.
Existing single image datasets, such as [41, 45], that lack
stereo pairs, are not suitable for evaluation. Instead we evaluate
our approach using the popular KITTI 2015 [17] dataset. To
evaluate our image formation model, we compare to a variant
of our algorithm that uses the original Deep3D [53] image
formation model and a modified one, Deep3Ds, with an added
smoothness constraint. We also evaluate our approach with and
without the left-right consistency constraint.

4.1. Implementation Details

×

The network which is implemented in TensorFlow [1] con-
tains 31 million trainable parameters, and takes on the order of
25 hours to train using a single Titan X GPU on a dataset of 30
thousand images for 50 epochs. Inference is fast and takes less
than 35 ms, or more than 28 frames per second, for a 512
256
image, including transfer times to and from the GPU. Please
see the supplementary material and our code1 for more details.
During optimization, we set the weighting of the different
loss components to αap = 1 and αlr = 1. The possible output
disparities are constrained to be between 0 and dmax using a
scaled sigmoid non-linearity, where dmax = 0.3
the image
width at a given output scale. As a result of our multi-scale
output, the typical disparity of neighboring pixels will differ
by a factor of two between each scale (as we are upsampling
the output by a factor of two). To correct for this, we scale the
disparity smoothness term αds with r for each scale to get equiv-
alent smoothing at each level. Thus αds =0.1/r, where r is the

downscaling factor of the corresponding layer with respect to
the resolution of the input image that is passed into the network.
For the non-linearities in the network, we used exponential
linear units [7] instead of the commonly used rectified liner units
(ReLU) [40]. We found that ReLUs tended to prematurely fix
the predicted disparities at intermediate scales to a single value,
making subsequent improvement difficult. Following [42],
we replaced the usual deconvolutions with a nearest neighbor
upsampling followed by a convolutions. We trained our model
from scratch for 50 epochs, with a batch size of 8 using Adam
8. We used an
[30], where β1 = 0.9, β2 = 0.999, and (cid:15) = 10−
4 which we kept constant for the
initial learning rate of λ=10−
first 30 epochs before halving it every 10 epochs until the end.
We initially experimented with progressive update schedules,
as in [39], where lower resolution image scales were optimized
first. However, we found that optimizing all four scales at once
led to more stable convergence. Similarly, we use an identical
weighting for the loss of each scale as we found that weighting
them differently led to unstable convergence. We experimented
with batch normalization [26], but found that it did not produce
a significant improvement, and ultimately excluded it.

Data augmentation is performed on the fly. We flip the input
images horizontally with a 50% chance, taking care to also
swap both images so they are in the correct position relative
to each other. We also added color augmentations, with a
50% chance, where we performed random gamma, brightness,
and color shifts by sampling from uniform distributions in
the ranges [0.8,1.2] for gamma, [0.5,2.0] for brightness, and
[0.8,1.2] for each color channel separately.

Resnet50 For the sake of completeness, and similar to [33],
we also show a variant of our model using Resnet50 [20] as
the encoder, the rest of the architecture, parameters and training
procedure staying identical. This variant contains 48 million
trainable parameters and is indicated by resnet in result tables.

Post-processing In order to reduce the effect of stereo disoc-
clusions which create disparity ramps on both the left side of the
image and of the occluders, a final post-processing step is per-
formed on the output. For an input image I at test time, we also

compute the disparity map d(cid:48)l for its horizontally flipped image
I(cid:48). By flipping back this disparity map we obtain a disparity
map d(cid:48)(cid:48)l , which aligns with dl but where the disparity ramps are
located on the right of occluders as well as on the right side of the
image. We combine both disparity maps to form the final result
by assigning the first 5% on the left of the image using d(cid:48)(cid:48)l and
the last 5% on the right to the disparities from dl. The central
part of the final disparity map is the average of dl and d(cid:48)l. This
final post-processing step leads to both better accuracy and less
visual artifacts at the expense of doubling the amount of test time
computation. We indicate such results using pp in result tables.

4.2. KITTI

We present results for the KITTI dataset [17] using two
different test splits, to enable comparison to existing works. In its
raw form, the dataset contains 42,382 rectified stereo pairs from
375 pixels in size.
61 scenes, with a typical image being 1242

×

KITTI Split First we compare different variants of our
method including different image formation models and differ-
ent training sets. We evaluate on the 200 high quality disparity
images provided as part of the official KITTI training set, which
covers a total of 28 scenes. The remaining 33 scenes contain
30,159 images from which we keep 29,000 for training and the
rest for evaluation. While these disparity images are much better
quality than the reprojected velodyne laser depth values, they
have CAD models inserted in place of moving cars. These CAD
models result in ambiguous disparity values on transparent
surfaces such as car windows, and issues at object boundaries
where the CAD models do not perfectly align with the images.
In addition, the maximum depth present in the KITTI dataset is
on the order of 80 meters, and we cap the maximum predictions
of all networks to this value. Results are computed using the
depth metrics from [10] along with the D1-all disparity error
from KITTI [17]. The metrics from [10] measure error in both
meters from the ground truth and the percentage of depths that
are within some threshold from the correct value. It is important
to note that measuring the error in depth space while the ground
truth is given in disparities leads to precision issues. In particular,
the non-thresholded measures can be sensitive to the large errors
in depth caused by prediction errors at small disparity values.

In Table 1, we see that in addition to having poor scaling prop-

erties (in terms of both resolution and the number of disparities it
can represent), when trained from scratch with the same network
architecture as ours, the Deep3D [53] image formation model
performs poorly. From Fig. 6 we can see that Deep3D produces
plausible image reconstructions but the output disparities are in-
ferior to ours. Our loss outperforms both the Deep3D baselines
and the addition of the left-right consistency check increases per-
formance in all measures. In Fig. 5 we illustrate some zoomed
in comparisons, clearly showing that the inclusion of the left-
right check improves the visual quality of the results. Our results
are further improved by first pre-training our model with addi-
tional training data from the Cityscapes dataset [8] containing
22,973 training stereo pairs captured in various cities across Ger-
many. This dataset brings higher resolution, image quality, and
variety compared to KITTI, while having a similar setting. We
cropped the input images to only keep the top 80% of the image,
removing the very reflective car hoods from the input. Interest-
ingly, our model trained on Cityscapes alone does not perform
very well numerically. This is likely due to the difference in
camera calibration between the two datasets, but there is a clear
advantage to fine-tuning on data that is related to the test set.

Eigen Split To be able to compare to existing work, we also
use the test split of 697 images as proposed by [10] which
covers a total of 29 scenes. The remaining 32 scenes contain
23,488 images from which we keep 22,600 for training and the
rest for evaluation, similarly to [16]. To generate the ground
truth depth images, we reproject the 3D points viewed from the
velodyne laser into the left input color camera. Aside from only
producing depth values for less than 5% of the pixels in the
input image, errors are also introduced because of the rotation

of the Velodyne, the motion of the vehicle and surrounding
objects, and also incorrect depth readings due to occlusion at
object boundaries. To be fair to all methods, we use the same
crop as [10] and evaluate at the input image resolution. With the
exception of Garg et al.’s [16] results, the results of the baseline
methods are recomputed by us given the authors’s original
predictions to ensure that all the scores are directly comparable.
This produces slightly different numbers than the previously
published ones, e.g. in the case of [10], their predictions were
evaluated on much smaller depth images (1/4 the original size).
For all baseline methods we use bilinear interpolation to resize
the predictions to the correct input image size.

Table 2 shows quantitative results with some example
outputs shown in Fig. 4. We see that our algorithm outperforms
all other existing methods, including those that are trained with
ground truth depth data. We again see that pre-training on the
Cityscapes dataset improves the results over using KITTI alone.

4.3. Stereo

We also implemented a stereo version of our model, see
Fig. 8, where the network’s input is the concatenation of both
left and right views. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the stereo models
outperforms our monocular network on every single metric,
especially on the D1-all disparity measure, as can be seen
in Table 1. This model was only trained for 12 epochs as it
becomes unstable if trained for longer.

4.4. Make3D

To illustrate that our method can generalize to other datasets,
here we compare to several fully supervised methods on the
Make3D test set of [45]. Make3D consists of only RGB/Depth
pairs and no stereo images, thus our method cannot train on this
data. We use our network trained only on the Cityscapes dataset
and despite the dissimilarities in the datasets, both in content
and camera parameters, we still achieve reasonable results,
even beating [28] on one metric and [37] on three. Due to the
different aspect ratio of the Make3D dataset we evaluate on a
central crop of the images. In Table 3, we compare our output to
the similarly cropped results of the other methods. As in the case
of the KITTI dataset, these results would likely be improved
with more relevant training data. A qualitative comparison to
some of the related methods is shown in Fig. 7. While our
numerical results are not as good as the baselines, qualitatively,
we compare favorably to the supervised competition.

4.5. Generalizing to Other Datasets

Finally, we illustrate some further examples of our model
generalizing to other datasets in Figure 9. Using the model only

produces visually plausible depths. We also captured a 60,000
frame dataset, at 10 frames per second, taken in an urban
environment with a wide angle consumer 1080p stereo camera.
Finetuning the Cityscapes pre-trained model on this dataset
produces visually convincing depth images for a test set that
was captured with the same camera on a different day, please
see the video in the supplementary material for more results.

4.6. Limitations

Even though both our left-right consistency check and post-
processing improve the quality of the results, there are still some
artifacts visible at occlusion boundaries due to the pixels in the
occlusion region not being visible in both images. Explicitly rea-
soning about occlusion during training [23, 25] could improve
these issues. It is worth noting that depending how large the base-
line between the camera and the depth sensor, fully supervised
approaches also do not always have valid depth for all pixels.

Our method requires rectified and temporally aligned
stereo pairs during training, which means that it is currently
not possible to use existing single-view datasets for training
purposes e.g. [41]. However, it is possible to fine-tune our
model on application specific ground truth depth data.

Finally, our method mainly relies on the image reconstruc-
tion term, meaning that specular [18] and transparent surfaces
will produce inconsistent depths. This could be improved with
more sophisticated similarity measures [54].

5. Conclusion

We have presented an unsupervised deep neural network for
single image depth estimation. Instead of using aligned ground
truth depth data, which is both rare and costly, we exploit the
ease with which binocular stereo data can be captured. Our
novel loss function enforces consistency between the predicted
depth maps from each camera view during training, improving
predictions. Our results are superior to fully supervised
baselines, which is encouraging for future research that does
not require expensive to capture ground truth depth. We have
also shown that our model can generalize to unseen datasets
and still produce visually plausible depth maps.

In future work, we would like to extend our model to
videos. While our current depth estimates are performed
independently per frame, adding temporal consistency [28]
would likely improve results. It would also be interesting to
investigate sparse input as an alternative training signal [58, 6].
Finally, while our model estimates per pixel depth, it would be
interesting to also predict the full occupancy of the scene [11].
