Abstract

We introduce a new problem of gaze anticipation on e-
gocentric videos. This substantially extends the convention-
al gaze prediction problem to future frames by no longer
conﬁning it on the current frame. To solve this problem, we
propose a new generative adversarial neural network based
model, Deep Future Gaze (DFG). DFG generates multiple
future frames conditioned on the single current frame and
anticipates corresponding future gazes in next few second-
s. It consists of two networks: generator and discriminator.
The generator uses a two-stream spatial temporal convolu-
tion architecture (3D-CNN) explicitly untangling the fore-
ground and the background to generate future frames.
It
then attaches another 3D-CNN for gaze anticipation based
on these synthetic frames. The discriminator plays against
the generator by differentiating the synthetic frames of the
generator from the real frames. Through competition with
discriminator, the generator progressively improves quality
of the future frames and thus anticipates future gaze better.
Experimental results on the publicly available egocentric
datasets show that DFG signiﬁcantly outperforms all well-
established baselines. Moreover, we demonstrate that DFG
achieves better performance of gaze prediction on current
frames than state-of-the-art methods. This is due to beneﬁt-
ing from learning motion discriminative representations in
frame generation. We further contribute a new egocentric
dataset (OST) in the object search task. DFG also achieves
the best performance for this challenging dataset.

1. Introduction

Egocentric video analysis [2], i.e. analyzing videos cap-
tured from the ﬁrst person perspective, is an emerging ﬁeld
in computer vision which can beneﬁt many applications,
such as virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR).

Figure 1. Problem illustration: gaze anticipation on future frames
within a few seconds on egocentric videos. Given the current
frame, the task is to predict the future gaze locations. Our pro-
posed DFG method solves this problem through synthesizing fu-
ture frames (transparent ones) and predicting corresponding future
gaze locations (red circles).

One of the key components in egocentric video analysis is
gaze prediction — the process of predicting the point of
gaze (where human is ﬁxating) in the head-centered coordi-
nate system. Extending the gaze prediction problem to go
beyond the current frame [37, 25], our paper presents the
new and important problem of gaze anticipation: the pre-
diction of gaze in future1 frames of egocentric videos and
proposes a promising solution.

Gaze anticipation enables the predictive computation
and is useful in many applications, such as human-machine
interaction [39, 9, 32], attention-driver user interface [22]
and interactive advertisements [29]. For example, VR head-
sets, as one category of egocentric devices, require high
computation power and fast speed for synthesizing virtual
realities upon interaction from users [28, 8]. As gaze infor-
mation reﬂects human intent and goal inferences [16, 38],
gaze anticipation facilitates the computation-demanding
systems to plan ahead on VR rendering with increased
buffer time [39]. Thus, pre-rendering of the virtual scenes

based on anticipated gaze locations within the next few sec-
onds provides smoother transitions in virtual reality and
hence better user experience [28, 8].

We tackle gaze anticipation problem in two steps. Given
the current frame, our proposed model, Deep Future Gaze
(DFG), ﬁrst generates future frames and then predicts the
gaze locations on these frames.

As the dense optical ﬂow between adjacent frames does
not prorogate well to subsequent frames [27], we propose a
generative adversarial network (GAN) based model for fu-
ture frame generation through a competition between a gen-
erator (GN) and a discriminator (D) [27, 36]. Future frame
generation of egocentric videos is a challenging task. Com-
pared with the third-person videos where the background is
often static, egocentric videos also involve complex back-
ground motion due to the head movements. We use a two-
stream spatial-temporal convolution architecture (3D-CNN)
in GN to explicitly untangle the foreground and the back-
ground motion. In the video generation approach [27], the
aim is to generate “real” videos with the random noise as
the input. Different from them, we have an additional con-
straint that our generated frames have to be based upon the
input frame. Thus, we attach a 2D convolutional network
(2D-CNN) before the GN to extract the latent representa-
tion of the current frame such that the motion dynamics of
the generated frames is consistent with the current frame
across time. Egocentric vision in a natural environment is
a complex coordination process among head motion, gaze
prediction, and body poses [23]. DFG learns automatically
to model this coordination in GN without explicitly deﬁn-
ing egocentric cues, such as hands, objects and task infor-
mation. The rich information including egocentric motion
dynamics on the generated future frames can then be useful
for gaze anticipation.

D plays against GN by differentiating the synthetic
frames of GN from the real frames. Through competition
with D, GN progressively improves quality of the future
frames based on the feedbacks from D and thus anticipates
future gazes better.

Evaluations of DFG on public egocentric datasets show
that DFG boosts up the performance of gaze anticipation to
a signiﬁcant extent surpassing all the well-established base-
lines. Additionally, DFG demonstrates its capacity of gen-
eralizing to the object search task on our new egocentric
dataset (OST). OST is one of the largest egocentric datasets
in the object search task with eyetracking information avail-
able to our best knowledge.

In summary, our paper has the following contributions:

• We introduce a new and important problem of gaze an-

ticipation on egocentric videos.

• In order to tackle this new problem, we propose a new
GAN-based model. A novel two-stream 3D-CNN is

developed to explicitly untangle foreground and back-
ground motions in egocentric videos.

• Instead of handcrafting egocentric cues, such as hands
and objects, our model automatically learns these cues
during end-to-end training.

• We provide a new egocentric dataset downloadable at
our website2. It is one of the largest in the object search
task with eye-tracking information available.

2. Related Work

In this section, we review important works related to
computational models of visual attention and gaze predic-
tion on egocentric videos in particular.

2.1. Saliency Prediction

Computational saliency models are based on feature-
integration theory [35] where low-level features, such as
color, contrast and intensity, are combined. The ﬁrst models
were developed by Koch et al. [21] and Itti et al. [19]. Sub-
sequent works [13, 41, 7, 14] further improve saliency map
predictions via various methods such as graph-based salien-
cy model [13] and boolean map based saliency [40]. The
most recent saliency models leverage rich pools of seman-
tic regions or objects in the scene from deep convolutional
neural network [17, 26], whereas they focus on saliency pre-
diction on static images and the motion information across
frames has been discarded.

There are a few works exploiting top-down mechanisms.
In [33], the contextual information from the scene was inte-
grated with low-level features for saliency prediction. Borji
et al. [3] explored a direct mapping from motor actions and
low-level features to ﬁxation locations in the driving simu-
lation scenario where motor actions are from the top-down
stream.
In these cases, additional information other than
egocentric videos is required.

2.2. Gaze Prediction on Egocentric Videos

Ba et al. [1] proposed to analyze human visual attention
by exploring correlations between head orientation and gaze
direction. Similarly, Yamada et al. [37] presented gaze pre-
diction models and explored the correlation between gaze
and head motion with the aid of external motion sensors.
However, motion sensors may increase the loads and power
consumption of wearable devices. The most recent mod-
el on gaze prediction in hand-object manipulation tasks was
proposed by Yin et al. [25]. Hand detection and pose recog-
nition provide primary egocentric cues in their model. Since
egocentric cues are predeﬁned, their model may not gener-
alize well to various egocentric activities especially when
hands are not involved.

To the best of our knowledge, we are the ﬁrst to tackle
gaze anticipation problem on egocentric videos. We pro-
pose a novel GAN-based model which can learn essential
egocentric cues automatically during the training phase. D-
ifferent from third person videos, head motion results in
moving background in egocentric videos. Thus, we adapt
the two-stream video model [31, 36] with both streams re-
placed by 3D-CNN to explicitly untangle foreground and
background motions.

3. Our Model

In this section, we ﬁrst introduce an overview of our pro-
posed model, Deep Future Gaze (DFG), and then give the
detailed analysis of its architecture. We provide the training
and implementation details in the end.

3.1. Architecture Overview

Given the current frame as the input, we aim to output a
sequence of anticipated gaze locations in the next few sec-
onds. To address this challenging problem, we propose a
generative adversarial networks (GAN) [27, 36] based mod-
el, to generate future frames and then to predict their corre-
sponding temporal saliency maps, i.e., spatial probabilistic
maps of gaze locations across time where the spatial co-
ordinates with the maximum probability are output as the
anticipated gaze locations. DFG consists of two network-
s: the Generator Network (GN) and the Discriminator Net-
work (D) as shown in Figure 2. In GN, there are two mod-
ules: Future Frame Generation Module (G) and Tempo-
ral Saliency Prediction Module (GP). See Supplementary
Material for architecture details.

3.2. The Generator Network (GN)

The goal of GN is to produce a sequence of N subse-
quent frames It+1,t+N from a latent representation h(It) of
the current frame It in G and N temporal saliency maps
St+1,t+N from It+1,t+N in GP. Here the latent representa-
tion h(It) is learned from a 2D-CNN. In order to identify
the foreground motions (hands and objects) out of the com-
plex background motion due to the head movements, we
propose a two-stream generator architecture. To avoid the
error in the frame generation accumulating from one frame
to another, G is designed to generate a sequence of N fu-
ture frames at once instead of a system where the generated
frame It+1 is fed back as the input to generate the subse-
quent frame It+2. The number of predicted frames N is
application dependent. We select 32 frames or about 2.5
seconds as we believe such duration is adequate for practi-
cal applications. The complete analysis regarding the per-
formance of our model versus number of output frames is
presented in Section 4.6.

We use 3D-CNN in two streams for learning motion rep-
resentations. Meanwhile, fractionally strided convolution

layers (upsampling layers) are added after the convolution
to preserve proper spatial and temporal resolution for the
output frame sequence. The equation for generating the se-
quence of N predicted frames It+1,t+N is

It+1,t+N =F (h(It)) ⊙ M (h(It))

+ (1 − M (h(It))) ⊙ B(h(It)),

(1)

where ⊙ is the elementwise-multiplication operation, F (·)
represents the foreground generation model and B(·) repre-
sents the background generation model. M (·) is a spatial-
temporal mask untangling foreground and background mo-
tion where its pixel value ranges from [0, 1]. In particular,
1 indicates foreground and 0 indicates background. Both
F (·) and B(·) generate a sequence of N predicted RGB-
colored frames, each frame with dimension 3 × W × H
where W and H are the width and the height of the pre-
dicted frame respectively. Foregrounds and backgrounds of
predicted frames get merged by masks M (·) of dimension
N ×1×W ×H replicated across 3 color channels to produce
It+1,t+N . The foreground, background and mask models
are parameterized by 3D-CNN. The foreground model and
the mask model share the same weights until the last layer
which has two branches, one for foreground generation for
N frames with 3 color channels and one for the mask gen-
eration for N frames with single channels. The background
generation model employs another separate 3D-CNN.

As the rich information including the learnt egocen-
tric motion dynamics on the generated future frames is
useful for visual attention in egocentric videos, we adopt
these features for gaze anticipation. Thus, G is followed
by GP to generate temporal saliency maps of dimension
N × 1 × W × H.

3.3. The Discriminator Network (D)

Generating N frames implies the need of a large number
of pixels. This is an extremely difﬁcult task when only a
single frame is given. To enhance the quality of generated
frames, DFG employs D as a competitor to G, by providing
the additional feedbacks to G [27, 36].

D aims to distinguish the synthetic examples from the
real ones. There are two criteria for the synthetic frames to
be “real”: ﬁrst, the semantics from the scene are coherent
across space (e.g. no table surface inside the refrigerator);
second, the motions from both the foreground and the back-
ground are consistent across time (e.g. hand movements
have to be smooth). Thus, D follows the same architecture
as the foreground generation model other than replacing al-
l the upsampling layers with the convolution layers as de-
tailed in Supplementary Material and this architecture has
also been shown to be effective in [36]. The output is a bi-
nary label indicating whether the input frame is fake or real.

Figure 2. Architecture of our proposed Deep Future Gaze (DFG) model. It contains Generator Network and Discriminator Network. In
Future Frame Generation Module of Generator Network, latent representation of the current frame It is extracted by 2D ConvNet. To
explicitly untangle foreground and background, it then branches into two streams: one for learning the representation for the foreground
and the mask; one for learning the representation of the background. These 3 streams are combined to generate future frames (blue
boundaries). Based on the generated frames, Temporal Saliency Prediction Module predicts the anticipated gaze location (red dots). As
a competitor to the generator, Discriminator Network uses a 3D ConvNet to distinguish the generated frames from real frames Rt,t+N
(black boundaries) by classifying its inputs to real or fake.

3.4. Training and Implementation Details

Training We train DFG end-to-end by stochastic gradi-
ent descent with learning rate 0.00005 and momentum 0.5.
Adam Optimizer [20] is used. G and D play against each
other. G is designed to predict future frames as “real” as
possible to fool D, while D strives to tell real frames from
the generated ones. These two networks try to minimize
the maximum payoff of its opponent with respect to their
network parameters wD and wG respectively. In addition,
we add another L1 loss term to ensure that the ﬁrst gener-
ated video frame is visually consistent with the input frame
without the over-smoothing artifacts. A hyper-parameter λ
is used for tuning the weight of losses between the min-max
game and the consistency term. Both networks are trained
alternatively. The objective function for D is

fD(Rt:t+N , h) , Lce(D(Rt:t+N ; wD), 1)

min
wD

(2)

+Lce(D(G(h; wG)), 0),

where h denotes the hidden representation h(It) of input
frame It, Rt:t+N represents the real frames and the binary
cross entropy loss Lce is deﬁned as

Lce( ˆY , Y ) = Y log( ˆY ) + (1 − Y ) log(1 − ˆY ),

(3)

where Y ∈ {0, 1} denotes real or fake and ˆY ∈ [0, 1] de-
notes the output from D.

As the opponent of D, G needs to satisfy two require-
ments: 1) the generated outputs should be real enough to
fool D; 2) the initial output of the generated frames should

be visually consistent with the current frame. The objective
function for training G is thus formulated as

fG(It) , Lce(D(G(h; wG)), 1)

min
wG

+ λkIt − G(It; wG)k1,

(4)

where λ is set as 0.1 which shows to achieve the best perfor-
mance in our case. k · k1 denoting L1 distance is preferred
over the mean square error which results in over-smoothing
in the frame generation [27].

Meanwhile, GP takes It+1,t+N as input to generate tem-
poral saliency maps. GP is trained in a supervised approach
using Kullback-Leibler divergence (KLD) loss function:

KLD(Pi, Qi) =

Pi(x, y) log

Xx Xy

Pi(x, y)
Qi(x, y) (cid:21)

,

(cid:20)

(5)

where Pi is the temporal ﬁxation map and Qi is the tempo-
ral saliency map for the (t + i)th frame.
Implementation Details DFG is developed based on [36]
in Torch. The source code is available at our website2. We
train everything from zero with the input frame size being
3 × 64 × 64. The batch size is 32. The latent representation
h(It) is of dimension 1024 × 4 × 4 after 5 layers of 2D
convolution layers for encoding image representation. We
normalize all videos to be within the range [−1, 1].
Gaze prediction on current frame DFG can also be used
for gaze prediction on the current frame. Since G outputs
a sequence of generated frames where the ﬁrst frame must
be consistent with the input frame due to L1 distance loss in

4375

Equation(4), we take the spatial coordinate with the max-
imum probability in the ﬁrst predicted temporal saliency
map as the predicted gaze location on the current frame.

4. Experiments

We test DFG on gaze anticipation as well as gaze pre-
diction over current frames on public datasets using stan-
dard evaluation metrics. To explore whether DFG can be
generalized well for other tasks in egocentric contexts, we
contribute another dataset (OST) in the object search task.
We provide detailed analysis of DFG through ablation s-
tudy and visualization of the learnt convolution ﬁlters. In
the end, we demonstrate our anticipated gazes are useful in
egocentric activity recognition.

4.1. Datasets

GTEA Dataset [11] This dataset contains 17 sequences
on meal preparation tasks performed by 14 subjects. Each
video clip lasts for about 4 minutes with the frame rate 15
fps and frame resolution 480 × 640. The subject is asked to
prepare meals freely. Same as Yin et al. [25], we use videos
1, 4, 6-22 as training set and the rest as test set.

GTEAplus Dataset [25] This dataset consists of 7 meal
preparation activities. There are 5 subjects, each performing
these 7 activities. Each video clip takes 10 to 15 minutes on
average with frame rate 12 fps and frame resolution 960 ×
1280. We do 5-fold cross validation across all 5 subjects
and take their average for evaluation as [25].

Our Dataset in Object Search Tasks (OST) Due to lack
of egocentric datasets with gaze tracking enabled, we con-
tribute this new dataset for the object search task. This
dataset consists of 57 sequences on search and retrieval
tasks performed by 55 subjects. Each video clip lasts for
around 15 minutes with the frame rate 10 fps and frame res-
olution 480 × 640. Each subject is asked to search for a list
of 22 items (including lanyard, laptop, etc.) and move them
to the packing location (dining table). Details about the 22
items are provided in Supplementary Material. See Figure 3
for exemplar frames. We select frames near the packing lo-
cation and use those from videos 1 to 7 as test set and the
rest for training and validation.

To the best of our knowledge, this is one of the largest
egocentric datasets on the object search task with eye-
tracking information available. Compared with GTEA and
GTEAplus, our dataset involves larger head motions and the
human subjects have to walk and look for objects in the
search list with hands appearing less frequently.

4.2. Evaluation Metrics

We use two standard evaluation metrics on gaze anticipa-
tion in egocentric videos: Area Under the Curve (AUC) [4]
and Average Angular Error (AAE) [30] deﬁned as below:

Figure 3. Sample frames from our introduced object search dataset
(OST). It covers various rooms in a fully furnished 2-bedroom a-
partment and includes 22 searching items. For our experiments,
only frames near the packing location (dining table) are selected.

Area Under the Curve (AUC) is the most commonly used
It measures the area under a
saliency evaluation metric.
curve of true positive versus false positive rates under vari-
ous threshold values on saliency maps.

Average Angular Error (AAE) is the angular distance be-
tween the predicted gaze location and the ground truth.

4.3. Baselines

We create several competitive baselines as follows:
First, to show the effectiveness of end-to-end learning
where all the parameters are trained jointly, we use G to
generate future frames after the training phase and compare
DFG with state-of-the-art saliency prediction algorithms on
these frames including Graph-based Visual Saliency (GB-
VS) [13], Natural Statistics Saliency (SUN) [41], Adaptive
Whitening Saliency (AWS) [12], Attention-based Informa-
tion Maximization (AIM) [6], Itti’s Model (Itti) [18], and
Image Signature Saliency (ImSig) [15].

Second, SALICON [17] is a deep learning architecture
for saliency prediction on static images. We train SALI-
CON from scratch on the egocentric datasets by using real
frames and their corresponding ﬁxation maps. After that,
the pre-trained SALICON model is tested on our generated
frames for gaze anticipation.

Third, we create another baseline (OpticalShift) to study
the effect of temporal dynamics. We use our model to pre-
dict gaze on the current frame and compute the dense opti-
cal ﬂow between the previous frame and the current frame
using [5]. The predicted gaze is then warped to the future
frames by shifting it based on the ﬂow at that position as the
future gaze locations.

Fourth, we include the graph-based method to model
gaze transition dynamics as proposed by [25] for gaze pre-
diction on current frames in GTEA and GTEAplus. We ex-
clude this method on OST since the required hand annota-
tions by [25] are not available. We also cannot extend this
method to gaze anticipation problem.

4.4. Results on Gaze Anticipation

DFG surpasses all the competitive baselines signiﬁcant-
ly in gaze anticipation. We report the quantitative evalua-
tion results in Figure 4 (AUC) and 5 (AAE). On all three
datasets, DFG outperforms all the competitive baselines by
31%, 50% and 24% in relative advance (RA) in AAE and
21%, 5% and 3% in RA in AUC with respect to the best
baseline (BB) as shown in Figure 4 and 5. RA in percent-
age is computed as

where N =32 is the number of generated future frames,

ric score of BB on the ith future frame.

Qualitative results in Figure 6 demonstrate that DFG
learns to untangle foreground and background motions. In
the foreground, both the hand and the object (the bun) get
highlighted. As the high intensity value on the mask denotes
the foreground, the manipulation point (the control point
where the subject is manipulating the object with hands)
shows the highest activation on the mask whereas the back-
ground (the table surface) is uniform over time as shown in
the darker regions of the mask.

Though SALICON learns an abundance of semantic in-
formation, it excludes temporal dependencies which are

ahead) based on the current frame. Frames #1, 5, 9, 17, 29 are
shown (left to right columns). The topmost row shows the ground
truth with red circle denoting human gaze locations. Row 2, 3,

ed temporal saliency maps. Best viewed in color.

crucial for gaze anticipation on egocentric videos. Although
SALICON has performed better than conventional salien-
cy prediction methods, its performance is inferior to DFG

4377

which learns spatial-temporal information.

For OpticalShift, we observe that its AUC and AAE
curves drop monotonically. It conﬁrms that the optical ﬂow
computed from the current state cannot adapt to the com-
plexity of the temporal dynamics in longer time periods.

We often observe a strong center bias (CB) in egocen-
tric videos. This is due to the fact that egocentric videos
are captured from the ﬁrst person perspective. Humans al-
ways move their heads to attend to the regions of interest.
In this case, gazes often align with head orientations. Thus,
gaze shift in the large distance gets compensated by head
movements with small gaze shifts. The statistics of ampli-
tudes for head and gaze motions in our test sets for GTEA
and GTEAplus datasets are provided in Supplementary Ma-
terial. To validate DFG predicts more than CB, we ﬁt a
Gaussian mask in the center to generate temporal saliency
maps. As AUC favors CB, we use sAUC to compare our
model with CB and report sAUC scores as: DFG (0.58) and
CB (0.5) in GTEA, DFG (0.61) and CB (0.5) in GTEAplus
as well as DFG (0.56) and CB (0.49) in OST. It conﬁrms
that our model incorporates various egocentric information
and motion dynamics for gaze anticipation rather than CB.
Based on the statistics of the two motions in our testsets, it
also shows that both GP and G are critical for better gaze
anticipation by estimating the two motions separately.

4.5. Results on Current Frame Gaze Prediction

We compare DFG with state-of-the-art saliency predic-
tion algorithms in Section 4.3 on real frames in the testsets
of three datasets and report both AAE and AUC scores of
gaze prediction on current frames in Table 1. Results show
that DFG performs competitively well or better than the-
state-of-the-arts even without explicitly specifying egocen-
tric cues, such as hands and objects of interest. Moreover,
different from the traditional methods, our model takes the
current frame as the only input without the past informa-
tion. We observe that AAE scores are lower than Yin et al.
[25] on GTEA and this may be due to the small number of
training samples compared with GTEAplus.

4.6. Ablation Study

In order to study the effect of the individual component
of DFG, we do an ablation study and test on GTEA by re-
moving only one component in DFG at one time while the
rest of the architecture remains the same. There are three
tests: (1) we replace the two-stream 3D-CNN in G with the
same structure as [36], i.e. the background stream is “stat-
ic” while the foreground stream remains the same; (2) we
train GP directly on real frames and test GP on the gener-
ated frames from G; (3) we remove D and we only use L1
distance loss for future frame generation. Scores for gaze
anticipation in AAE and AUC are averaged every 8 frames
across 32 frames as shown in Table 2.

Table 2. Ablation Study. From top to bottom, the evaluated models
are: our best, one stream replaced by 2D convolution net; our mod-
el with Future Frame Generation Module removed and ground
truth frames as direct inputs for training and future frames for test-
ing; and the discriminator removed.

The ﬁrst ablation study on changing the background
stream to a static one leads to an increase of 0.7 in AAE.
This implies the two-stream 3D-CNN in G is essential for
learning foreground and background motions which can
further improve gaze anticipation accuracy. The second ab-
lated model with GP trained on real frames performs worse
with an increase of 2 in AAE than DFG. In DFG, GP is
attached after G for temporal saliency map prediction us-
ing end-to-end training. However, GP in the second ablated
model trained only on real frames cannot perform well s-
ince it cannot learn the essential features on the generated

4378

frames. It demonstrates that the features on the generated
frames are different from those on real frames and hence,
end-to-end training is necessary for GP to learn these es-
sential features on the generated frames. The third abla-
tion study with D removed shows an increases of 1 in AAE
from the 17th frame onwards. This demonstrates that D is
important as the feedback to GN which provides the addi-
tional constraints such that G can generate more “realistic”
future frames in longer time duration. These “realistic” fu-
ture frames are critical for gaze anticipation.

Moreover, to study the effectiveness of GAN-based ar-
chitecture, we develop a few more comparative methods.
See Supplementary Material for results and implementa-
tion details. First, we compare DFG with SalDirect: a 3D-
ConvNet directly modeling gaze anticipation. Secondly, we
develop a new model (SalFusion) which averages the tem-
poral saliency maps from both SalDirect and DFG to gen-
erate the ﬁnal temporal saliency maps. Results show DFG
outperforms SalDirect in both AAE and AUC. It suggests
GAN has essential contributions to gaze anticipation. Sal-
Fusion outperforms two composite models which conﬁrm-
s that the learnt motion cue from GANs is important and
complementary to the cues learned directly from SalDirect.
It is also observed that the gaze movement on individual
frames is dependent on their previous states; e.g. to antici-
pate gaze on the frame t+32, we need to consider gaze tran-
sitions across frames by also anticipating gaze on frames t
to t + 31. For veriﬁcation, we created one baseline: train
SALICON model, a 2D-ConvNet, directly for gaze antici-
pation at time t+16 and t+32 using their respective ground
truth at time t + 16 and t + 32. See Supplementary Materi-
al for results. DFG performs much better than SALICON.
This suggests the temporal dependence across frames plays
fundamental roles in gaze anticipation in egocentric videos
and future frame generation using GANs is useful.

In video analysis, the number of consecutive frames is a
key parameter in practice. We study the effect of the number
of frames on gaze anticipation. See Supplementary Material
for implementation and result details. From the results, we
observe that given an input frame, in order to anticipate gaze
on subsequent L frames, models trained with L + K frames
will perform better as K increases. This is because GP can
learn the temporal dynamics with more information ﬂow-
ing back from the future K frames. In the extreme scenario
where L = 1 and K = 0, this architecture will be simpli-
ﬁed as the feedforward 2D-CNN, similar as SALICON, and
hence produces lower gaze anticipation performance.

4.7. Visualization

As GP estimates temporal saliency maps based on the
generated frames, we analyze the learnt convolution ﬁlters
in GP and align the observations with human bottom-up vi-
sual attention mechanism (VA). See Supplementary Materi-

als for implementation details. We observe that the ﬁlters in
the ﬁrst convolution layer of GP learn the low level features,
such as edges and regions of high contrast. This observation
aligns well with VA which is driven by low level features at
the initial stage according to [35]. More interestingly, we
also ﬁnd the learnt features change across time, e.g.
the
black region increases from left to right across time (row 2
in Figure 7a) and the brightness in the bottom regions decay
across time (row 4 in Figure 7a). This demonstrates DFG
learns motion dynamics such as translation and the gradient
change of surfaces. As the level of convolution layers in-
creases, we can see more complex patterns. In the second
last layer, the regions containing semantic information get
activated with some examples shown in Figure 7b. This in-
cludes salient objects, such as the white bowl, the tip of the
milk box, the fonts on the oatmeal box and the bread with
peanut butter. Overall, we infer that DFG not only learns
egocentric cues in the spatial domain but also motion dy-
namics in the temporal domain.

4.8. Gaze aided Egocentric Activity Recognition

Egocentric gaze can help ﬁrst person’s activity recogni-
tion. We adapt the C3D network [34] with integration of
our anticipated gaze locations to egocentric activity recog-
nition. Results show that our gaze-aided model (28.5%) sig-
niﬁcantly surpasses the initial C3D network [34] (26.9%),
STIP [24] (14.9%), Cuboids [10] (22.7%), as well as one
baseline (13.6%) on GTEAplus 3. See Supplementary Ma-
terial for implementation details and results analysis.

5. Conclusion

We present a new challenging gaze anticipation prob-
lem on future frames as an extension of the gaze prediction
problem on current frames on egocentric videos. We de-
velop DFG built upon GAN for solving this problem. We
make great improvements on the existing works of GAN.
To explicitly learn foreground and background motions in
egocentric settings, we propose a two-stream 3D-CNN in
the generator network. The qualitative results show that our
model learns to untangle these motions. We evaluate our
model using standard metrics and our performance surpass-
es all the competitive baselines signiﬁcantly.

Abstract

We introduce a new problem of gaze anticipation on e-
gocentric videos. This substantially extends the convention-
al gaze prediction problem to future frames by no longer
conﬁning it on the current frame. To solve this problem, we
propose a new generative adversarial neural network based
model, Deep Future Gaze (DFG). DFG generates multiple
future frames conditioned on the single current frame and
anticipates corresponding future gazes in next few second-
s. It consists of two networks: generator and discriminator.
The generator uses a two-stream spatial temporal convolu-
tion architecture (3D-CNN) explicitly untangling the fore-
ground and the background to generate future frames.
It
then attaches another 3D-CNN for gaze anticipation based
on these synthetic frames. The discriminator plays against
the generator by differentiating the synthetic frames of the
generator from the real frames. Through competition with
discriminator, the generator progressively improves quality
of the future frames and thus anticipates future gaze better.
Experimental results on the publicly available egocentric
datasets show that DFG signiﬁcantly outperforms all well-
established baselines. Moreover, we demonstrate that DFG
achieves better performance of gaze prediction on current
frames than state-of-the-art methods. This is due to beneﬁt-
ing from learning motion discriminative representations in
frame generation. We further contribute a new egocentric
dataset (OST) in the object search task. DFG also achieves
the best performance for this challenging dataset.

1. Introduction

Egocentric video analysis [2], i.e. analyzing videos cap-
tured from the ﬁrst person perspective, is an emerging ﬁeld
in computer vision which can beneﬁt many applications,
such as virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR).

Figure 1. Problem illustration: gaze anticipation on future frames
within a few seconds on egocentric videos. Given the current
frame, the task is to predict the future gaze locations. Our pro-
posed DFG method solves this problem through synthesizing fu-
ture frames (transparent ones) and predicting corresponding future
gaze locations (red circles).

One of the key components in egocentric video analysis is
gaze prediction — the process of predicting the point of
gaze (where human is ﬁxating) in the head-centered coordi-
nate system. Extending the gaze prediction problem to go
beyond the current frame [37, 25], our paper presents the
new and important problem of gaze anticipation: the pre-
diction of gaze in future1 frames of egocentric videos and
proposes a promising solution.

Gaze anticipation enables the predictive computation
and is useful in many applications, such as human-machine
interaction [39, 9, 32], attention-driver user interface [22]
and interactive advertisements [29]. For example, VR head-
sets, as one category of egocentric devices, require high
computation power and fast speed for synthesizing virtual
realities upon interaction from users [28, 8]. As gaze infor-
mation reﬂects human intent and goal inferences [16, 38],
gaze anticipation facilitates the computation-demanding
systems to plan ahead on VR rendering with increased
buffer time [39]. Thus, pre-rendering of the virtual scenes

1By “future” we mean within a few seconds.

based on anticipated gaze locations within the next few sec-
onds provides smoother transitions in virtual reality and
hence better user experience [28, 8].

We tackle gaze anticipation problem in two steps. Given
the current frame, our proposed model, Deep Future Gaze
(DFG), ﬁrst generates future frames and then predicts the
gaze locations on these frames.

As the dense optical ﬂow between adjacent frames does
not prorogate well to subsequent frames [27], we propose a
generative adversarial network (GAN) based model for fu-
ture frame generation through a competition between a gen-
erator (GN) and a discriminator (D) [27, 36]. Future frame
generation of egocentric videos is a challenging task. Com-
pared with the third-person videos where the background is
often static, egocentric videos also involve complex back-
ground motion due to the head movements. We use a two-
stream spatial-temporal convolution architecture (3D-CNN)
in GN to explicitly untangle the foreground and the back-
ground motion. In the video generation approach [27], the
aim is to generate “real” videos with the random noise as
the input. Different from them, we have an additional con-
straint that our generated frames have to be based upon the
input frame. Thus, we attach a 2D convolutional network
(2D-CNN) before the GN to extract the latent representa-
tion of the current frame such that the motion dynamics of
the generated frames is consistent with the current frame
across time. Egocentric vision in a natural environment is
a complex coordination process among head motion, gaze
prediction, and body poses [23]. DFG learns automatically
to model this coordination in GN without explicitly deﬁn-
ing egocentric cues, such as hands, objects and task infor-
mation. The rich information including egocentric motion
dynamics on the generated future frames can then be useful
for gaze anticipation.

D plays against GN by differentiating the synthetic
frames of GN from the real frames. Through competition
with D, GN progressively improves quality of the future
frames based on the feedbacks from D and thus anticipates
future gazes better.

Evaluations of DFG on public egocentric datasets show
that DFG boosts up the performance of gaze anticipation to
a signiﬁcant extent surpassing all the well-established base-
lines. Additionally, DFG demonstrates its capacity of gen-
eralizing to the object search task on our new egocentric
dataset (OST). OST is one of the largest egocentric datasets
in the object search task with eyetracking information avail-
able to our best knowledge.

In summary, our paper has the following contributions:

• We introduce a new and important problem of gaze an-

ticipation on egocentric videos.

• In order to tackle this new problem, we propose a new
GAN-based model. A novel two-stream 3D-CNN is

developed to explicitly untangle foreground and back-
ground motions in egocentric videos.

• Instead of handcrafting egocentric cues, such as hands
and objects, our model automatically learns these cues
during end-to-end training.

• We provide a new egocentric dataset downloadable at
our website2. It is one of the largest in the object search
task with eye-tracking information available.

2. Related Work

In this section, we review important works related to
computational models of visual attention and gaze predic-
tion on egocentric videos in particular.

2.1. Saliency Prediction

Computational saliency models are based on feature-
integration theory [35] where low-level features, such as
color, contrast and intensity, are combined. The ﬁrst models
were developed by Koch et al. [21] and Itti et al. [19]. Sub-
sequent works [13, 41, 7, 14] further improve saliency map
predictions via various methods such as graph-based salien-
cy model [13] and boolean map based saliency [40]. The
most recent saliency models leverage rich pools of seman-
tic regions or objects in the scene from deep convolutional
neural network [17, 26], whereas they focus on saliency pre-
diction on static images and the motion information across
frames has been discarded.

There are a few works exploiting top-down mechanisms.
In [33], the contextual information from the scene was inte-
grated with low-level features for saliency prediction. Borji
et al. [3] explored a direct mapping from motor actions and
low-level features to ﬁxation locations in the driving simu-
lation scenario where motor actions are from the top-down
stream.
In these cases, additional information other than
egocentric videos is required.

2.2. Gaze Prediction on Egocentric Videos

Ba et al. [1] proposed to analyze human visual attention
by exploring correlations between head orientation and gaze
direction. Similarly, Yamada et al. [37] presented gaze pre-
diction models and explored the correlation between gaze
and head motion with the aid of external motion sensors.
However, motion sensors may increase the loads and power
consumption of wearable devices. The most recent mod-
el on gaze prediction in hand-object manipulation tasks was
proposed by Yin et al. [25]. Hand detection and pose recog-
nition provide primary egocentric cues in their model. Since
egocentric cues are predeﬁned, their model may not gener-
alize well to various egocentric activities especially when
hands are not involved.

To the best of our knowledge, we are the ﬁrst to tackle
gaze anticipation problem on egocentric videos. We pro-
pose a novel GAN-based model which can learn essential
egocentric cues automatically during the training phase. D-
ifferent from third person videos, head motion results in
moving background in egocentric videos. Thus, we adapt
the two-stream video model [31, 36] with both streams re-
placed by 3D-CNN to explicitly untangle foreground and
background motions.

3. Our Model

In this section, we ﬁrst introduce an overview of our pro-
posed model, Deep Future Gaze (DFG), and then give the
detailed analysis of its architecture. We provide the training
and implementation details in the end.

3.1. Architecture Overview

Given the current frame as the input, we aim to output a
sequence of anticipated gaze locations in the next few sec-
onds. To address this challenging problem, we propose a
generative adversarial networks (GAN) [27, 36] based mod-
el, to generate future frames and then to predict their corre-
sponding temporal saliency maps, i.e., spatial probabilistic
maps of gaze locations across time where the spatial co-
ordinates with the maximum probability are output as the
anticipated gaze locations. DFG consists of two network-
s: the Generator Network (GN) and the Discriminator Net-
work (D) as shown in Figure 2. In GN, there are two mod-
ules: Future Frame Generation Module (G) and Tempo-
ral Saliency Prediction Module (GP). See Supplementary
Material for architecture details.

3.2. The Generator Network (GN)

The goal of GN is to produce a sequence of N subse-
quent frames It+1,t+N from a latent representation h(It) of
the current frame It in G and N temporal saliency maps
St+1,t+N from It+1,t+N in GP. Here the latent representa-
tion h(It) is learned from a 2D-CNN. In order to identify
the foreground motions (hands and objects) out of the com-
plex background motion due to the head movements, we
propose a two-stream generator architecture. To avoid the
error in the frame generation accumulating from one frame
to another, G is designed to generate a sequence of N fu-
ture frames at once instead of a system where the generated
frame It+1 is fed back as the input to generate the subse-
quent frame It+2. The number of predicted frames N is
application dependent. We select 32 frames or about 2.5
seconds as we believe such duration is adequate for practi-
cal applications. The complete analysis regarding the per-
formance of our model versus number of output frames is
presented in Section 4.6.

We use 3D-CNN in two streams for learning motion rep-
resentations. Meanwhile, fractionally strided convolution

layers (upsampling layers) are added after the convolution
to preserve proper spatial and temporal resolution for the
output frame sequence. The equation for generating the se-
quence of N predicted frames It+1,t+N is

It+1,t+N =F (h(It)) ⊙ M (h(It))

+ (1 − M (h(It))) ⊙ B(h(It)),

(1)

where ⊙ is the elementwise-multiplication operation, F (·)
represents the foreground generation model and B(·) repre-
sents the background generation model. M (·) is a spatial-
temporal mask untangling foreground and background mo-
tion where its pixel value ranges from [0, 1]. In particular,
1 indicates foreground and 0 indicates background. Both
F (·) and B(·) generate a sequence of N predicted RGB-
colored frames, each frame with dimension 3 × W × H
where W and H are the width and the height of the pre-
dicted frame respectively. Foregrounds and backgrounds of
predicted frames get merged by masks M (·) of dimension
N ×1×W ×H replicated across 3 color channels to produce
It+1,t+N . The foreground, background and mask models
are parameterized by 3D-CNN. The foreground model and
the mask model share the same weights until the last layer
which has two branches, one for foreground generation for
N frames with 3 color channels and one for the mask gen-
eration for N frames with single channels. The background
generation model employs another separate 3D-CNN.

As the rich information including the learnt egocen-
tric motion dynamics on the generated future frames is
useful for visual attention in egocentric videos, we adopt
these features for gaze anticipation. Thus, G is followed
by GP to generate temporal saliency maps of dimension
N × 1 × W × H.

3.3. The Discriminator Network (D)

Generating N frames implies the need of a large number
of pixels. This is an extremely difﬁcult task when only a
single frame is given. To enhance the quality of generated
frames, DFG employs D as a competitor to G, by providing
the additional feedbacks to G [27, 36].

D aims to distinguish the synthetic examples from the
real ones. There are two criteria for the synthetic frames to
be “real”: ﬁrst, the semantics from the scene are coherent
across space (e.g. no table surface inside the refrigerator);
second, the motions from both the foreground and the back-
ground are consistent across time (e.g. hand movements
have to be smooth). Thus, D follows the same architecture
as the foreground generation model other than replacing al-
l the upsampling layers with the convolution layers as de-
tailed in Supplementary Material and this architecture has
also been shown to be effective in [36]. The output is a bi-
nary label indicating whether the input frame is fake or real.

Figure 2. Architecture of our proposed Deep Future Gaze (DFG) model. It contains Generator Network and Discriminator Network. In
Future Frame Generation Module of Generator Network, latent representation of the current frame It is extracted by 2D ConvNet. To
explicitly untangle foreground and background, it then branches into two streams: one for learning the representation for the foreground
and the mask; one for learning the representation of the background. These 3 streams are combined to generate future frames (blue
boundaries). Based on the generated frames, Temporal Saliency Prediction Module predicts the anticipated gaze location (red dots). As
a competitor to the generator, Discriminator Network uses a 3D ConvNet to distinguish the generated frames from real frames Rt,t+N
(black boundaries) by classifying its inputs to real or fake.

3.4. Training and Implementation Details

Training We train DFG end-to-end by stochastic gradi-
ent descent with learning rate 0.00005 and momentum 0.5.
Adam Optimizer [20] is used. G and D play against each
other. G is designed to predict future frames as “real” as
possible to fool D, while D strives to tell real frames from
the generated ones. These two networks try to minimize
the maximum payoff of its opponent with respect to their
network parameters wD and wG respectively. In addition,
we add another L1 loss term to ensure that the ﬁrst gener-
ated video frame is visually consistent with the input frame
without the over-smoothing artifacts. A hyper-parameter λ
is used for tuning the weight of losses between the min-max
game and the consistency term. Both networks are trained
alternatively. The objective function for D is

fD(Rt:t+N , h) , Lce(D(Rt:t+N ; wD), 1)

min
wD

(2)

+Lce(D(G(h; wG)), 0),

where h denotes the hidden representation h(It) of input
frame It, Rt:t+N represents the real frames and the binary
cross entropy loss Lce is deﬁned as

Lce( ˆY , Y ) = Y log( ˆY ) + (1 − Y ) log(1 − ˆY ),

(3)

where Y ∈ {0, 1} denotes real or fake and ˆY ∈ [0, 1] de-
notes the output from D.

As the opponent of D, G needs to satisfy two require-
ments: 1) the generated outputs should be real enough to
fool D; 2) the initial output of the generated frames should

be visually consistent with the current frame. The objective
function for training G is thus formulated as

fG(It) , Lce(D(G(h; wG)), 1)

min
wG

+ λkIt − G(It; wG)k1,

(4)

where λ is set as 0.1 which shows to achieve the best perfor-
mance in our case. k · k1 denoting L1 distance is preferred
over the mean square error which results in over-smoothing
in the frame generation [27].

Meanwhile, GP takes It+1,t+N as input to generate tem-
poral saliency maps. GP is trained in a supervised approach
using Kullback-Leibler divergence (KLD) loss function:

KLD(Pi, Qi) =

Pi(x, y) log

Xx Xy

Pi(x, y)
Qi(x, y) (cid:21)

,

(cid:20)

(5)

where Pi is the temporal ﬁxation map and Qi is the tempo-
ral saliency map for the (t + i)th frame.
Implementation Details DFG is developed based on [36]
in Torch. The source code is available at our website2. We
train everything from zero with the input frame size being
3 × 64 × 64. The batch size is 32. The latent representation
h(It) is of dimension 1024 × 4 × 4 after 5 layers of 2D
convolution layers for encoding image representation. We
normalize all videos to be within the range [−1, 1].
Gaze prediction on current frame DFG can also be used
for gaze prediction on the current frame. Since G outputs
a sequence of generated frames where the ﬁrst frame must
be consistent with the input frame due to L1 distance loss in

4375

Equation(4), we take the spatial coordinate with the max-
imum probability in the ﬁrst predicted temporal saliency
map as the predicted gaze location on the current frame.

4. Experiments

We test DFG on gaze anticipation as well as gaze pre-
diction over current frames on public datasets using stan-
dard evaluation metrics. To explore whether DFG can be
generalized well for other tasks in egocentric contexts, we
contribute another dataset (OST) in the object search task.
We provide detailed analysis of DFG through ablation s-
tudy and visualization of the learnt convolution ﬁlters. In
the end, we demonstrate our anticipated gazes are useful in
egocentric activity recognition.

4.1. Datasets

GTEA Dataset [11] This dataset contains 17 sequences
on meal preparation tasks performed by 14 subjects. Each
video clip lasts for about 4 minutes with the frame rate 15
fps and frame resolution 480 × 640. The subject is asked to
prepare meals freely. Same as Yin et al. [25], we use videos
1, 4, 6-22 as training set and the rest as test set.

GTEAplus Dataset [25] This dataset consists of 7 meal
preparation activities. There are 5 subjects, each performing
these 7 activities. Each video clip takes 10 to 15 minutes on
average with frame rate 12 fps and frame resolution 960 ×
1280. We do 5-fold cross validation across all 5 subjects
and take their average for evaluation as [25].

Our Dataset in Object Search Tasks (OST) Due to lack
of egocentric datasets with gaze tracking enabled, we con-
tribute this new dataset for the object search task. This
dataset consists of 57 sequences on search and retrieval
tasks performed by 55 subjects. Each video clip lasts for
around 15 minutes with the frame rate 10 fps and frame res-
olution 480 × 640. Each subject is asked to search for a list
of 22 items (including lanyard, laptop, etc.) and move them
to the packing location (dining table). Details about the 22
items are provided in Supplementary Material. See Figure 3
for exemplar frames. We select frames near the packing lo-
cation and use those from videos 1 to 7 as test set and the
rest for training and validation.

To the best of our knowledge, this is one of the largest
egocentric datasets on the object search task with eye-
tracking information available. Compared with GTEA and
GTEAplus, our dataset involves larger head motions and the
human subjects have to walk and look for objects in the
search list with hands appearing less frequently.

4.2. Evaluation Metrics

We use two standard evaluation metrics on gaze anticipa-
tion in egocentric videos: Area Under the Curve (AUC) [4]
and Average Angular Error (AAE) [30] deﬁned as below:

Figure 3. Sample frames from our introduced object search dataset
(OST). It covers various rooms in a fully furnished 2-bedroom a-
partment and includes 22 searching items. For our experiments,
only frames near the packing location (dining table) are selected.

Area Under the Curve (AUC) is the most commonly used
It measures the area under a
saliency evaluation metric.
curve of true positive versus false positive rates under vari-
ous threshold values on saliency maps.

Average Angular Error (AAE) is the angular distance be-
tween the predicted gaze location and the ground truth.

4.3. Baselines

We create several competitive baselines as follows:
First, to show the effectiveness of end-to-end learning
where all the parameters are trained jointly, we use G to
generate future frames after the training phase and compare
DFG with state-of-the-art saliency prediction algorithms on
these frames including Graph-based Visual Saliency (GB-
VS) [13], Natural Statistics Saliency (SUN) [41], Adaptive
Whitening Saliency (AWS) [12], Attention-based Informa-
tion Maximization (AIM) [6], Itti’s Model (Itti) [18], and
Image Signature Saliency (ImSig) [15].

Second, SALICON [17] is a deep learning architecture
for saliency prediction on static images. We train SALI-
CON from scratch on the egocentric datasets by using real
frames and their corresponding ﬁxation maps. After that,
the pre-trained SALICON model is tested on our generated
frames for gaze anticipation.

Third, we create another baseline (OpticalShift) to study
the effect of temporal dynamics. We use our model to pre-
dict gaze on the current frame and compute the dense opti-
cal ﬂow between the previous frame and the current frame
using [5]. The predicted gaze is then warped to the future
frames by shifting it based on the ﬂow at that position as the
future gaze locations.

Fourth, we include the graph-based method to model
gaze transition dynamics as proposed by [25] for gaze pre-
diction on current frames in GTEA and GTEAplus. We ex-
clude this method on OST since the required hand annota-
tions by [25] are not available. We also cannot extend this
method to gaze anticipation problem.

4.4. Results on Gaze Anticipation

DFG surpasses all the competitive baselines signiﬁcant-
ly in gaze anticipation. We report the quantitative evalua-
tion results in Figure 4 (AUC) and 5 (AAE). On all three
datasets, DFG outperforms all the competitive baselines by
31%, 50% and 24% in relative advance (RA) in AAE and
21%, 5% and 3% in RA in AUC with respect to the best
baseline (BB) as shown in Figure 4 and 5. RA in percent-
age is computed as

where N =32 is the number of generated future frames,
OURi is the metric score of our model and BBi is the met-
ric score of BB on the ith future frame.

Qualitative results in Figure 6 demonstrate that DFG
learns to untangle foreground and background motions. In
the foreground, both the hand and the object (the bun) get
highlighted. As the high intensity value on the mask denotes
the foreground, the manipulation point (the control point
where the subject is manipulating the object with hands)
shows the highest activation on the mask whereas the back-
ground (the table surface) is uniform over time as shown in
the darker regions of the mask.

Though SALICON learns an abundance of semantic in-
formation, it excludes temporal dependencies which are

dataset. Our DFG model produces 31 future frames (2.67 seconds
ahead) based on the current frame. Frames #1, 5, 9, 17, 29 are
shown (left to right columns). The topmost row shows the ground
truth with red circle denoting human gaze locations. Row 2, 3,
4 show the foreground F (·), the mask M (·), and the background

generated future frames. Row 6 shows the corresponding predict-
ed temporal saliency maps. Best viewed in color.

crucial for gaze anticipation on egocentric videos. Although
SALICON has performed better than conventional salien-
cy prediction methods, its performance is inferior to DFG

4377

which learns spatial-temporal information.

For OpticalShift, we observe that its AUC and AAE
curves drop monotonically. It conﬁrms that the optical ﬂow
computed from the current state cannot adapt to the com-
plexity of the temporal dynamics in longer time periods.

We often observe a strong center bias (CB) in egocen-
tric videos. This is due to the fact that egocentric videos
are captured from the ﬁrst person perspective. Humans al-
ways move their heads to attend to the regions of interest.
In this case, gazes often align with head orientations. Thus,
gaze shift in the large distance gets compensated by head
movements with small gaze shifts. The statistics of ampli-
tudes for head and gaze motions in our test sets for GTEA
and GTEAplus datasets are provided in Supplementary Ma-
terial. To validate DFG predicts more than CB, we ﬁt a
Gaussian mask in the center to generate temporal saliency
maps. As AUC favors CB, we use sAUC to compare our
model with CB and report sAUC scores as: DFG (0.58) and
CB (0.5) in GTEA, DFG (0.61) and CB (0.5) in GTEAplus
as well as DFG (0.56) and CB (0.49) in OST. It conﬁrms
that our model incorporates various egocentric information
and motion dynamics for gaze anticipation rather than CB.
Based on the statistics of the two motions in our testsets, it
also shows that both GP and G are critical for better gaze
anticipation by estimating the two motions separately.

4.5. Results on Current Frame Gaze Prediction

We compare DFG with state-of-the-art saliency predic-
tion algorithms in Section 4.3 on real frames in the testsets
of three datasets and report both AAE and AUC scores of
gaze prediction on current frames in Table 1. Results show
that DFG performs competitively well or better than the-
state-of-the-arts even without explicitly specifying egocen-
tric cues, such as hands and objects of interest. Moreover,
different from the traditional methods, our model takes the
current frame as the only input without the past informa-
tion. We observe that AAE scores are lower than Yin et al.
[25] on GTEA and this may be due to the small number of
training samples compared with GTEAplus.

4.6. Ablation Study

In order to study the effect of the individual component
of DFG, we do an ablation study and test on GTEA by re-
moving only one component in DFG at one time while the
rest of the architecture remains the same. There are three
tests: (1) we replace the two-stream 3D-CNN in G with the
same structure as [36], i.e. the background stream is “stat-
ic” while the foreground stream remains the same; (2) we
train GP directly on real frames and test GP on the gener-
ated frames from G; (3) we remove D and we only use L1
distance loss for future frame generation. Scores for gaze
anticipation in AAE and AUC are averaged every 8 frames
across 32 frames as shown in Table 2.

Table 2. Ablation Study. From top to bottom, the evaluated models
are: our best, one stream replaced by 2D convolution net; our mod-
el with Future Frame Generation Module removed and ground
truth frames as direct inputs for training and future frames for test-
ing; and the discriminator removed.

The ﬁrst ablation study on changing the background
stream to a static one leads to an increase of 0.7 in AAE.
This implies the two-stream 3D-CNN in G is essential for
learning foreground and background motions which can
further improve gaze anticipation accuracy. The second ab-
lated model with GP trained on real frames performs worse
with an increase of 2 in AAE than DFG. In DFG, GP is
attached after G for temporal saliency map prediction us-
ing end-to-end training. However, GP in the second ablated
model trained only on real frames cannot perform well s-
ince it cannot learn the essential features on the generated

4378

frames. It demonstrates that the features on the generated
frames are different from those on real frames and hence,
end-to-end training is necessary for GP to learn these es-
sential features on the generated frames. The third abla-
tion study with D removed shows an increases of 1 in AAE
from the 17th frame onwards. This demonstrates that D is
important as the feedback to GN which provides the addi-
tional constraints such that G can generate more “realistic”
future frames in longer time duration. These “realistic” fu-
ture frames are critical for gaze anticipation.

Moreover, to study the effectiveness of GAN-based ar-
chitecture, we develop a few more comparative methods.
See Supplementary Material for results and implementa-
tion details. First, we compare DFG with SalDirect: a 3D-
ConvNet directly modeling gaze anticipation. Secondly, we
develop a new model (SalFusion) which averages the tem-
poral saliency maps from both SalDirect and DFG to gen-
erate the ﬁnal temporal saliency maps. Results show DFG
outperforms SalDirect in both AAE and AUC. It suggests
GAN has essential contributions to gaze anticipation. Sal-
Fusion outperforms two composite models which conﬁrm-
s that the learnt motion cue from GANs is important and
complementary to the cues learned directly from SalDirect.
It is also observed that the gaze movement on individual
frames is dependent on their previous states; e.g. to antici-
pate gaze on the frame t+32, we need to consider gaze tran-
sitions across frames by also anticipating gaze on frames t
to t + 31. For veriﬁcation, we created one baseline: train
SALICON model, a 2D-ConvNet, directly for gaze antici-
pation at time t+16 and t+32 using their respective ground
truth at time t + 16 and t + 32. See Supplementary Materi-
al for results. DFG performs much better than SALICON.
This suggests the temporal dependence across frames plays
fundamental roles in gaze anticipation in egocentric videos
and future frame generation using GANs is useful.

In video analysis, the number of consecutive frames is a
key parameter in practice. We study the effect of the number
of frames on gaze anticipation. See Supplementary Material
for implementation and result details. From the results, we
observe that given an input frame, in order to anticipate gaze
on subsequent L frames, models trained with L + K frames
will perform better as K increases. This is because GP can
learn the temporal dynamics with more information ﬂow-
ing back from the future K frames. In the extreme scenario
where L = 1 and K = 0, this architecture will be simpli-
ﬁed as the feedforward 2D-CNN, similar as SALICON, and
hence produces lower gaze anticipation performance.

4.7. Visualization

As GP estimates temporal saliency maps based on the
generated frames, we analyze the learnt convolution ﬁlters
in GP and align the observations with human bottom-up vi-
sual attention mechanism (VA). See Supplementary Materi-

als for implementation details. We observe that the ﬁlters in
the ﬁrst convolution layer of GP learn the low level features,
such as edges and regions of high contrast. This observation
aligns well with VA which is driven by low level features at
the initial stage according to [35]. More interestingly, we
also ﬁnd the learnt features change across time, e.g.
the
black region increases from left to right across time (row 2
in Figure 7a) and the brightness in the bottom regions decay
across time (row 4 in Figure 7a). This demonstrates DFG
learns motion dynamics such as translation and the gradient
change of surfaces. As the level of convolution layers in-
creases, we can see more complex patterns. In the second
last layer, the regions containing semantic information get
activated with some examples shown in Figure 7b. This in-
cludes salient objects, such as the white bowl, the tip of the
milk box, the fonts on the oatmeal box and the bread with
peanut butter. Overall, we infer that DFG not only learns
egocentric cues in the spatial domain but also motion dy-
namics in the temporal domain.

4.8. Gaze aided Egocentric Activity Recognition

Egocentric gaze can help ﬁrst person’s activity recogni-
tion. We adapt the C3D network [34] with integration of
our anticipated gaze locations to egocentric activity recog-
nition. Results show that our gaze-aided model (28.5%) sig-
niﬁcantly surpasses the initial C3D network [34] (26.9%),
STIP [24] (14.9%), Cuboids [10] (22.7%), as well as one
baseline (13.6%) on GTEAplus 3. See Supplementary Ma-
terial for implementation details and results analysis.

5. Conclusion

We present a new challenging gaze anticipation prob-
lem on future frames as an extension of the gaze prediction
problem on current frames on egocentric videos. We de-
velop DFG built upon GAN for solving this problem. We
make great improvements on the existing works of GAN.
To explicitly learn foreground and background motions in
egocentric settings, we propose a two-stream 3D-CNN in
the generator network. The qualitative results show that our
model learns to untangle these motions. We evaluate our
model using standard metrics and our performance surpass-
es all the competitive baselines signiﬁcantly.

Abstract

We introduce a new problem of gaze anticipation on e-
gocentric videos. This substantially extends the convention-
al gaze prediction problem to future frames by no longer
conﬁning it on the current frame. To solve this problem, we
propose a new generative adversarial neural network based
model, Deep Future Gaze (DFG). DFG generates multiple
future frames conditioned on the single current frame and
anticipates corresponding future gazes in next few second-
s. It consists of two networks: generator and discriminator.
The generator uses a two-stream spatial temporal convolu-
tion architecture (3D-CNN) explicitly untangling the fore-
ground and the background to generate future frames.
It
then attaches another 3D-CNN for gaze anticipation based
on these synthetic frames. The discriminator plays against
the generator by differentiating the synthetic frames of the
generator from the real frames. Through competition with
discriminator, the generator progressively improves quality
of the future frames and thus anticipates future gaze better.
Experimental results on the publicly available egocentric
datasets show that DFG signiﬁcantly outperforms all well-
established baselines. Moreover, we demonstrate that DFG
achieves better performance of gaze prediction on current
frames than state-of-the-art methods. This is due to beneﬁt-
ing from learning motion discriminative representations in
frame generation. We further contribute a new egocentric
dataset (OST) in the object search task. DFG also achieves
the best performance for this challenging dataset.

1. Introduction

Egocentric video analysis [2], i.e. analyzing videos cap-
tured from the ﬁrst person perspective, is an emerging ﬁeld
in computer vision which can beneﬁt many applications,
such as virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR).

Figure 1. Problem illustration: gaze anticipation on future frames
within a few seconds on egocentric videos. Given the current
frame, the task is to predict the future gaze locations. Our pro-
posed DFG method solves this problem through synthesizing fu-
ture frames (transparent ones) and predicting corresponding future
gaze locations (red circles).

One of the key components in egocentric video analysis is
gaze prediction — the process of predicting the point of
gaze (where human is ﬁxating) in the head-centered coordi-
nate system. Extending the gaze prediction problem to go
beyond the current frame [37, 25], our paper presents the
new and important problem of gaze anticipation: the pre-
diction of gaze in future1 frames of egocentric videos and
proposes a promising solution.

Gaze anticipation enables the predictive computation
and is useful in many applications, such as human-machine
interaction [39, 9, 32], attention-driver user interface [22]
and interactive advertisements [29]. For example, VR head-
sets, as one category of egocentric devices, require high
computation power and fast speed for synthesizing virtual
realities upon interaction from users [28, 8]. As gaze infor-
mation reﬂects human intent and goal inferences [16, 38],
gaze anticipation facilitates the computation-demanding
systems to plan ahead on VR rendering with increased
buffer time [39]. Thus, pre-rendering of the virtual scenes

1By “future” we mean within a few seconds.

based on anticipated gaze locations within the next few sec-
onds provides smoother transitions in virtual reality and
hence better user experience [28, 8].

We tackle gaze anticipation problem in two steps. Given
the current frame, our proposed model, Deep Future Gaze
(DFG), ﬁrst generates future frames and then predicts the
gaze locations on these frames.

As the dense optical ﬂow between adjacent frames does
not prorogate well to subsequent frames [27], we propose a
generative adversarial network (GAN) based model for fu-
ture frame generation through a competition between a gen-
erator (GN) and a discriminator (D) [27, 36]. Future frame
generation of egocentric videos is a challenging task. Com-
pared with the third-person videos where the background is
often static, egocentric videos also involve complex back-
ground motion due to the head movements. We use a two-
stream spatial-temporal convolution architecture (3D-CNN)
in GN to explicitly untangle the foreground and the back-
ground motion. In the video generation approach [27], the
aim is to generate “real” videos with the random noise as
the input. Different from them, we have an additional con-
straint that our generated frames have to be based upon the
input frame. Thus, we attach a 2D convolutional network
(2D-CNN) before the GN to extract the latent representa-
tion of the current frame such that the motion dynamics of
the generated frames is consistent with the current frame
across time. Egocentric vision in a natural environment is
a complex coordination process among head motion, gaze
prediction, and body poses [23]. DFG learns automatically
to model this coordination in GN without explicitly deﬁn-
ing egocentric cues, such as hands, objects and task infor-
mation. The rich information including egocentric motion
dynamics on the generated future frames can then be useful
for gaze anticipation.

D plays against GN by differentiating the synthetic
frames of GN from the real frames. Through competition
with D, GN progressively improves quality of the future
frames based on the feedbacks from D and thus anticipates
future gazes better.

Evaluations of DFG on public egocentric datasets show
that DFG boosts up the performance of gaze anticipation to
a signiﬁcant extent surpassing all the well-established base-
lines. Additionally, DFG demonstrates its capacity of gen-
eralizing to the object search task on our new egocentric
dataset (OST). OST is one of the largest egocentric datasets
in the object search task with eyetracking information avail-
able to our best knowledge.

In summary, our paper has the following contributions:

• We introduce a new and important problem of gaze an-

ticipation on egocentric videos.

• In order to tackle this new problem, we propose a new
GAN-based model. A novel two-stream 3D-CNN is

developed to explicitly untangle foreground and back-
ground motions in egocentric videos.

• Instead of handcrafting egocentric cues, such as hands
and objects, our model automatically learns these cues
during end-to-end training.

• We provide a new egocentric dataset downloadable at
our website2. It is one of the largest in the object search
task with eye-tracking information available.

2. Related Work

In this section, we review important works related to
computational models of visual attention and gaze predic-
tion on egocentric videos in particular.

2.1. Saliency Prediction

Computational saliency models are based on feature-
integration theory [35] where low-level features, such as
color, contrast and intensity, are combined. The ﬁrst models
were developed by Koch et al. [21] and Itti et al. [19]. Sub-
sequent works [13, 41, 7, 14] further improve saliency map
predictions via various methods such as graph-based salien-
cy model [13] and boolean map based saliency [40]. The
most recent saliency models leverage rich pools of seman-
tic regions or objects in the scene from deep convolutional
neural network [17, 26], whereas they focus on saliency pre-
diction on static images and the motion information across
frames has been discarded.

There are a few works exploiting top-down mechanisms.
In [33], the contextual information from the scene was inte-
grated with low-level features for saliency prediction. Borji
et al. [3] explored a direct mapping from motor actions and
low-level features to ﬁxation locations in the driving simu-
lation scenario where motor actions are from the top-down
stream.
In these cases, additional information other than
egocentric videos is required.

2.2. Gaze Prediction on Egocentric Videos

Ba et al. [1] proposed to analyze human visual attention
by exploring correlations between head orientation and gaze
direction. Similarly, Yamada et al. [37] presented gaze pre-
diction models and explored the correlation between gaze
and head motion with the aid of external motion sensors.
However, motion sensors may increase the loads and power
consumption of wearable devices. The most recent mod-
el on gaze prediction in hand-object manipulation tasks was
proposed by Yin et al. [25]. Hand detection and pose recog-
nition provide primary egocentric cues in their model. Since
egocentric cues are predeﬁned, their model may not gener-
alize well to various egocentric activities especially when
hands are not involved.

To the best of our knowledge, we are the ﬁrst to tackle
gaze anticipation problem on egocentric videos. We pro-
pose a novel GAN-based model which can learn essential
egocentric cues automatically during the training phase. D-
ifferent from third person videos, head motion results in
moving background in egocentric videos. Thus, we adapt
the two-stream video model [31, 36] with both streams re-
placed by 3D-CNN to explicitly untangle foreground and
background motions.

3. Our Model

In this section, we ﬁrst introduce an overview of our pro-
posed model, Deep Future Gaze (DFG), and then give the
detailed analysis of its architecture. We provide the training
and implementation details in the end.

3.1. Architecture Overview

Given the current frame as the input, we aim to output a
sequence of anticipated gaze locations in the next few sec-
onds. To address this challenging problem, we propose a
generative adversarial networks (GAN) [27, 36] based mod-
el, to generate future frames and then to predict their corre-
sponding temporal saliency maps, i.e., spatial probabilistic
maps of gaze locations across time where the spatial co-
ordinates with the maximum probability are output as the
anticipated gaze locations. DFG consists of two network-
s: the Generator Network (GN) and the Discriminator Net-
work (D) as shown in Figure 2. In GN, there are two mod-
ules: Future Frame Generation Module (G) and Tempo-
ral Saliency Prediction Module (GP). See Supplementary
Material for architecture details.

3.2. The Generator Network (GN)

The goal of GN is to produce a sequence of N subse-
quent frames It+1,t+N from a latent representation h(It) of
the current frame It in G and N temporal saliency maps
St+1,t+N from It+1,t+N in GP. Here the latent representa-
tion h(It) is learned from a 2D-CNN. In order to identify
the foreground motions (hands and objects) out of the com-
plex background motion due to the head movements, we
propose a two-stream generator architecture. To avoid the
error in the frame generation accumulating from one frame
to another, G is designed to generate a sequence of N fu-
ture frames at once instead of a system where the generated
frame It+1 is fed back as the input to generate the subse-
quent frame It+2. The number of predicted frames N is
application dependent. We select 32 frames or about 2.5
seconds as we believe such duration is adequate for practi-
cal applications. The complete analysis regarding the per-
formance of our model versus number of output frames is
presented in Section 4.6.

We use 3D-CNN in two streams for learning motion rep-
resentations. Meanwhile, fractionally strided convolution

layers (upsampling layers) are added after the convolution
to preserve proper spatial and temporal resolution for the
output frame sequence. The equation for generating the se-
quence of N predicted frames It+1,t+N is

It+1,t+N =F (h(It)) ⊙ M (h(It))

+ (1 − M (h(It))) ⊙ B(h(It)),

(1)

where ⊙ is the elementwise-multiplication operation, F (·)
represents the foreground generation model and B(·) repre-
sents the background generation model. M (·) is a spatial-
temporal mask untangling foreground and background mo-
tion where its pixel value ranges from [0, 1]. In particular,
1 indicates foreground and 0 indicates background. Both
F (·) and B(·) generate a sequence of N predicted RGB-
colored frames, each frame with dimension 3 × W × H
where W and H are the width and the height of the pre-
dicted frame respectively. Foregrounds and backgrounds of
predicted frames get merged by masks M (·) of dimension
N ×1×W ×H replicated across 3 color channels to produce
It+1,t+N . The foreground, background and mask models
are parameterized by 3D-CNN. The foreground model and
the mask model share the same weights until the last layer
which has two branches, one for foreground generation for
N frames with 3 color channels and one for the mask gen-
eration for N frames with single channels. The background
generation model employs another separate 3D-CNN.

As the rich information including the learnt egocen-
tric motion dynamics on the generated future frames is
useful for visual attention in egocentric videos, we adopt
these features for gaze anticipation. Thus, G is followed
by GP to generate temporal saliency maps of dimension
N × 1 × W × H.

3.3. The Discriminator Network (D)

Generating N frames implies the need of a large number
of pixels. This is an extremely difﬁcult task when only a
single frame is given. To enhance the quality of generated
frames, DFG employs D as a competitor to G, by providing
the additional feedbacks to G [27, 36].

D aims to distinguish the synthetic examples from the
real ones. There are two criteria for the synthetic frames to
be “real”: ﬁrst, the semantics from the scene are coherent
across space (e.g. no table surface inside the refrigerator);
second, the motions from both the foreground and the back-
ground are consistent across time (e.g. hand movements
have to be smooth). Thus, D follows the same architecture
as the foreground generation model other than replacing al-
l the upsampling layers with the convolution layers as de-
tailed in Supplementary Material and this architecture has
also been shown to be effective in [36]. The output is a bi-
nary label indicating whether the input frame is fake or real.

Future Frame Generation Module of Generator Network, latent representation of the current frame It is extracted by 2D ConvNet. To
explicitly untangle foreground and background, it then branches into two streams: one for learning the representation for the foreground
and the mask; one for learning the representation of the background. These 3 streams are combined to generate future frames (blue
boundaries). Based on the generated frames, Temporal Saliency Prediction Module predicts the anticipated gaze location (red dots). As
a competitor to the generator, Discriminator Network uses a 3D ConvNet to distinguish the generated frames from real frames Rt,t+N
(black boundaries) by classifying its inputs to real or fake.

3.4. Training and Implementation Details

Training We train DFG end-to-end by stochastic gradi-
ent descent with learning rate 0.00005 and momentum 0.5.
Adam Optimizer [20] is used. G and D play against each
other. G is designed to predict future frames as “real” as
possible to fool D, while D strives to tell real frames from
the generated ones. These two networks try to minimize
the maximum payoff of its opponent with respect to their
network parameters wD and wG respectively. In addition,
we add another L1 loss term to ensure that the ﬁrst gener-
ated video frame is visually consistent with the input frame
without the over-smoothing artifacts. A hyper-parameter λ
is used for tuning the weight of losses between the min-max
game and the consistency term. Both networks are trained
alternatively. The objective function for D is

fD(Rt:t+N , h) , Lce(D(Rt:t+N ; wD), 1)

min
wD

(2)

+Lce(D(G(h; wG)), 0),

where h denotes the hidden representation h(It) of input
frame It, Rt:t+N represents the real frames and the binary
cross entropy loss Lce is deﬁned as

Lce( ˆY , Y ) = Y log( ˆY ) + (1 − Y ) log(1 − ˆY ),

(3)

where Y ∈ {0, 1} denotes real or fake and ˆY ∈ [0, 1] de-
notes the output from D.

As the opponent of D, G needs to satisfy two require-
ments: 1) the generated outputs should be real enough to
fool D; 2) the initial output of the generated frames should

be visually consistent with the current frame. The objective
function for training G is thus formulated as

fG(It) , Lce(D(G(h; wG)), 1)

min
wG

+ λkIt − G(It; wG)k1,

(4)

where λ is set as 0.1 which shows to achieve the best perfor-
mance in our case. k · k1 denoting L1 distance is preferred
over the mean square error which results in over-smoothing
in the frame generation [27].

Meanwhile, GP takes It+1,t+N as input to generate tem-
poral saliency maps. GP is trained in a supervised approach
using Kullback-Leibler divergence (KLD) loss function:

KLD(Pi, Qi) =

Pi(x, y) log

Xx Xy

Pi(x, y)
Qi(x, y) (cid:21)

,

(cid:20)

(5)

where Pi is the temporal ﬁxation map and Qi is the tempo-
ral saliency map for the (t + i)th frame.
Implementation Details DFG is developed based on [36]
in Torch. The source code is available at our website2. We
train everything from zero with the input frame size being
3 × 64 × 64. The batch size is 32. The latent representation
h(It) is of dimension 1024 × 4 × 4 after 5 layers of 2D
convolution layers for encoding image representation. We
normalize all videos to be within the range [−1, 1].
Gaze prediction on current frame DFG can also be used
for gaze prediction on the current frame. Since G outputs
a sequence of generated frames where the ﬁrst frame must
be consistent with the input frame due to L1 distance loss in

4375

Equation(4), we take the spatial coordinate with the max-
imum probability in the ﬁrst predicted temporal saliency
map as the predicted gaze location on the current frame.

4. Experiments

We test DFG on gaze anticipation as well as gaze pre-
diction over current frames on public datasets using stan-
dard evaluation metrics. To explore whether DFG can be
generalized well for other tasks in egocentric contexts, we
contribute another dataset (OST) in the object search task.
We provide detailed analysis of DFG through ablation s-
tudy and visualization of the learnt convolution ﬁlters. In
the end, we demonstrate our anticipated gazes are useful in
egocentric activity recognition.

4.1. Datasets

GTEA Dataset [11] This dataset contains 17 sequences
on meal preparation tasks performed by 14 subjects. Each
video clip lasts for about 4 minutes with the frame rate 15
fps and frame resolution 480 × 640. The subject is asked to
prepare meals freely. Same as Yin et al. [25], we use videos
1, 4, 6-22 as training set and the rest as test set.

GTEAplus Dataset [25] This dataset consists of 7 meal
preparation activities. There are 5 subjects, each performing
these 7 activities. Each video clip takes 10 to 15 minutes on
average with frame rate 12 fps and frame resolution 960 ×
1280. We do 5-fold cross validation across all 5 subjects
and take their average for evaluation as [25].

Our Dataset in Object Search Tasks (OST) Due to lack
of egocentric datasets with gaze tracking enabled, we con-
tribute this new dataset for the object search task. This
dataset consists of 57 sequences on search and retrieval
tasks performed by 55 subjects. Each video clip lasts for
around 15 minutes with the frame rate 10 fps and frame res-
olution 480 × 640. Each subject is asked to search for a list
of 22 items (including lanyard, laptop, etc.) and move them
to the packing location (dining table). Details about the 22
items are provided in Supplementary Material. See Figure 3
for exemplar frames. We select frames near the packing lo-
cation and use those from videos 1 to 7 as test set and the
rest for training and validation.

To the best of our knowledge, this is one of the largest
egocentric datasets on the object search task with eye-
tracking information available. Compared with GTEA and
GTEAplus, our dataset involves larger head motions and the
human subjects have to walk and look for objects in the
search list with hands appearing less frequently.

4.2. Evaluation Metrics

We use two standard evaluation metrics on gaze anticipa-
tion in egocentric videos: Area Under the Curve (AUC) [4]
and Average Angular Error (AAE) [30] deﬁned as below:

Figure 3. Sample frames from our introduced object search dataset
(OST). It covers various rooms in a fully furnished 2-bedroom a-
partment and includes 22 searching items. For our experiments,
only frames near the packing location (dining table) are selected.

Area Under the Curve (AUC) is the most commonly used
It measures the area under a
saliency evaluation metric.
curve of true positive versus false positive rates under vari-
ous threshold values on saliency maps.

Average Angular Error (AAE) is the angular distance be-
tween the predicted gaze location and the ground truth.

4.3. Baselines

We create several competitive baselines as follows:
First, to show the effectiveness of end-to-end learning
where all the parameters are trained jointly, we use G to
generate future frames after the training phase and compare
DFG with state-of-the-art saliency prediction algorithms on
these frames including Graph-based Visual Saliency (GB-
VS) [13], Natural Statistics Saliency (SUN) [41], Adaptive
Whitening Saliency (AWS) [12], Attention-based Informa-
tion Maximization (AIM) [6], Itti’s Model (Itti) [18], and
Image Signature Saliency (ImSig) [15].

Second, SALICON [17] is a deep learning architecture
for saliency prediction on static images. We train SALI-
CON from scratch on the egocentric datasets by using real
frames and their corresponding ﬁxation maps. After that,
the pre-trained SALICON model is tested on our generated
frames for gaze anticipation.

Third, we create another baseline (OpticalShift) to study
the effect of temporal dynamics. We use our model to pre-
dict gaze on the current frame and compute the dense opti-
cal ﬂow between the previous frame and the current frame
using [5]. The predicted gaze is then warped to the future
frames by shifting it based on the ﬂow at that position as the
future gaze locations.

Fourth, we include the graph-based method to model
gaze transition dynamics as proposed by [25] for gaze pre-
diction on current frames in GTEA and GTEAplus. We ex-
clude this method on OST since the required hand annota-
tions by [25] are not available. We also cannot extend this
method to gaze anticipation problem.

4.4. Results on Gaze Anticipation

DFG surpasses all the competitive baselines signiﬁcant-
ly in gaze anticipation. We report the quantitative evalua-
tion results in Figure 4 (AUC) and 5 (AAE). On all three
datasets, DFG outperforms all the competitive baselines by
31%, 50% and 24% in relative advance (RA) in AAE and
21%, 5% and 3% in RA in AUC with respect to the best
baseline (BB) as shown in Figure 4 and 5. RA in percent-
age is computed as

where N =32 is the number of generated future frames,
OURi is the metric score of our model and BBi is the met-
ric score of BB on the ith future frame.

Qualitative results in Figure 6 demonstrate that DFG
learns to untangle foreground and background motions. In
the foreground, both the hand and the object (the bun) get
highlighted. As the high intensity value on the mask denotes
the foreground, the manipulation point (the control point
where the subject is manipulating the object with hands)
shows the highest activation on the mask whereas the back-
ground (the table surface) is uniform over time as shown in
the darker regions of the mask.

Though SALICON learns an abundance of semantic in-
formation, it excludes temporal dependencies which are

truth with red circle denoting human gaze locations. Row 2, 3,

crucial for gaze anticipation on egocentric videos. Although
SALICON has performed better than conventional salien-
cy prediction methods, its performance is inferior to DFG

4377

which learns spatial-temporal information.

For OpticalShift, we observe that its AUC and AAE
curves drop monotonically. It conﬁrms that the optical ﬂow
computed from the current state cannot adapt to the com-
plexity of the temporal dynamics in longer time periods.

We often observe a strong center bias (CB) in egocen-
tric videos. This is due to the fact that egocentric videos
are captured from the ﬁrst person perspective. Humans al-
ways move their heads to attend to the regions of interest.
In this case, gazes often align with head orientations. Thus,
gaze shift in the large distance gets compensated by head
movements with small gaze shifts. The statistics of ampli-
tudes for head and gaze motions in our test sets for GTEA
and GTEAplus datasets are provided in Supplementary Ma-
terial. To validate DFG predicts more than CB, we ﬁt a
Gaussian mask in the center to generate temporal saliency
maps. As AUC favors CB, we use sAUC to compare our
model with CB and report sAUC scores as: DFG (0.58) and
CB (0.5) in GTEA, DFG (0.61) and CB (0.5) in GTEAplus
as well as DFG (0.56) and CB (0.49) in OST. It conﬁrms
that our model incorporates various egocentric information
and motion dynamics for gaze anticipation rather than CB.
Based on the statistics of the two motions in our testsets, it
also shows that both GP and G are critical for better gaze
anticipation by estimating the two motions separately.

4.5. Results on Current Frame Gaze Prediction

We compare DFG with state-of-the-art saliency predic-
tion algorithms in Section 4.3 on real frames in the testsets
of three datasets and report both AAE and AUC scores of
gaze prediction on current frames in Table 1. Results show
that DFG performs competitively well or better than the-
state-of-the-arts even without explicitly specifying egocen-
tric cues, such as hands and objects of interest. Moreover,
different from the traditional methods, our model takes the
current frame as the only input without the past informa-
tion. We observe that AAE scores are lower than Yin et al.
[25] on GTEA and this may be due to the small number of
training samples compared with GTEAplus.

4.6. Ablation Study

In order to study the effect of the individual component
of DFG, we do an ablation study and test on GTEA by re-
moving only one component in DFG at one time while the
rest of the architecture remains the same. There are three
tests: (1) we replace the two-stream 3D-CNN in G with the
same structure as [36], i.e. the background stream is “stat-
ic” while the foreground stream remains the same; (2) we
train GP directly on real frames and test GP on the gener-
ated frames from G; (3) we remove D and we only use L1
distance loss for future frame generation. Scores for gaze
anticipation in AAE and AUC are averaged every 8 frames
across 32 frames as shown in Table 2.

Table 2. Ablation Study. From top to bottom, the evaluated models
are: our best, one stream replaced by 2D convolution net; our mod-
el with Future Frame Generation Module removed and ground
truth frames as direct inputs for training and future frames for test-
ing; and the discriminator removed.

The ﬁrst ablation study on changing the background
stream to a static one leads to an increase of 0.7 in AAE.
This implies the two-stream 3D-CNN in G is essential for
learning foreground and background motions which can
further improve gaze anticipation accuracy. The second ab-
lated model with GP trained on real frames performs worse
with an increase of 2 in AAE than DFG. In DFG, GP is
attached after G for temporal saliency map prediction us-
ing end-to-end training. However, GP in the second ablated
model trained only on real frames cannot perform well s-
ince it cannot learn the essential features on the generated

4378

frames. It demonstrates that the features on the generated
frames are different from those on real frames and hence,
end-to-end training is necessary for GP to learn these es-
sential features on the generated frames. The third abla-
tion study with D removed shows an increases of 1 in AAE
from the 17th frame onwards. This demonstrates that D is
important as the feedback to GN which provides the addi-
tional constraints such that G can generate more “realistic”
future frames in longer time duration. These “realistic” fu-
ture frames are critical for gaze anticipation.

Moreover, to study the effectiveness of GAN-based ar-
chitecture, we develop a few more comparative methods.
See Supplementary Material for results and implementa-
tion details. First, we compare DFG with SalDirect: a 3D-
ConvNet directly modeling gaze anticipation. Secondly, we
develop a new model (SalFusion) which averages the tem-
poral saliency maps from both SalDirect and DFG to gen-
erate the ﬁnal temporal saliency maps. Results show DFG
outperforms SalDirect in both AAE and AUC. It suggests
GAN has essential contributions to gaze anticipation. Sal-
Fusion outperforms two composite models which conﬁrm-
s that the learnt motion cue from GANs is important and
complementary to the cues learned directly from SalDirect.
It is also observed that the gaze movement on individual
frames is dependent on their previous states; e.g. to antici-
pate gaze on the frame t+32, we need to consider gaze tran-
sitions across frames by also anticipating gaze on frames t
to t + 31. For veriﬁcation, we created one baseline: train
SALICON model, a 2D-ConvNet, directly for gaze antici-
pation at time t+16 and t+32 using their respective ground
truth at time t + 16 and t + 32. See Supplementary Materi-
al for results. DFG performs much better than SALICON.
This suggests the temporal dependence across frames plays
fundamental roles in gaze anticipation in egocentric videos
and future frame generation using GANs is useful.

In video analysis, the number of consecutive frames is a
key parameter in practice. We study the effect of the number
of frames on gaze anticipation. See Supplementary Material
for implementation and result details. From the results, we
observe that given an input frame, in order to anticipate gaze
on subsequent L frames, models trained with L + K frames
will perform better as K increases. This is because GP can
learn the temporal dynamics with more information ﬂow-
ing back from the future K frames. In the extreme scenario
where L = 1 and K = 0, this architecture will be simpli-
ﬁed as the feedforward 2D-CNN, similar as SALICON, and
hence produces lower gaze anticipation performance.

4.7. Visualization

As GP estimates temporal saliency maps based on the
generated frames, we analyze the learnt convolution ﬁlters
in GP and align the observations with human bottom-up vi-
sual attention mechanism (VA). See Supplementary Materi-

als for implementation details. We observe that the ﬁlters in
the ﬁrst convolution layer of GP learn the low level features,
such as edges and regions of high contrast. This observation
aligns well with VA which is driven by low level features at
the initial stage according to [35]. More interestingly, we
also ﬁnd the learnt features change across time, e.g.
the
black region increases from left to right across time (row 2
in Figure 7a) and the brightness in the bottom regions decay
across time (row 4 in Figure 7a). This demonstrates DFG
learns motion dynamics such as translation and the gradient
change of surfaces. As the level of convolution layers in-
creases, we can see more complex patterns. In the second
last layer, the regions containing semantic information get
activated with some examples shown in Figure 7b. This in-
cludes salient objects, such as the white bowl, the tip of the
milk box, the fonts on the oatmeal box and the bread with
peanut butter. Overall, we infer that DFG not only learns
egocentric cues in the spatial domain but also motion dy-
namics in the temporal domain.

4.8. Gaze aided Egocentric Activity Recognition

Egocentric gaze can help ﬁrst person’s activity recogni-
tion. We adapt the C3D network [34] with integration of
our anticipated gaze locations to egocentric activity recog-
nition. Results show that our gaze-aided model (28.5%) sig-
niﬁcantly surpasses the initial C3D network [34] (26.9%),
STIP [24] (14.9%), Cuboids [10] (22.7%), as well as one
baseline (13.6%) on GTEAplus 3. See Supplementary Ma-
terial for implementation details and results analysis.

5. Conclusion

We present a new challenging gaze anticipation prob-
lem on future frames as an extension of the gaze prediction
problem on current frames on egocentric videos. We de-
velop DFG built upon GAN for solving this problem. We
make great improvements on the existing works of GAN.
To explicitly learn foreground and background motions in
egocentric settings, we propose a two-stream 3D-CNN in
the generator network. The qualitative results show that our
model learns to untangle these motions. We evaluate our
model using standard metrics and our performance surpass-
es all the competitive baselines signiﬁcantly.

Abstract

We introduce a new problem of gaze anticipation on e-
gocentric videos. This substantially extends the convention-
al gaze prediction problem to future frames by no longer
conﬁning it on the current frame. To solve this problem, we
propose a new generative adversarial neural network based
model, Deep Future Gaze (DFG). DFG generates multiple
future frames conditioned on the single current frame and
anticipates corresponding future gazes in next few second-
s. It consists of two networks: generator and discriminator.
The generator uses a two-stream spatial temporal convolu-
tion architecture (3D-CNN) explicitly untangling the fore-
ground and the background to generate future frames.
It
then attaches another 3D-CNN for gaze anticipation based
on these synthetic frames. The discriminator plays against
the generator by differentiating the synthetic frames of the
generator from the real frames. Through competition with
discriminator, the generator progressively improves quality
of the future frames and thus anticipates future gaze better.
Experimental results on the publicly available egocentric
datasets show that DFG signiﬁcantly outperforms all well-
established baselines. Moreover, we demonstrate that DFG
achieves better performance of gaze prediction on current
frames than state-of-the-art methods. This is due to beneﬁt-
ing from learning motion discriminative representations in
frame generation. We further contribute a new egocentric
dataset (OST) in the object search task. DFG also achieves
the best performance for this challenging dataset.

1. Introduction

Egocentric video analysis [2], i.e. analyzing videos cap-
tured from the ﬁrst person perspective, is an emerging ﬁeld
in computer vision which can beneﬁt many applications,
such as virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR).

Figure 1. Problem illustration: gaze anticipation on future frames
within a few seconds on egocentric videos. Given the current
frame, the task is to predict the future gaze locations. Our pro-
posed DFG method solves this problem through synthesizing fu-
ture frames (transparent ones) and predicting corresponding future
gaze locations (red circles).

One of the key components in egocentric video analysis is
gaze prediction — the process of predicting the point of
gaze (where human is ﬁxating) in the head-centered coordi-
nate system. Extending the gaze prediction problem to go
beyond the current frame [37, 25], our paper presents the
new and important problem of gaze anticipation: the pre-
diction of gaze in future1 frames of egocentric videos and
proposes a promising solution.

Gaze anticipation enables the predictive computation
and is useful in many applications, such as human-machine
interaction [39, 9, 32], attention-driver user interface [22]
and interactive advertisements [29]. For example, VR head-
sets, as one category of egocentric devices, require high
computation power and fast speed for synthesizing virtual
realities upon interaction from users [28, 8]. As gaze infor-
mation reﬂects human intent and goal inferences [16, 38],
gaze anticipation facilitates the computation-demanding
systems to plan ahead on VR rendering with increased
buffer time [39]. Thus, pre-rendering of the virtual scenes

based on anticipated gaze locations within the next few sec-
onds provides smoother transitions in virtual reality and
hence better user experience [28, 8].

We tackle gaze anticipation problem in two steps. Given
the current frame, our proposed model, Deep Future Gaze
(DFG), ﬁrst generates future frames and then predicts the
gaze locations on these frames.

As the dense optical ﬂow between adjacent frames does
not prorogate well to subsequent frames [27], we propose a
generative adversarial network (GAN) based model for fu-
ture frame generation through a competition between a gen-
erator (GN) and a discriminator (D) [27, 36]. Future frame
generation of egocentric videos is a challenging task. Com-
pared with the third-person videos where the background is
often static, egocentric videos also involve complex back-
ground motion due to the head movements. We use a two-
stream spatial-temporal convolution architecture (3D-CNN)
in GN to explicitly untangle the foreground and the back-
ground motion. In the video generation approach [27], the
aim is to generate “real” videos with the random noise as
the input. Different from them, we have an additional con-
straint that our generated frames have to be based upon the
input frame. Thus, we attach a 2D convolutional network
(2D-CNN) before the GN to extract the latent representa-
tion of the current frame such that the motion dynamics of
the generated frames is consistent with the current frame
across time. Egocentric vision in a natural environment is
a complex coordination process among head motion, gaze
prediction, and body poses [23]. DFG learns automatically
to model this coordination in GN without explicitly deﬁn-
ing egocentric cues, such as hands, objects and task infor-
mation. The rich information including egocentric motion
dynamics on the generated future frames can then be useful
for gaze anticipation.

D plays against GN by differentiating the synthetic
frames of GN from the real frames. Through competition
with D, GN progressively improves quality of the future
frames based on the feedbacks from D and thus anticipates
future gazes better.

Evaluations of DFG on public egocentric datasets show
that DFG boosts up the performance of gaze anticipation to
a signiﬁcant extent surpassing all the well-established base-
lines. Additionally, DFG demonstrates its capacity of gen-
eralizing to the object search task on our new egocentric
dataset (OST). OST is one of the largest egocentric datasets
in the object search task with eyetracking information avail-
able to our best knowledge.

In summary, our paper has the following contributions:

• We introduce a new and important problem of gaze an-

ticipation on egocentric videos.

• In order to tackle this new problem, we propose a new
GAN-based model. A novel two-stream 3D-CNN is

developed to explicitly untangle foreground and back-
ground motions in egocentric videos.

• Instead of handcrafting egocentric cues, such as hands
and objects, our model automatically learns these cues
during end-to-end training.

• We provide a new egocentric dataset downloadable at
our website2. It is one of the largest in the object search
task with eye-tracking information available.

2. Related Work

In this section, we review important works related to
computational models of visual attention and gaze predic-
tion on egocentric videos in particular.

2.1. Saliency Prediction

Computational saliency models are based on feature-
integration theory [35] where low-level features, such as
color, contrast and intensity, are combined. The ﬁrst models
were developed by Koch et al. [21] and Itti et al. [19]. Sub-
sequent works [13, 41, 7, 14] further improve saliency map
predictions via various methods such as graph-based salien-
cy model [13] and boolean map based saliency [40]. The
most recent saliency models leverage rich pools of seman-
tic regions or objects in the scene from deep convolutional
neural network [17, 26], whereas they focus on saliency pre-
diction on static images and the motion information across
frames has been discarded.

There are a few works exploiting top-down mechanisms.
In [33], the contextual information from the scene was inte-
grated with low-level features for saliency prediction. Borji
et al. [3] explored a direct mapping from motor actions and
low-level features to ﬁxation locations in the driving simu-
lation scenario where motor actions are from the top-down
stream.
In these cases, additional information other than
egocentric videos is required.

2.2. Gaze Prediction on Egocentric Videos

Ba et al. [1] proposed to analyze human visual attention
by exploring correlations between head orientation and gaze
direction. Similarly, Yamada et al. [37] presented gaze pre-
diction models and explored the correlation between gaze
and head motion with the aid of external motion sensors.
However, motion sensors may increase the loads and power
consumption of wearable devices. The most recent mod-
el on gaze prediction in hand-object manipulation tasks was
proposed by Yin et al. [25]. Hand detection and pose recog-
nition provide primary egocentric cues in their model. Since
egocentric cues are predeﬁned, their model may not gener-
alize well to various egocentric activities especially when
hands are not involved.

To the best of our knowledge, we are the ﬁrst to tackle
gaze anticipation problem on egocentric videos. We pro-
pose a novel GAN-based model which can learn essential
egocentric cues automatically during the training phase. D-
ifferent from third person videos, head motion results in
moving background in egocentric videos. Thus, we adapt
the two-stream video model [31, 36] with both streams re-
placed by 3D-CNN to explicitly untangle foreground and
background motions.

3. Our Model

In this section, we ﬁrst introduce an overview of our pro-
posed model, Deep Future Gaze (DFG), and then give the
detailed analysis of its architecture. We provide the training
and implementation details in the end.

3.1. Architecture Overview

Given the current frame as the input, we aim to output a
sequence of anticipated gaze locations in the next few sec-
onds. To address this challenging problem, we propose a
generative adversarial networks (GAN) [27, 36] based mod-
el, to generate future frames and then to predict their corre-
sponding temporal saliency maps, i.e., spatial probabilistic
maps of gaze locations across time where the spatial co-
ordinates with the maximum probability are output as the
anticipated gaze locations. DFG consists of two network-
s: the Generator Network (GN) and the Discriminator Net-
work (D) as shown in Figure 2. In GN, there are two mod-
ules: Future Frame Generation Module (G) and Tempo-
ral Saliency Prediction Module (GP). See Supplementary
Material for architecture details.

3.2. The Generator Network (GN)

The goal of GN is to produce a sequence of N subse-
quent frames It+1,t+N from a latent representation h(It) of
the current frame It in G and N temporal saliency maps
St+1,t+N from It+1,t+N in GP. Here the latent representa-
tion h(It) is learned from a 2D-CNN. In order to identify
the foreground motions (hands and objects) out of the com-
plex background motion due to the head movements, we
propose a two-stream generator architecture. To avoid the
error in the frame generation accumulating from one frame
to another, G is designed to generate a sequence of N fu-
ture frames at once instead of a system where the generated
frame It+1 is fed back as the input to generate the subse-
quent frame It+2. The number of predicted frames N is
application dependent. We select 32 frames or about 2.5
seconds as we believe such duration is adequate for practi-
cal applications. The complete analysis regarding the per-
formance of our model versus number of output frames is
presented in Section 4.6.

We use 3D-CNN in two streams for learning motion rep-
resentations. Meanwhile, fractionally strided convolution

layers (upsampling layers) are added after the convolution
to preserve proper spatial and temporal resolution for the
output frame sequence. The equation for generating the se-
quence of N predicted frames It+1,t+N is

It+1,t+N =F (h(It)) ⊙ M (h(It))

+ (1 − M (h(It))) ⊙ B(h(It)),

(1)

where ⊙ is the elementwise-multiplication operation, F (·)
represents the foreground generation model and B(·) repre-
sents the background generation model. M (·) is a spatial-
temporal mask untangling foreground and background mo-
tion where its pixel value ranges from [0, 1]. In particular,
1 indicates foreground and 0 indicates background. Both
F (·) and B(·) generate a sequence of N predicted RGB-
colored frames, each frame with dimension 3 × W × H
where W and H are the width and the height of the pre-
dicted frame respectively. Foregrounds and backgrounds of
predicted frames get merged by masks M (·) of dimension
N ×1×W ×H replicated across 3 color channels to produce
It+1,t+N . The foreground, background and mask models
are parameterized by 3D-CNN. The foreground model and
the mask model share the same weights until the last layer
which has two branches, one for foreground generation for
N frames with 3 color channels and one for the mask gen-
eration for N frames with single channels. The background
generation model employs another separate 3D-CNN.

As the rich information including the learnt egocen-
tric motion dynamics on the generated future frames is
useful for visual attention in egocentric videos, we adopt
these features for gaze anticipation. Thus, G is followed
by GP to generate temporal saliency maps of dimension
N × 1 × W × H.

3.3. The Discriminator Network (D)

Generating N frames implies the need of a large number
of pixels. This is an extremely difﬁcult task when only a
single frame is given. To enhance the quality of generated
frames, DFG employs D as a competitor to G, by providing
the additional feedbacks to G [27, 36].

D aims to distinguish the synthetic examples from the
real ones. There are two criteria for the synthetic frames to
be “real”: ﬁrst, the semantics from the scene are coherent
across space (e.g. no table surface inside the refrigerator);
second, the motions from both the foreground and the back-
ground are consistent across time (e.g. hand movements
have to be smooth). Thus, D follows the same architecture
as the foreground generation model other than replacing al-
l the upsampling layers with the convolution layers as de-
tailed in Supplementary Material and this architecture has
also been shown to be effective in [36]. The output is a bi-
nary label indicating whether the input frame is fake or real.

Figure 2. Architecture of our proposed Deep Future Gaze (DFG) model. It contains Generator Network and Discriminator Network. In
Future Frame Generation Module of Generator Network, latent representation of the current frame It is extracted by 2D ConvNet. To
explicitly untangle foreground and background, it then branches into two streams: one for learning the representation for the foreground
and the mask; one for learning the representation of the background. These 3 streams are combined to generate future frames (blue
boundaries). Based on the generated frames, Temporal Saliency Prediction Module predicts the anticipated gaze location (red dots). As
a competitor to the generator, Discriminator Network uses a 3D ConvNet to distinguish the generated frames from real frames Rt,t+N
(black boundaries) by classifying its inputs to real or fake.

3.4. Training and Implementation Details

Training We train DFG end-to-end by stochastic gradi-
ent descent with learning rate 0.00005 and momentum 0.5.
Adam Optimizer [20] is used. G and D play against each
other. G is designed to predict future frames as “real” as
possible to fool D, while D strives to tell real frames from
the generated ones. These two networks try to minimize
the maximum payoff of its opponent with respect to their
network parameters wD and wG respectively. In addition,
we add another L1 loss term to ensure that the ﬁrst gener-
ated video frame is visually consistent with the input frame
without the over-smoothing artifacts. A hyper-parameter λ
is used for tuning the weight of losses between the min-max
game and the consistency term. Both networks are trained
alternatively. The objective function for D is

fD(Rt:t+N , h) , Lce(D(Rt:t+N ; wD), 1)

min
wD

(2)

+Lce(D(G(h; wG)), 0),

where h denotes the hidden representation h(It) of input
frame It, Rt:t+N represents the real frames and the binary
cross entropy loss Lce is deﬁned as

Lce( ˆY , Y ) = Y log( ˆY ) + (1 − Y ) log(1 − ˆY ),

(3)

where Y ∈ {0, 1} denotes real or fake and ˆY ∈ [0, 1] de-
notes the output from D.

As the opponent of D, G needs to satisfy two require-
ments: 1) the generated outputs should be real enough to
fool D; 2) the initial output of the generated frames should

be visually consistent with the current frame. The objective
function for training G is thus formulated as

fG(It) , Lce(D(G(h; wG)), 1)

min
wG

+ λkIt − G(It; wG)k1,

(4)

where λ is set as 0.1 which shows to achieve the best perfor-
mance in our case. k · k1 denoting L1 distance is preferred
over the mean square error which results in over-smoothing
in the frame generation [27].

Meanwhile, GP takes It+1,t+N as input to generate tem-
poral saliency maps. GP is trained in a supervised approach
using Kullback-Leibler divergence (KLD) loss function:

KLD(Pi, Qi) =

Pi(x, y) log

Xx Xy

Pi(x, y)
Qi(x, y) (cid:21)

,

(cid:20)

(5)

where Pi is the temporal ﬁxation map and Qi is the tempo-
ral saliency map for the (t + i)th frame.
Implementation Details DFG is developed based on [36]
in Torch. The source code is available at our website2. We
train everything from zero with the input frame size being
3 × 64 × 64. The batch size is 32. The latent representation
h(It) is of dimension 1024 × 4 × 4 after 5 layers of 2D
convolution layers for encoding image representation. We
normalize all videos to be within the range [−1, 1].
Gaze prediction on current frame DFG can also be used
for gaze prediction on the current frame. Since G outputs
a sequence of generated frames where the ﬁrst frame must
be consistent with the input frame due to L1 distance loss in

4375

Equation(4), we take the spatial coordinate with the max-
imum probability in the ﬁrst predicted temporal saliency
map as the predicted gaze location on the current frame.

4. Experiments

We test DFG on gaze anticipation as well as gaze pre-
diction over current frames on public datasets using stan-
dard evaluation metrics. To explore whether DFG can be
generalized well for other tasks in egocentric contexts, we
contribute another dataset (OST) in the object search task.
We provide detailed analysis of DFG through ablation s-
tudy and visualization of the learnt convolution ﬁlters. In
the end, we demonstrate our anticipated gazes are useful in
egocentric activity recognition.

4.1. Datasets

GTEA Dataset [11] This dataset contains 17 sequences
on meal preparation tasks performed by 14 subjects. Each
video clip lasts for about 4 minutes with the frame rate 15
fps and frame resolution 480 × 640. The subject is asked to
prepare meals freely. Same as Yin et al. [25], we use videos
1, 4, 6-22 as training set and the rest as test set.

GTEAplus Dataset [25] This dataset consists of 7 meal
preparation activities. There are 5 subjects, each performing
these 7 activities. Each video clip takes 10 to 15 minutes on
average with frame rate 12 fps and frame resolution 960 ×
1280. We do 5-fold cross validation across all 5 subjects
and take their average for evaluation as [25].

Our Dataset in Object Search Tasks (OST) Due to lack
of egocentric datasets with gaze tracking enabled, we con-
tribute this new dataset for the object search task. This
dataset consists of 57 sequences on search and retrieval
tasks performed by 55 subjects. Each video clip lasts for
around 15 minutes with the frame rate 10 fps and frame res-
olution 480 × 640. Each subject is asked to search for a list
of 22 items (including lanyard, laptop, etc.) and move them
to the packing location (dining table). Details about the 22
items are provided in Supplementary Material. See Figure 3
for exemplar frames. We select frames near the packing lo-
cation and use those from videos 1 to 7 as test set and the
rest for training and validation.

To the best of our knowledge, this is one of the largest
egocentric datasets on the object search task with eye-
tracking information available. Compared with GTEA and
GTEAplus, our dataset involves larger head motions and the
human subjects have to walk and look for objects in the
search list with hands appearing less frequently.

4.2. Evaluation Metrics

We use two standard evaluation metrics on gaze anticipa-
tion in egocentric videos: Area Under the Curve (AUC) [4]
and Average Angular Error (AAE) [30] deﬁned as below:

Figure 3. Sample frames from our introduced object search dataset
(OST). It covers various rooms in a fully furnished 2-bedroom a-
partment and includes 22 searching items. For our experiments,
only frames near the packing location (dining table) are selected.

Area Under the Curve (AUC) is the most commonly used
It measures the area under a
saliency evaluation metric.
curve of true positive versus false positive rates under vari-
ous threshold values on saliency maps.

Average Angular Error (AAE) is the angular distance be-
tween the predicted gaze location and the ground truth.

4.3. Baselines

We create several competitive baselines as follows:
First, to show the effectiveness of end-to-end learning
where all the parameters are trained jointly, we use G to
generate future frames after the training phase and compare
DFG with state-of-the-art saliency prediction algorithms on
these frames including Graph-based Visual Saliency (GB-
VS) [13], Natural Statistics Saliency (SUN) [41], Adaptive
Whitening Saliency (AWS) [12], Attention-based Informa-
tion Maximization (AIM) [6], Itti’s Model (Itti) [18], and
Image Signature Saliency (ImSig) [15].

Second, SALICON [17] is a deep learning architecture
for saliency prediction on static images. We train SALI-
CON from scratch on the egocentric datasets by using real
frames and their corresponding ﬁxation maps. After that,
the pre-trained SALICON model is tested on our generated
frames for gaze anticipation.

Third, we create another baseline (OpticalShift) to study
the effect of temporal dynamics. We use our model to pre-
dict gaze on the current frame and compute the dense opti-
cal ﬂow between the previous frame and the current frame
using [5]. The predicted gaze is then warped to the future
frames by shifting it based on the ﬂow at that position as the
future gaze locations.

Fourth, we include the graph-based method to model
gaze transition dynamics as proposed by [25] for gaze pre-
diction on current frames in GTEA and GTEAplus. We ex-
clude this method on OST since the required hand annota-
tions by [25] are not available. We also cannot extend this
method to gaze anticipation problem.

4.4. Results on Gaze Anticipation

DFG surpasses all the competitive baselines signiﬁcant-
ly in gaze anticipation. We report the quantitative evalua-
tion results in Figure 4 (AUC) and 5 (AAE). On all three
datasets, DFG outperforms all the competitive baselines by
31%, 50% and 24% in relative advance (RA) in AAE and
21%, 5% and 3% in RA in AUC with respect to the best
baseline (BB) as shown in Figure 4 and 5. RA in percent-
age is computed as

where N =32 is the number of generated future frames,
OURi is the metric score of our model and BBi is the met-
ric score of BB on the ith future frame.

Qualitative results in Figure 6 demonstrate that DFG
learns to untangle foreground and background motions. In
the foreground, both the hand and the object (the bun) get
highlighted. As the high intensity value on the mask denotes
the foreground, the manipulation point (the control point
where the subject is manipulating the object with hands)
shows the highest activation on the mask whereas the back-
ground (the table surface) is uniform over time as shown in
the darker regions of the mask.

Though SALICON learns an abundance of semantic in-
formation, it excludes temporal dependencies which are

ahead) based on the current frame. Frames #1, 5, 9, 17, 29 are
shown (left to right columns). The topmost row shows the ground
truth with red circle denoting human gaze locations. Row 2, 3,

ed temporal saliency maps. Best viewed in color.

crucial for gaze anticipation on egocentric videos. Although
SALICON has performed better than conventional salien-
cy prediction methods, its performance is inferior to DFG

4377

which learns spatial-temporal information.

For OpticalShift, we observe that its AUC and AAE
curves drop monotonically. It conﬁrms that the optical ﬂow
computed from the current state cannot adapt to the com-
plexity of the temporal dynamics in longer time periods.

We often observe a strong center bias (CB) in egocen-
tric videos. This is due to the fact that egocentric videos
are captured from the ﬁrst person perspective. Humans al-
ways move their heads to attend to the regions of interest.
In this case, gazes often align with head orientations. Thus,
gaze shift in the large distance gets compensated by head
movements with small gaze shifts. The statistics of ampli-
tudes for head and gaze motions in our test sets for GTEA
and GTEAplus datasets are provided in Supplementary Ma-
terial. To validate DFG predicts more than CB, we ﬁt a
Gaussian mask in the center to generate temporal saliency
maps. As AUC favors CB, we use sAUC to compare our
model with CB and report sAUC scores as: DFG (0.58) and
CB (0.5) in GTEA, DFG (0.61) and CB (0.5) in GTEAplus
as well as DFG (0.56) and CB (0.49) in OST. It conﬁrms
that our model incorporates various egocentric information
and motion dynamics for gaze anticipation rather than CB.
Based on the statistics of the two motions in our testsets, it
also shows that both GP and G are critical for better gaze
anticipation by estimating the two motions separately.

4.5. Results on Current Frame Gaze Prediction

We compare DFG with state-of-the-art saliency predic-
tion algorithms in Section 4.3 on real frames in the testsets
of three datasets and report both AAE and AUC scores of
gaze prediction on current frames in Table 1. Results show
that DFG performs competitively well or better than the-
state-of-the-arts even without explicitly specifying egocen-
tric cues, such as hands and objects of interest. Moreover,
different from the traditional methods, our model takes the
current frame as the only input without the past informa-
tion. We observe that AAE scores are lower than Yin et al.
[25] on GTEA and this may be due to the small number of
training samples compared with GTEAplus.

4.6. Ablation Study

In order to study the effect of the individual component
of DFG, we do an ablation study and test on GTEA by re-
moving only one component in DFG at one time while the
rest of the architecture remains the same. There are three
tests: (1) we replace the two-stream 3D-CNN in G with the
same structure as [36], i.e. the background stream is “stat-
ic” while the foreground stream remains the same; (2) we
train GP directly on real frames and test GP on the gener-
ated frames from G; (3) we remove D and we only use L1
distance loss for future frame generation. Scores for gaze
anticipation in AAE and AUC are averaged every 8 frames
across 32 frames as shown in Table 2.

Table 2. Ablation Study. From top to bottom, the evaluated models
are: our best, one stream replaced by 2D convolution net; our mod-
el with Future Frame Generation Module removed and ground
truth frames as direct inputs for training and future frames for test-
ing; and the discriminator removed.

The ﬁrst ablation study on changing the background
stream to a static one leads to an increase of 0.7 in AAE.
This implies the two-stream 3D-CNN in G is essential for
learning foreground and background motions which can
further improve gaze anticipation accuracy. The second ab-
lated model with GP trained on real frames performs worse
with an increase of 2 in AAE than DFG. In DFG, GP is
attached after G for temporal saliency map prediction us-
ing end-to-end training. However, GP in the second ablated
model trained only on real frames cannot perform well s-
ince it cannot learn the essential features on the generated

4378

frames. It demonstrates that the features on the generated
frames are different from those on real frames and hence,
end-to-end training is necessary for GP to learn these es-
sential features on the generated frames. The third abla-
tion study with D removed shows an increases of 1 in AAE
from the 17th frame onwards. This demonstrates that D is
important as the feedback to GN which provides the addi-
tional constraints such that G can generate more “realistic”
future frames in longer time duration. These “realistic” fu-
ture frames are critical for gaze anticipation.

Moreover, to study the effectiveness of GAN-based ar-
chitecture, we develop a few more comparative methods.
See Supplementary Material for results and implementa-
tion details. First, we compare DFG with SalDirect: a 3D-
ConvNet directly modeling gaze anticipation. Secondly, we
develop a new model (SalFusion) which averages the tem-
poral saliency maps from both SalDirect and DFG to gen-
erate the ﬁnal temporal saliency maps. Results show DFG
outperforms SalDirect in both AAE and AUC. It suggests
GAN has essential contributions to gaze anticipation. Sal-
Fusion outperforms two composite models which conﬁrm-
s that the learnt motion cue from GANs is important and
complementary to the cues learned directly from SalDirect.
It is also observed that the gaze movement on individual
frames is dependent on their previous states; e.g. to antici-
pate gaze on the frame t+32, we need to consider gaze tran-
sitions across frames by also anticipating gaze on frames t
to t + 31. For veriﬁcation, we created one baseline: train
SALICON model, a 2D-ConvNet, directly for gaze antici-
pation at time t+16 and t+32 using their respective ground
truth at time t + 16 and t + 32. See Supplementary Materi-
al for results. DFG performs much better than SALICON.
This suggests the temporal dependence across frames plays
fundamental roles in gaze anticipation in egocentric videos
and future frame generation using GANs is useful.

In video analysis, the number of consecutive frames is a
key parameter in practice. We study the effect of the number
of frames on gaze anticipation. See Supplementary Material
for implementation and result details. From the results, we
observe that given an input frame, in order to anticipate gaze
on subsequent L frames, models trained with L + K frames
will perform better as K increases. This is because GP can
learn the temporal dynamics with more information ﬂow-
ing back from the future K frames. In the extreme scenario
where L = 1 and K = 0, this architecture will be simpli-
ﬁed as the feedforward 2D-CNN, similar as SALICON, and
hence produces lower gaze anticipation performance.

4.7. Visualization

As GP estimates temporal saliency maps based on the
generated frames, we analyze the learnt convolution ﬁlters
in GP and align the observations with human bottom-up vi-
sual attention mechanism (VA). See Supplementary Materi-

als for implementation details. We observe that the ﬁlters in
the ﬁrst convolution layer of GP learn the low level features,
such as edges and regions of high contrast. This observation
aligns well with VA which is driven by low level features at
the initial stage according to [35]. More interestingly, we
also ﬁnd the learnt features change across time, e.g.
the
black region increases from left to right across time (row 2
in Figure 7a) and the brightness in the bottom regions decay
across time (row 4 in Figure 7a). This demonstrates DFG
learns motion dynamics such as translation and the gradient
change of surfaces. As the level of convolution layers in-
creases, we can see more complex patterns. In the second
last layer, the regions containing semantic information get
activated with some examples shown in Figure 7b. This in-
cludes salient objects, such as the white bowl, the tip of the
milk box, the fonts on the oatmeal box and the bread with
peanut butter. Overall, we infer that DFG not only learns
egocentric cues in the spatial domain but also motion dy-
namics in the temporal domain.

4.8. Gaze aided Egocentric Activity Recognition

Egocentric gaze can help ﬁrst person’s activity recogni-
tion. We adapt the C3D network [34] with integration of
our anticipated gaze locations to egocentric activity recog-
nition. Results show that our gaze-aided model (28.5%) sig-
niﬁcantly surpasses the initial C3D network [34] (26.9%),
STIP [24] (14.9%), Cuboids [10] (22.7%), as well as one
baseline (13.6%) on GTEAplus 3. See Supplementary Ma-
terial for implementation details and results analysis.

5. Conclusion

We present a new challenging gaze anticipation prob-
lem on future frames as an extension of the gaze prediction
problem on current frames on egocentric videos. We de-
velop DFG built upon GAN for solving this problem. We
make great improvements on the existing works of GAN.
To explicitly learn foreground and background motions in
egocentric settings, we propose a two-stream 3D-CNN in
the generator network. The qualitative results show that our
model learns to untangle these motions. We evaluate our
model using standard metrics and our performance surpass-
es all the competitive baselines signiﬁcantly.
