Abstract— Although Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) can 
be  used  to  generate  the  realistic  image,  improper  use  of  these 
technologies  brings  hidden  concerns.  For  example,  GAN  can  be 
used  to  generate  a  tampered  video  for  specific  people  and 
inappropriate  events,  creating  images  that  are  detrimental  to  a 
particular person, and may even affect that personal safety. In this 
paper, we will develop a deep forgery discriminator (DeepFD) to 
efficiently and effectively detect the computer-generated images. 
Directly learning a binary classifier is relatively tricky since it is 
hard to find the common discriminative features for judging the 
fake  images  generated  from  different  GANs.  To  address  this 
shortcoming,  we  adopt  contrastive  loss  in  seeking  the  typical 
features  of  the  synthesized  images  generated  by  different  GANs 
and follow by concatenating a classifier to detect such computer-
generated  images.  Experimental  results  demonstrate  that  the 
proposed  DeepFD  successfully  detected  94.7%  fake  images 
generated by several state-of-the-art GANs.

I.  INTRODUCTION 

With the rapid growth of deep learning techniques for image 
generation,  the  security  issues  because  of  malicious  uses  of 
such image generation/synthesis became more important. For 
example, progressive growing of GANs (PGGAN) proposed by 
nVidia  [4]  have  demonstrated  that  the  realistic  and  high-
resolution face images can be easily synthesized. It can be used 
to  create  a  fake  personal  account  on  Facebook  to  cheat 
something or someone [1]. It will cause very serious problems 
on the society, political, and commercial activities. Therefore, 
an effective and efficient images forgery detection technique is 
desired. 

To  address  the  issue  of  image  forgery  detection,  there  are 
two different categories in the traditional approach: 1) extrinsic 
feature  and  2)  intrinsic  feature.  First  forgery  detection  will 
embed  external  unique  signals  into  the  original  images  (e.g. 
digital watermarking). Then, the received image can be verified 
whether  it  is  a  forgery  or  not  by  comparing  the  extracted 
watermark  and  the  original  watermark.  The  second  strategy 
will tend to discover the intrinsic and invariant features from 
the  original  images.  The  forgery  image  should  be  able  to 
detected  by  checking  the  statistical  property  of  the  extracted 
intrinsic feature from the received image because any tampered 
operation  will  make  the  intrinsic  feature  changed.  The  first 

strategy needs the original externally signal to check whether it 
is  a  forgery  or  not.  In  general,  it  is  relatively  hard  to  have 
originally  external  signal  (i.e.  watermark)  for  any  received 
image. In contrast, the second strategy only seeks the intrinsic 
feature  of  the  received  image,  finding  the  unusual  statistical 
property of it, to detect whether it is a forgery or not [3]. 

There are several approaches to find the intrinsic features of 
images  to  determine  the  tampered  images  [2][3]  The  forgery 
detection  technique  in  [2]  finds  sensor  pattern  noise  as  the 
intrinsic feature. Double compression cues are used in [13] as 
the  intrinsic  feature  for  JPEG  formatted  image.  However, 
traditional forgery detection techniques are hard to detect the 
generated images by GANs since their image content are made 
by deep neural network directly. Therefore, it does not exist any 
unusually  statistical  property  in  the  intrinsic  features  of  the 
received  images,  leading  to  traditional  forgery  detection 
approach  fails  to  detect  the  generated  images.    To  solve  this 
shortcoming,  we  propose  a  deep  neural  network  called  deep 
forgery  discriminator  (DeepFD)  based  strategy  to  effectively 
and efficiently detect the generated / fake images synthesized 
by GANs or other advanced networks. 

There is an easy to train a deep neural network classifier to 
distinguish fake images and real images by collecting a large 
training  set  containing  fake  and  real  images.  However,  the 
trained  classifier  might  be  ineffectively  to  detect  the  fake 
images  synthesized  by  a  new  GAN  or  other  advanced 
generators because it did not learn the discriminative features 
from newly generated images. In general, it is hard to collect 
training  images  generated  by  all  possible  GANs  or  image 
synthesizers.  Moreover, there are  many new  GANs proposed 
every year. Such strategy needs to re-train the classifier to keep 
its performance when there is a new GAN proposed. To ensure 
the performance of the proposed DeepFD, we tend to learn the 
jointly  discriminative  features  from  collected  training  images 
across different GANs by introducing the contrastive loss into 
the  network  learning  framework  [12].  Contrastive  loss  learns 
such  joint  features  from  heterogeneous  training  images  by 
introducing the pairwise information so that the DeepFD should 
be able to effectively distinguish any fake image generated by 
any GAN. Besides, the proposed DeepFD can further localize 
unrealistic  details  of  the  fake  image  based  on  a  fully 
convolutional architecture. Our contributions are summarized 
below: 

  We  propose  a  novel  deep  neural  network  based 
discriminator  based  on  contrastive  loss,  upon  which 
we can distinguish the fake images generated by any 
GANs.  To  the  best  of  our  knowledge,  the  proposed 
method  is  the  first  research  effectively  addressing 
generated image detection.  
The  proposed  DeepFD  can  be  used  to  localize 
unrealistic details of the fake image and we can follow 
such regions to further improve the performance of the 
proposed DeepFD. 

 

The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Sec. II presents 
the proposed DeepFD for forgery image detection. In Sec. III, 
experimental results are demonstrated. Finally, conclusions are 
drawn in Sec. IV.  

II.  THE PROPOSED DEEP FORGERY DISCRIMINATOR 
Figure  1  shows  the  flowchart  of  the  proposed  DeepFD.  In 
the proposed method, we have two learning phases. First, we 
collect a lot of fake images synthesized by several GANs called 
example-generative model and real images to learn the jointly 
discriminative  features  D1  based  on  the  proposed  contrastive 
loss.  Afterward,  a  discriminator  (classifier)  D2  will  be 
concatenated to the D1 to further distinguish fake images. In the 
test phase, it is easy to distinguish the test image whether it is 
fake  or  real  by  D1  and  D2  directly.  The  details  of  network 
architectures in D1 and D2 are respectively described in Table I. 
Note, the classifier D2 is directly concatenated to the 4th layer 
of the jointly discriminative feature learning network D1.

discriminative features of the fake images. In our experiments, 
it  is  enough  that  we  adopt  1  million  pairs  to  learn  the  joint 
feature.  
A.  Jointly Discriminative Feature Learning 

Let  the  feature  representation 

.  With  a  paired 
input  images,  the  purpose  of  jointly  discriminative  feature 
learning  is  to  minimize  the  similarity  function  defined  as 
follows: 

R𝑖𝑖 = D1(𝐱𝐱𝑖𝑖)

where  we  use  the  exact  same  network 

 
 to  extract  the 
E𝑊𝑊(𝐱𝐱1, 𝐱𝐱2) = ‖D1(𝐱𝐱1) − D1(𝐱𝐱2)‖,
features  of  the  paired  input  images.  Directly  minimizing 
D1
 to  a 
 may  lead  the  feature  representation 
constant  mapping  [12].  This  situation  will  make  the  feature 
E𝑊𝑊(𝐱𝐱1, 𝐱𝐱2)
representation ineffective and useless. In contrast, we introduce 
the contrastive loss:

Once  the  jointly  discriminative  feature  representation  has 
learned, there are several ways to classify the received images 
such as SVM, random forest classifier, or Bayer classifier. In 
this work, we directly concatenate a convolutional layer and a 
fully connected layer to the network D1 (See details in Table I). 
In  this  way,  the  proposed  DeepFD  will  be  an  end-to-end 
architecture.  

The loss function of the classifier can be defined as a cross-

entropy loss:

The classifier can be easily trained by back-propagation [10]. 
Note, the parameters in all layers in D1 will be updated as well 
because the jointly discriminative feature learned by D1 might 
be further improved. In this way, we believe that the fake image 
can be effectively detected.

III. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS 

A.  Experimental Settings 

To generate the training samples, the CelebA dataset will be 
used  in  this  experiments.  The  images  in  CelebA  cover  large 
pose  variations  and  background  clutter  including  10,177 
number of identities and 202,599 aligned face images.  

In experiments,  we collected  five state-of-the-art GANs to 

generate the fake images pool:  

1) DCGAN (Deep convolutional GAN) [6] 
2) WGAP (Wasserstein GAN) [7] 
3) WGAN-GP (WGAN with Gradient Penalty) [8]  
4) LSGAN (Least Squares GAN) [9] 
5) PGGAN [4] 
Each  GAN  will  be  used  to  generate  200,000  fake  images 
 into  the  fake  image  pool.  PGGAN  will 
sized  of 
.  We 
produce  a  high-resolution  result  sized  of 
downsample  the  fake  images  generated  by  PGGAN  into 
resolution 
 to  have  a  fair  comparison.  Since  the 
resolution of fake image of PGGAN is downscaled into 

64 × 64

64 × 64

64 × 64

,  the  recognition  task  is  relatively  difficult  because  some 
64 ×
unrealistic details of the fake images are eliminated. Then, we 
64
randomly pick 202,599 fake images from the fake image pool. 
Finally, we have 400,198 training images and 5,000 test images 
containing real and fake images. 

In the parameters setting of D1 and D2, the learning rate is 
1e-3 and the maximum epoch is 15. The marginal value m in 
contrastive loss is 0.5. Adam optimizer [11] is used for training 
D1  and  D2.  In  first  two  epochs,  we  only  adopt  pairwise 
information to learn D1. Afterward, the collected fake and real 
images will be used to learn D2. The batch size is 32. 

A traditional image forgery detection is used for comparison 
[3]. We also design a baseline approach based on the proposed 

Fig. 2  The curve of the contrastive loss for learning D1 using  pairwise 
information.

(Blue line) / without (Orang line) contrastive loss for training set excluding 
LSGAN. 

DeepFD without contrastive loss to emphasize our contribution. 
On the other hand, we also remove the proposed classifier and 
replace it with other advanced classifiers such as RFC (Random 
forest  classifier),  SVM  (Support  vector  machine),  and  LC 
(Linear  classifier)  to  demonstrate  the  effectiveness  of  the 
proposed DeepFD.  

B.  Performance Comparison 

To obtain the jointly discriminative feature for our task, we 
adopt pairwise information to guide D1 learning in two epochs. 
Figure 2 shows that the proposed contrastive loss is stable and 
will be converged. Although the contrastive loss is no longer 
used after 25,000 iterations (2 epochs), the contrastive loss did 
not  increase.  It  has  also  verified  a  fact  that  the  jointly 
discriminative  feature  learning  is  associated  with  classifier 
learning.  Figure  3  presents  the  test  accuracy  comparison 
between  the  proposed  DeepFD  with  and  without  contrastive 
loss  learning.  It  is  clear  that  the  proposed  DeepFD  is  easily 
converged and reach higher performance.  

To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed DeepFD, 
we separate the fake images generated by one of the collected 
GAN methods from the training pool. A generalized DeepFD 
should be able to detect the fake images even they are not used 
in the training.  Table II indicates the performance comparison 
between the proposed DeepFD and other baseline methods in 
terms of accuracy, precision, and recall. The proposed DeepFD 
significantly  outperforms  other  techniques.  It  is  also  verified 
that  the  proposed  DeepFD  is  more  generalized  and  effective 
than  others.  On  the  other  hand,  we  observed  that  the 
performance  gain  of  the  proposed  method  for  the  training 
dataset excluding  LSGAN is  significantly better because that 
the  LSGAN  shows  fewer  unrealistic  details  in  the  generated 
images.  Therefore,  the  purely  supervised  approach  (i.e.,  the 
proposed method without contrastive loss) cannot well capture 
the common features for the fake image. The proposed DeepFD 
is easier to extract the jointly discriminative feature for all kinds 
of the fake images, leading to higher performance. 

C.  Visualization of the Unrealistic Details in the Fake Images  
Since  the  proposed  DeepFD  is  designed  to  be  a  fully 
convolutional  network,  the  feature  maps  can  be  visualized  to 
localize the unrealistic details in the fake images. Inspired by 
fully convolutional network [14], there are two channels in the 
last convolutional layer in the proposed classifier D2, leading to 
the learning goal of this layer will tend to learn a high activated 
feature  representation,  which  can  be  considered  as  the 
unrealistic details localization. Six visualization results of the 
fake images generated by PGGAN are shown in Fig. 4. It well 
knows that the performance on image synthesis task of PGGAN 
is the state-of-the-art. However, some artifacts in the generated 
images  still  can  be  found.  In  the  proposed  DeepFD,  most  of 
such  artifacts  can  be  successfully  localized,  bring  an  extra 
benefit that the detecting performance can be further improved 
by investigating these visualized results. 

IV. CONCLUSIONS 

In  this  study,  we  have  proposed  a  novel  deep  forgery 
discriminator  (DeepFD)  based  on  embedding  the  contrastive 
loss,  to  successfully  detect  the  fake  /  generated  images 
generated  by  state-of-the-art  GANs.  To  the  best  of  our 
knowledge, the proposed approach is the first work to solve the 
problems of detecting the fake images. The main contribution 
is that the contrastive loss can be used to well capture the joint 
discriminative  features  of  the  fake  images  generated  by 
different  GANs.  Besides,  the  proposed  classifier  refinement

process  leads  to  further  boost  the  classification  performance 
and can be used to visualize the unrealistic details in the fake 
images. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed 
method  outperforms  other  baseline  approaches  in  terms  of 
precision and recall rate.
