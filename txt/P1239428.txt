Abstract
Traditional automatic evaluation measures for
natural language generation (NLG) use costly
human-authored references to estimate the qual-
ity of a system output. In this paper, we propose
a referenceless quality estimation (QE) approach
based on recurrent neural networks, which pre-
dicts a quality score for a NLG system output
by comparing it to the source meaning represen-
tation only. Our method outperforms traditional
metrics and a constant baseline in most respects;
we also show that synthetic data helps to increase
correlation results by 21% compared to the base
system. Our results are comparable to results ob-
tained in similar QE tasks despite the more chal-
lenging setting.

1. Introduction

Automatic evaluation of natural
language generation
(NLG) is a complex task due to multiple acceptable out-
comes. Apart from manual human evaluation, most re-
cent works in NLG are evaluated using word-overlap-based
metrics such as BLEU (Gkatzia & Mahamood, 2015),
which compute similarity against gold-standard human ref-
erences. However, high quality human references are
costly to obtain, and for most word-overlap metrics, a min-
imum of 4 references are needed in order to achieve reli-
able results (Finch et al., 2004). Furthermore, these metrics
tend to perform poorly at segment level (Lavie & Agarwal,
2007; Chen & Cherry, 2014; Novikova et al., 2017a).

We present a novel approach to assessing NLG output qual-
ity without human references, focusing on segment-level
(utterance-level) quality assessments.1 We train a recur-
rent neural network (RNN) to estimate the quality of an

1In our data, a “segment” refers to an utterance generated by
an NLG system in the context of a human-computer dialogue,
typically 1 or 2 sentences in length (see Section 3.1). We estimate
the utterance quality without taking the dialogue context into ac-

Figure 1. The architecture of our referenceless NLG QE model.

NLG output based on comparison with the source meaning
representation (MR) only. This allows to efﬁciently assess
NLG quality not only during system development, but also
at runtime, e.g. for optimisation, reranking, or compensat-
ing low-quality output by rule-based fallback strategies.

To evaluate our method, we use crowdsourced human qual-
ity assessments of real system outputs from three different
NLG systems on three datasets in two domains. We also
show that adding fabricated data with synthesised errors to
the training set increases relative performance by 21% (as
measured by Pearson correlation).

In contrast to recent advances in referenceless quality es-
timation (QE) in other ﬁelds such as machine translation
(MT) (Bojar et al., 2016) or grammatical error correction
(Napoles et al., 2016), NLG QE is more challenging be-
cause (1) diverse realisations of a single MR are often ac-
ceptable (as the MR is typically a limited formal language);
(2) human perception of NLG quality is highly variable,
e.g. (Dethlefs et al., 2014); (3) NLG datasets are costly to
obtain and thus small in size. Despite these difﬁculties, we
achieve promising results – correlations with human judge-
ments achieved by our system stay in a somewhat lower
range than those achieved e.g. by state-of-the-art MT QE
systems (Bojar et al., 2016), but they signiﬁcantly outper-
form word-overlap metrics. To our knowledge, this is the
ﬁrst work in trainable NLG QE without references.

2. Our Model

We use a simple RNN model based on Gated Recurrent
Units (GRUs) (Cho et al., 2014), composed of one GRU

count. Assessing the appropriateness of responses in context is
beyond the scope of this paper, see e.g. (Liu et al., 2016; Lowe
et al., 2017; Cercas Curry et al., 2017).

Referenceless Quality Estimation for Natural Language Generation

The ﬁnal prediction is given by a linear layer:

encoder each for the source MR and the NLG system out-
put to be rated, followed by fully connected layers operat-
ing over the last hidden states of both encoders. The ﬁnal
classiﬁcation layer is linear and produces the quality as-
sessment as a single ﬂoating point number (see Figure 1).2

1 , . . . , xS

The model assumes both the source MR and the system
output to be sequences of tokens xM = {xM
m },
xS = {xS
n}, where each token is represented by
its embedding (Bengio et al., 2003). The GRU encoders
encode these sequences left-to-right into sequences of hid-
den states {hM

Wk+1 is a weight vector.

The network is trained in a supervised setting by min-
imising mean square error against human-assigned quality
scores on the training data (see Section 3). Embedding vec-
tors are initialised randomly and learned during training;
each token found in the training data is given an embedding
dictionary entry. Dropout (Hinton et al., 2012) is applied on
the inputs to the GRU encoders for regularisation.

The ﬂoating point values predicted by the network are
rounded to the precision and clipped to the range found in
the training data.3

2.1. Model Variants

We also experimented with several variants of the model
which performed similarly or worse than those presented
in Section 4. We list them here for completeness:

• replacing GRU cells with LSTM (Hochreiter &

Schmidhuber, 1997),

• using word embeddings pretrained by the word2vec
tool (Mikolov et al., 2013) on Google News data,4

2The meaning of this number depends entirely on the train-
ing data. In our case, we use a 1–6 Likert scale assessment (see
Section 3.1), but we could, for instance, use the same network to
predict the required number of post-edits, as commonly done in
MT (see Section 5).

3We use a precision of 0.5 and the 1–6 range (see Section 3.1).
4We used the model available at https://code.google.

In the following, we describe the data we use to evaluate
our system, our method for data augmentation, detailed pa-
rameters of our model, and evaluation metrics.

3.1. Dataset

Using the CrowdFlower crowdsourcing platform,6 we col-
lected a dataset of human rankings for outputs of three re-
cent data-driven NLG systems as provided to us by the sys-
tems’ authors; see (Novikova et al., 2017a) for more details.
The following systems are included in our set:

• LOLS (Lampouras & Vlachos, 2016), which is based

on imitation learning,

• RNNLG (Wen et al., 2015), a RNN-based system,

• TGen (Duˇsek & Jurˇc´ıˇcek, 2015), a system using

perceptron-guided incremental tree generation.

Their outputs are on the test parts of the following datasets
(see Table 1):

• BAGEL (Mairesse et al., 2010) – 404 short text seg-
ments (1–2 sentences) informing about restaurants,

• SFRest (Wen et al., 2015) – ca. 5,000 segments from
the restaurant information domain (including ques-
tions, conﬁrmations, greetings, etc.),

• SFHot (Wen et al., 2015) – a set from the hotel domain

similar in size and contents to SFRest.

During the crowdsourcing evaluation of the outputs, crowd

B = BLEU, M = METEOR, R = ROUGE, C = CIDEr, S4 = rating given by our system in the S4 conﬁguration. The metrics are shown

rated low by all metrics, our system is more accurate. The bottom one is rated low by humans but high by some metrics and our system.

workers were given two random system outputs along with
the source MRs and were asked to evaluate the absolute
overall quality of both outputs on a 1–6 Likert scale (see
Figure 2). We collected at least three ratings for each sys-
tem output; this resulted in more ratings for the same sen-
tence if two systems’ outputs were identical. The ratings
show a moderate inter-rater agreement of 0.45 (p < 0.001)
intra-class correlation coefﬁcient (Landis & Koch, 1977)
across all three datasets. We computed medians of the three
(or more) ratings in our experiments to ensure more consis-
tent ratings, which resulted in .5 ratings for some examples.
We keep this granularity throughout our experiments.

We use our data in a 5-fold cross-validation setting (three
training, one development, and one test part in each fold).
We also test our model on a subset of ratings for a particular
NLG system or dataset in order to assess its cross-system
and cross-domain performance (see Section 4).

3.2. Data Preprocessing

The source MRs in our data are variants of the dialogue acts
(DA) formalism (Young et al., 2010) – a shallow domain-
speciﬁc MR, consisting of the main DA type (hello, inform,
request) and an optional set of slots (attributes, such as food
or location) and values (e.g. Chinese for food or city cen-
tre for location). DAs are converted into sequences for our
system as a list of triplets “DA type – slot – value”, where
DA type may be repeated multiple times and/or special null
tokens are used if slots or values are not present (see Fig-
ure 1). The system outputs are tokenised and lowercased
for our purposes.

We use delexicalisation to prevent data sparsity, following
(Mairesse et al., 2010; Henderson et al., 2014; Wen et al.,
2015), where values of most DA slots (except unknown and
binary yes/no values) are replaced in both the source MRs
and the system outputs by slot placeholders – e.g. Chinese
is replaced by X-food (cf. also Figure 1).7

7Note that only values matching the source MR are delexi-
calised in the system outputs – if the outputs contain values not
present in the source MR, they are kept intact in the model input.

mentation procedures (varies slightly in different cross-validation
folds due to rounding).

3.3. Synthesising Additional Training Data

Following prior works in grammatical error correction (Ro-
zovskaya et al., 2012; Felice & Yuan, 2014; Xie et al.,
2016), we synthesise additional training instances by in-
troducing artiﬁcial errors: Given a training instance (source
MR, system output, and human rating), we generate a num-
ber of errors in the system output and lower the human rat-
ing accordingly. We use a set of basic heuristics mimicking
some of the observed system behaviour to introduce errors
into the system outputs:8

1. removing a word,

2. duplicating a word at its current position,

3. duplicating a word at a random position,

4. adding a random word from a dictionary learned from

all training system outputs,

5. replacing a word with a random word from the dictio-

nary.

We lower the original Likert scale rating of the instance by
1 for each generated error. If the original rating was 5.5 or
6, the rating is lowered to 4 with the ﬁrst introduced error
and by 1 for each additional error.

8To ensure that the errors truly are detrimental to the system
output quality, our rules prioritise content words, i.e. they do not
change articles or punctuation if other words are present. The
rules never remove the last word left in the system output.

Referenceless Quality Estimation for Natural Language Generation

We also experiment with using additional natural language
sentences where human ratings are not available – we
use human-authored references from the original training
datasets and assume that these would receive the maximum
rating of 6. We introduce artiﬁcial errors into the human
references in exactly the same way as with training system
outputs.

3.4. Model Training Parameters

We set the network parameters based on several exper-
iments performed on the development set of one of the
cross-validation folds (see Section 3.1).9

We train the network for 500 passes over the training data,
checking Pearson and Spearman correlations on the valida-
tion set after each pass (with equal importance). We keep
the conﬁguration that yielded the best correlations overall.
For setups using synthetic training data (see Section 3.3),
we ﬁrst perform 20 passes over all data including synthetic,
keeping the best parameters, and then proceed with 500
passes over the original data. To compensate for the ef-
fects of random network initialisation, all our results are
averaged over ﬁve runs with different initial random seeds
following Wen et al. (2015).

3.5. Evaluation Measures

Following practices from MT Quality estimation (Bojar
et al., 2016),10 we use Pearson’s correlation of the predicted
output quality with median human ratings as our primary
evaluation metric. Mean absolute error (MAE), root mean
squared error (RMSE), and Spearman’s rank correlation are
used as additional metrics.

We compare our results to some of the common word-
overlap metrics – BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002), METEOR
(Lavie & Agarwal, 2007), ROUGE-L (Lin, 2004), and
CIDEr (Vedantam et al., 2015) – normalised into the 1–6
range of the predicted human ratings and further rounded
to 0.5 steps.11 In addition, we also show the MAE/RMSE
values for a trivial constant baseline that always predicts
the overall average human rating (4.5).

4. Results

We test the following conﬁgurations that only differ in the
amount and nature of synthetic data used (see Section 3.3

9We use embedding size 300, learning rate 0.0001, dropout

probability 0.5, and two fully connected tanh layers (k = 2).

mation shared task at http://www.statmt.org/wmt17/

obtain the metrics scores (Chen et al., 2015). Trials with non-
quantised metrics yielded very similar correlations.

S1 Base system variant, with no synthetic data.

S2 Adding synthetic data – introducing artiﬁcial errors
into system outputs from the training portion of our
dataset (no additional human references are used).

S3 Same as previous, but with additional human refer-
ences from the training portion of our dataset (includ-
ing artiﬁcial errors; see Section 3.3).12

S4 As previous, but with additional human references
from the training parts of the respective source NLG
datasets (including artiﬁcial errors), i.e. references on
which the original NLG systems were trained.12

S5 As previous, but also includes additional human ref-
erences from the test portion of our dataset (including
artiﬁcial errors).13

S6 As previous, but also includes development parts of
the source NLG datasets (including artiﬁcial errors).

Synthetic data are never created from system outputs in the
test part of our dataset. Note that S1 and S2 only use the
original system outputs and their ratings, with no additional
human references. S3 and S4 use additional human ref-
erences (i.e. more in-domain data), but do not use human
references for the instances on which the system is tested.
S5 and S6 also use human references for test MRs, even if
not directly, and are thus not strictly referenceless.

4.1. Results using the whole dataset

The correlations and error values we obtained over the
whole data in a cross-validation setup are shown in Ta-
ble 3. The correlations only stay moderate for all system
variants. On the other hand, we can see that even the base
setup (S1) trained using less than 2,000 examples performs
better than all the word-overlap metrics in terms of all eval-
uation measures. Improvements in both Pearson and Spear-
man correlations are signiﬁcant according to the Williams
test (Williams, 1959; Kilickaya et al., 2017) (p < 0.01).
When comparing the base setup against the constant base-
line, MAE is lower but RMSE is slightly higher, which sug-
gests that our system does better on average but is prone to
occasional large errors.

The results also show that the performance can be im-
proved considerably by adding synthetic data, especially
after more than tripling the training data in S4 (Pearson cor-
relation improvements are statistically signiﬁcant in terms

12As mentioned in Section 3.1, our dataset only comprises the
test sets of the source NLG datasets, i.e. the additional human
references in S3 represent a portion of the source test sets. The
difference to S4 is the amount of the additional data (see Table 2).
13Note that the model still does not have any access at training

time to test NLG system outputs or their true ratings.

of the Williams test, p < 0.01). Using additional human
references for the test data seems to be helping further in S6
(the difference in Pearson correlation is statistically signif-
icant, p < 0.01): The additional references apparently pro-
vide more information even though the SFHot and SFRest
datasets have similar MRs (identical when delexicalised) in
training and test data (Lampouras & Vlachos, 2016).14 The
setups using larger synthetic data further improve MAE and
RMSE: S4 and S6 increase the margin against the constant
baseline up to ca. 0.1 in terms of MAE, and both are able
to surpass the constant baseline in terms of RMSE.

4.2. Cross-domain and Cross-System Training

Next, we test how well our approach generalises to new
systems and datasets and how much in-set data (same do-
main/system) is needed to obtain reasonable results. We
use the SFHot data as our test domain and LOLS as our
test system, and we treat the rest as out-of-set. We test
three different conﬁgurations:

C1 Training exclusively using a small amount of in-set
data (200 instances, 100 reserved for validation), test-
ing on the rest of the in-set.

C2 Training and validating exclusively on out-of-set data,
testing on the same part of the in-set as in C1 and C3.

C3 Training on the out-of-set data with a small amount
of in-set data (200 instances, 100 reserved for valida-
tion), testing on the rest of the in-set.

14Note that unlike in NLG systems training on SFHot and
SFRest, the identical MRs in training and test data do not allow
our system to only memorize the training data as the NLG out-
puts to be rated are distinct. However, the situation is not 100%
referenceless as the system may have been exposed to other NLG
outputs for the same MR. Our preliminary experiments suggest
that our systems can also handle lexicalised data well, without
any modiﬁcation (Pearson correlation 0.264–0.359 for S1–S6).

The results are shown in Tables 4 and 5, respectively.

The correlations of C2 suggest that while our network can
generalise across systems to some extent (if data fabrica-
tion is used), it does not generalise well across domains
without using in-domain training data. C1 and C3 conﬁgu-
ration results demonstrate that even small amounts of in-set
data help noticeably. However, if in-set data is used, addi-
tional out-of-set data does not improve the results in most
cases (C3 is mostly not signiﬁcantly better than the corre-
sponding C1).

Except for a few cross-system C2 conﬁgurations with low
amounts of synthetic data, all systems perform better than
word-overlap metrics. However, most setups are not able
to improve over the constant baseline in terms of MAE and
RMSE.

5. Related Work

This work is the ﬁrst NLG QE system to our knowledge;
the most related work in NLG is probably the system by
Dethlefs et al. (2014), which reranks NLG outputs by es-
timating their properties (such as colloquialism or polite-
ness) using various regression models. However, our work
is also related to QE research in other areas, such as MT
(Specia et al., 2010), dialogue systems (Lowe et al., 2017)
or grammatical error correction (Napoles et al., 2016). QE
is especially well researched for MT, where regular QE
shared tasks are organised (Callison-Burch et al., 2012; Bo-
jar et al., 2013; 2014; 2015; 2016).

Many of the past MT QE systems participating in the
shared tasks are based on Support Vector Regression (Spe-
cia et al., 2015; Bojar et al., 2014; 2015). Only in the past
year, NN-based solutions started to emerge. Patel & M
(2016) present a system based on RNN language models,
which focuses on predicting MT quality on the word level.

Kim & Lee (2016) estimate segment-level MT output qual-
ity using a bidirectional RNN over both source and output
sentences combined with a logistic prediction layer. They
pretrain their RNN on large MT training data.

Last year’s MT QE shared task systems achieve Pearson
correlations between 0.4–0.5, which is slightly higher than
our best results. However, the results are not directly com-
parable: First, we predict a Likert-scale assessment instead
of the number of required post-edits. Second, NLG datasets
are considerably smaller than corpora available for MT.
Third, we believe that QE for NLG is harder due to the
reasons outlined in Section 1.

6. Conclusions and Future Work

We presented the ﬁrst system for referenceless quality es-
timation of natural language generation outputs. All code
and data used here is available online at:

https://github.com/tuetschek/ratpred

In an evaluation spanning outputs of three different NLG

systems and three datasets, our system signiﬁcantly out-
performed four commonly used reference-based metrics. It
also improved over a constant baseline, which always pre-
dicts the mean human rating, in terms of MAE and RMSE.
The smaller RMSE improvement suggests that our sys-
tem is prone to occasional large errors. We have shown
that generating additional training data, e.g. by using NLG
training datasets and synthetic errors, signiﬁcantly im-
proves the system performance. While our system can gen-
eralise to unseen NLG systems in the same domain to some
extent, its cross-domain generalisation capability is poor.
However, very small amounts of in-domain/in-system data
improve performance notably.

In future work, we will explore improvements to our error
synthesising methods as well as changes to our network ar-
chitecture (bidirectional RNNs or convolutional NNs). We
also plan to focus on relative ranking of different NLG out-
puts for the same source MR or predicting the number of
post-edits required. We intend to use data collected within
the ongoing E2E NLG Challenge (Novikova et al., 2017b),
which promises greater diversity than current datasets.

Abstract
Traditional automatic evaluation measures for
natural language generation (NLG) use costly
human-authored references to estimate the qual-
ity of a system output. In this paper, we propose
a referenceless quality estimation (QE) approach
based on recurrent neural networks, which pre-
dicts a quality score for a NLG system output
by comparing it to the source meaning represen-
tation only. Our method outperforms traditional
metrics and a constant baseline in most respects;
we also show that synthetic data helps to increase
correlation results by 21% compared to the base
system. Our results are comparable to results ob-
tained in similar QE tasks despite the more chal-
lenging setting.

1. Introduction

Automatic evaluation of natural
language generation
(NLG) is a complex task due to multiple acceptable out-
comes. Apart from manual human evaluation, most re-
cent works in NLG are evaluated using word-overlap-based
metrics such as BLEU (Gkatzia & Mahamood, 2015),
which compute similarity against gold-standard human ref-
erences. However, high quality human references are
costly to obtain, and for most word-overlap metrics, a min-
imum of 4 references are needed in order to achieve reli-
able results (Finch et al., 2004). Furthermore, these metrics
tend to perform poorly at segment level (Lavie & Agarwal,
2007; Chen & Cherry, 2014; Novikova et al., 2017a).

We present a novel approach to assessing NLG output qual-
ity without human references, focusing on segment-level
(utterance-level) quality assessments.1 We train a recur-
rent neural network (RNN) to estimate the quality of an

1In our data, a “segment” refers to an utterance generated by
an NLG system in the context of a human-computer dialogue,
typically 1 or 2 sentences in length (see Section 3.1). We estimate
the utterance quality without taking the dialogue context into ac-

Figure 1. The architecture of our referenceless NLG QE model.

NLG output based on comparison with the source meaning
representation (MR) only. This allows to efﬁciently assess
NLG quality not only during system development, but also
at runtime, e.g. for optimisation, reranking, or compensat-
ing low-quality output by rule-based fallback strategies.

To evaluate our method, we use crowdsourced human qual-
ity assessments of real system outputs from three different
NLG systems on three datasets in two domains. We also
show that adding fabricated data with synthesised errors to
the training set increases relative performance by 21% (as
measured by Pearson correlation).

In contrast to recent advances in referenceless quality es-
timation (QE) in other ﬁelds such as machine translation
(MT) (Bojar et al., 2016) or grammatical error correction
(Napoles et al., 2016), NLG QE is more challenging be-
cause (1) diverse realisations of a single MR are often ac-
ceptable (as the MR is typically a limited formal language);
(2) human perception of NLG quality is highly variable,
e.g. (Dethlefs et al., 2014); (3) NLG datasets are costly to
obtain and thus small in size. Despite these difﬁculties, we
achieve promising results – correlations with human judge-
ments achieved by our system stay in a somewhat lower
range than those achieved e.g. by state-of-the-art MT QE
systems (Bojar et al., 2016), but they signiﬁcantly outper-
form word-overlap metrics. To our knowledge, this is the
ﬁrst work in trainable NLG QE without references.

2. Our Model

We use a simple RNN model based on Gated Recurrent
Units (GRUs) (Cho et al., 2014), composed of one GRU

count. Assessing the appropriateness of responses in context is
beyond the scope of this paper, see e.g. (Liu et al., 2016; Lowe
et al., 2017; Cercas Curry et al., 2017).

Referenceless Quality Estimation for Natural Language Generation

The ﬁnal prediction is given by a linear layer:

3. Experimental Setup

encoder each for the source MR and the NLG system out-
put to be rated, followed by fully connected layers operat-
ing over the last hidden states of both encoders. The ﬁnal
classiﬁcation layer is linear and produces the quality as-
sessment as a single ﬂoating point number (see Figure 1).2

1 , . . . , xS

The model assumes both the source MR and the system
output to be sequences of tokens xM = {xM
m },
xS = {xS
n}, where each token is represented by
its embedding (Bengio et al., 2003). The GRU encoders
encode these sequences left-to-right into sequences of hid-
den states {hM
t=1:

In (3–5), W0 . . . Wk stand for square weight matrices,
Wk+1 is a weight vector.

The network is trained in a supervised setting by min-
imising mean square error against human-assigned quality
scores on the training data (see Section 3). Embedding vec-
tors are initialised randomly and learned during training;
each token found in the training data is given an embedding
dictionary entry. Dropout (Hinton et al., 2012) is applied on
the inputs to the GRU encoders for regularisation.

The ﬂoating point values predicted by the network are
rounded to the precision and clipped to the range found in
the training data.3

2.1. Model Variants

We also experimented with several variants of the model
which performed similarly or worse than those presented
in Section 4. We list them here for completeness:

• replacing GRU cells with LSTM (Hochreiter &

Schmidhuber, 1997),

• using word embeddings pretrained by the word2vec
tool (Mikolov et al., 2013) on Google News data,4

2The meaning of this number depends entirely on the train-
ing data. In our case, we use a 1–6 Likert scale assessment (see
Section 3.1), but we could, for instance, use the same network to
predict the required number of post-edits, as commonly done in
MT (see Section 5).

3We use a precision of 0.5 and the 1–6 range (see Section 3.1).
4We used the model available at https://code.google.

dicting one of the individual target quality levels (see
Section 3.1),

• using an ordered set of binary classiﬁers trained to pre-
dict 1 for NLG outputs above a speciﬁed quality level,
0 below it,5

• pretraining the network using a different task (classi-
fying MRs or predicting next word in the sentence).

In the following, we describe the data we use to evaluate
our system, our method for data augmentation, detailed pa-
rameters of our model, and evaluation metrics.

3.1. Dataset

Using the CrowdFlower crowdsourcing platform,6 we col-
lected a dataset of human rankings for outputs of three re-
cent data-driven NLG systems as provided to us by the sys-
tems’ authors; see (Novikova et al., 2017a) for more details.
The following systems are included in our set:

• LOLS (Lampouras & Vlachos, 2016), which is based

on imitation learning,

• RNNLG (Wen et al., 2015), a RNN-based system,

• TGen (Duˇsek & Jurˇc´ıˇcek, 2015), a system using

perceptron-guided incremental tree generation.

Their outputs are on the test parts of the following datasets
(see Table 1):

• BAGEL (Mairesse et al., 2010) – 404 short text seg-
ments (1–2 sentences) informing about restaurants,

• SFRest (Wen et al., 2015) – ca. 5,000 segments from
the restaurant information domain (including ques-
tions, conﬁrmations, greetings, etc.),

• SFHot (Wen et al., 2015) – a set from the hotel domain

similar in size and contents to SFRest.

During the crowdsourcing evaluation of the outputs, crowd

tions of the positive class probability.

Figure 2. Examples from our dataset. Ref = human reference (one selected), Out = system output to be rated. H = median human rating,
B = BLEU, M = METEOR, R = ROUGE, C = CIDEr, S4 = rating given by our system in the S4 conﬁguration. The metrics are shown
with normalised and rounded values (see Section 3.5) on top and the original, raw values underneath (in italics). The top example is
rated low by all metrics, our system is more accurate. The bottom one is rated low by humans but high by some metrics and our system.

workers were given two random system outputs along with
the source MRs and were asked to evaluate the absolute
overall quality of both outputs on a 1–6 Likert scale (see
Figure 2). We collected at least three ratings for each sys-
tem output; this resulted in more ratings for the same sen-
tence if two systems’ outputs were identical. The ratings
show a moderate inter-rater agreement of 0.45 (p < 0.001)
intra-class correlation coefﬁcient (Landis & Koch, 1977)
across all three datasets. We computed medians of the three
(or more) ratings in our experiments to ensure more consis-
tent ratings, which resulted in .5 ratings for some examples.
We keep this granularity throughout our experiments.

We use our data in a 5-fold cross-validation setting (three
training, one development, and one test part in each fold).
We also test our model on a subset of ratings for a particular
NLG system or dataset in order to assess its cross-system
and cross-domain performance (see Section 4).

3.2. Data Preprocessing

The source MRs in our data are variants of the dialogue acts
(DA) formalism (Young et al., 2010) – a shallow domain-
speciﬁc MR, consisting of the main DA type (hello, inform,
request) and an optional set of slots (attributes, such as food
or location) and values (e.g. Chinese for food or city cen-
tre for location). DAs are converted into sequences for our
system as a list of triplets “DA type – slot – value”, where
DA type may be repeated multiple times and/or special null
tokens are used if slots or values are not present (see Fig-
ure 1). The system outputs are tokenised and lowercased
for our purposes.

We use delexicalisation to prevent data sparsity, following
(Mairesse et al., 2010; Henderson et al., 2014; Wen et al.,
2015), where values of most DA slots (except unknown and
binary yes/no values) are replaced in both the source MRs
and the system outputs by slot placeholders – e.g. Chinese
is replaced by X-food (cf. also Figure 1).7

7Note that only values matching the source MR are delexi-
calised in the system outputs – if the outputs contain values not
present in the source MR, they are kept intact in the model input.

mentation procedures (varies slightly in different cross-validation
folds due to rounding).

3.3. Synthesising Additional Training Data

Following prior works in grammatical error correction (Ro-
zovskaya et al., 2012; Felice & Yuan, 2014; Xie et al.,
2016), we synthesise additional training instances by in-
troducing artiﬁcial errors: Given a training instance (source
MR, system output, and human rating), we generate a num-
ber of errors in the system output and lower the human rat-
ing accordingly. We use a set of basic heuristics mimicking
some of the observed system behaviour to introduce errors
into the system outputs:8

1. removing a word,

2. duplicating a word at its current position,

3. duplicating a word at a random position,

4. adding a random word from a dictionary learned from

all training system outputs,

5. replacing a word with a random word from the dictio-

nary.

We lower the original Likert scale rating of the instance by
1 for each generated error. If the original rating was 5.5 or
6, the rating is lowered to 4 with the ﬁrst introduced error
and by 1 for each additional error.

8To ensure that the errors truly are detrimental to the system
output quality, our rules prioritise content words, i.e. they do not
change articles or punctuation if other words are present. The
rules never remove the last word left in the system output.

Referenceless Quality Estimation for Natural Language Generation

We also experiment with using additional natural language
sentences where human ratings are not available – we
use human-authored references from the original training
datasets and assume that these would receive the maximum
rating of 6. We introduce artiﬁcial errors into the human
references in exactly the same way as with training system
outputs.

3.4. Model Training Parameters

We set the network parameters based on several exper-
iments performed on the development set of one of the
cross-validation folds (see Section 3.1).9

We train the network for 500 passes over the training data,
checking Pearson and Spearman correlations on the valida-
tion set after each pass (with equal importance). We keep
the conﬁguration that yielded the best correlations overall.
For setups using synthetic training data (see Section 3.3),
we ﬁrst perform 20 passes over all data including synthetic,
keeping the best parameters, and then proceed with 500
passes over the original data. To compensate for the ef-
fects of random network initialisation, all our results are
averaged over ﬁve runs with different initial random seeds
following Wen et al. (2015).

3.5. Evaluation Measures

Following practices from MT Quality estimation (Bojar
et al., 2016),10 we use Pearson’s correlation of the predicted
output quality with median human ratings as our primary
evaluation metric. Mean absolute error (MAE), root mean
squared error (RMSE), and Spearman’s rank correlation are
used as additional metrics.

We compare our results to some of the common word-
overlap metrics – BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002), METEOR
(Lavie & Agarwal, 2007), ROUGE-L (Lin, 2004), and
CIDEr (Vedantam et al., 2015) – normalised into the 1–6
range of the predicted human ratings and further rounded
to 0.5 steps.11 In addition, we also show the MAE/RMSE
values for a trivial constant baseline that always predicts
the overall average human rating (4.5).

4. Results

We test the following conﬁgurations that only differ in the
amount and nature of synthetic data used (see Section 3.3

9We use embedding size 300, learning rate 0.0001, dropout

probability 0.5, and two fully connected tanh layers (k = 2).

10See also the currently ongoing WMT‘17 Quality Esti-
mation shared task at http://www.statmt.org/wmt17/
quality-estimation-task.html.

11We used the Microsoft COCO Captions evaluation script to
obtain the metrics scores (Chen et al., 2015). Trials with non-
quantised metrics yielded very similar correlations.

and Table 2):

S1 Base system variant, with no synthetic data.

S2 Adding synthetic data – introducing artiﬁcial errors
into system outputs from the training portion of our
dataset (no additional human references are used).

S3 Same as previous, but with additional human refer-
ences from the training portion of our dataset (includ-
ing artiﬁcial errors; see Section 3.3).12

S4 As previous, but with additional human references
from the training parts of the respective source NLG
datasets (including artiﬁcial errors), i.e. references on
which the original NLG systems were trained.12

S5 As previous, but also includes additional human ref-
erences from the test portion of our dataset (including
artiﬁcial errors).13

S6 As previous, but also includes development parts of
the source NLG datasets (including artiﬁcial errors).

Synthetic data are never created from system outputs in the
test part of our dataset. Note that S1 and S2 only use the
original system outputs and their ratings, with no additional
human references. S3 and S4 use additional human ref-
erences (i.e. more in-domain data), but do not use human
references for the instances on which the system is tested.
S5 and S6 also use human references for test MRs, even if
not directly, and are thus not strictly referenceless.

4.1. Results using the whole dataset

The correlations and error values we obtained over the
whole data in a cross-validation setup are shown in Ta-
ble 3. The correlations only stay moderate for all system
variants. On the other hand, we can see that even the base
setup (S1) trained using less than 2,000 examples performs
better than all the word-overlap metrics in terms of all eval-
uation measures. Improvements in both Pearson and Spear-
man correlations are signiﬁcant according to the Williams
test (Williams, 1959; Kilickaya et al., 2017) (p < 0.01).
When comparing the base setup against the constant base-
line, MAE is lower but RMSE is slightly higher, which sug-
gests that our system does better on average but is prone to
occasional large errors.

The results also show that the performance can be im-
proved considerably by adding synthetic data, especially
after more than tripling the training data in S4 (Pearson cor-
relation improvements are statistically signiﬁcant in terms

12As mentioned in Section 3.1, our dataset only comprises the
test sets of the source NLG datasets, i.e. the additional human
references in S3 represent a portion of the source test sets. The
difference to S4 is the amount of the additional data (see Table 2).
13Note that the model still does not have any access at training

time to test NLG system outputs or their true ratings.

of the Williams test, p < 0.01). Using additional human
references for the test data seems to be helping further in S6
(the difference in Pearson correlation is statistically signif-
icant, p < 0.01): The additional references apparently pro-
vide more information even though the SFHot and SFRest
datasets have similar MRs (identical when delexicalised) in
training and test data (Lampouras & Vlachos, 2016).14 The
setups using larger synthetic data further improve MAE and
RMSE: S4 and S6 increase the margin against the constant
baseline up to ca. 0.1 in terms of MAE, and both are able
to surpass the constant baseline in terms of RMSE.

4.2. Cross-domain and Cross-System Training

Next, we test how well our approach generalises to new
systems and datasets and how much in-set data (same do-
main/system) is needed to obtain reasonable results. We
use the SFHot data as our test domain and LOLS as our
test system, and we treat the rest as out-of-set. We test
three different conﬁgurations:

C1 Training exclusively using a small amount of in-set
data (200 instances, 100 reserved for validation), test-
ing on the rest of the in-set.

C2 Training and validating exclusively on out-of-set data,
testing on the same part of the in-set as in C1 and C3.

C3 Training on the out-of-set data with a small amount
of in-set data (200 instances, 100 reserved for valida-
tion), testing on the rest of the in-set.

14Note that unlike in NLG systems training on SFHot and
SFRest, the identical MRs in training and test data do not allow
our system to only memorize the training data as the NLG out-
puts to be rated are distinct. However, the situation is not 100%
referenceless as the system may have been exposed to other NLG
outputs for the same MR. Our preliminary experiments suggest
that our systems can also handle lexicalised data well, without
any modiﬁcation (Pearson correlation 0.264–0.359 for S1–S6).

The results are shown in Tables 4 and 5, respectively.

The correlations of C2 suggest that while our network can
generalise across systems to some extent (if data fabrica-
tion is used), it does not generalise well across domains
without using in-domain training data. C1 and C3 conﬁgu-
ration results demonstrate that even small amounts of in-set
data help noticeably. However, if in-set data is used, addi-
tional out-of-set data does not improve the results in most
cases (C3 is mostly not signiﬁcantly better than the corre-
sponding C1).

Except for a few cross-system C2 conﬁgurations with low
amounts of synthetic data, all systems perform better than
word-overlap metrics. However, most setups are not able
to improve over the constant baseline in terms of MAE and
RMSE.

5. Related Work

This work is the ﬁrst NLG QE system to our knowledge;
the most related work in NLG is probably the system by
Dethlefs et al. (2014), which reranks NLG outputs by es-
timating their properties (such as colloquialism or polite-
ness) using various regression models. However, our work
is also related to QE research in other areas, such as MT
(Specia et al., 2010), dialogue systems (Lowe et al., 2017)
or grammatical error correction (Napoles et al., 2016). QE
is especially well researched for MT, where regular QE
shared tasks are organised (Callison-Burch et al., 2012; Bo-
jar et al., 2013; 2014; 2015; 2016).

Many of the past MT QE systems participating in the
shared tasks are based on Support Vector Regression (Spe-
cia et al., 2015; Bojar et al., 2014; 2015). Only in the past
year, NN-based solutions started to emerge. Patel & M
(2016) present a system based on RNN language models,
which focuses on predicting MT quality on the word level.

Kim & Lee (2016) estimate segment-level MT output qual-
ity using a bidirectional RNN over both source and output
sentences combined with a logistic prediction layer. They
pretrain their RNN on large MT training data.

Last year’s MT QE shared task systems achieve Pearson
correlations between 0.4–0.5, which is slightly higher than
our best results. However, the results are not directly com-
parable: First, we predict a Likert-scale assessment instead
of the number of required post-edits. Second, NLG datasets
are considerably smaller than corpora available for MT.
Third, we believe that QE for NLG is harder due to the
reasons outlined in Section 1.

6. Conclusions and Future Work

We presented the ﬁrst system for referenceless quality es-
timation of natural language generation outputs. All code
and data used here is available online at:

https://github.com/tuetschek/ratpred

In an evaluation spanning outputs of three different NLG

systems and three datasets, our system signiﬁcantly out-
performed four commonly used reference-based metrics. It
also improved over a constant baseline, which always pre-
dicts the mean human rating, in terms of MAE and RMSE.
The smaller RMSE improvement suggests that our sys-
tem is prone to occasional large errors. We have shown
that generating additional training data, e.g. by using NLG
training datasets and synthetic errors, signiﬁcantly im-
proves the system performance. While our system can gen-
eralise to unseen NLG systems in the same domain to some
extent, its cross-domain generalisation capability is poor.
However, very small amounts of in-domain/in-system data
improve performance notably.

In future work, we will explore improvements to our error
synthesising methods as well as changes to our network ar-
chitecture (bidirectional RNNs or convolutional NNs). We
also plan to focus on relative ranking of different NLG out-
puts for the same source MR or predicting the number of
post-edits required. We intend to use data collected within
the ongoing E2E NLG Challenge (Novikova et al., 2017b),
which promises greater diversity than current datasets.
