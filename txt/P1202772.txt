Abstract

Conventional solutions to automatic related
work summarization rely heavily on human-
engineered features. In this paper, we develop
a neural data-driven summarizer by leverag-
ing the seq2seq paradigm, in which a joint
context-driven attention mechanism is pro-
posed to measure the contextual relevance
within full texts and a heterogeneous bibliog-
raphy graph simultaneously. Our motivation
is to maintain the topic coherency between a
related work section and its target document,
where both the textual and graphic contexts
play a big role in characterizing the relation-
ship among scientiﬁc publications accurately.
Experimental results on a large dataset show
that our approach achieves a considerable im-
provement over a typical seq2seq summarizer
and ﬁve classical summarization baselines.

1 Introduction

In scientiﬁc ﬁelds, scholars need to contextualize
their contribution to help readers acquire an un-
derstanding of their research papers. For this pur-
pose, the related work section of an article serves
as a pivot to connect prior domain knowledge, in
which the innovation and superiority of current
work are displayed by a comparison with previ-
ous studies. While citation prediction can assist
in drafting a reference collection (Nallapati et al.,
2008), consuming all these papers is still a labo-
rious job, where authors must read every source
document carefully and locate the most relevant
content cautiously.

As a solution in saving authors’ efforts, au-
tomatic related work summarization is essen-
tially a topic-biased multi-document problem
(Cong and Kan, 2010), which relies heavily on
human-engineered features to retrieve snippets

from the references. Most recently, neural net-
works enable a data-driven architecture sequence-
to-sequence (seq2seq) for natural language gener-
ation (Bahdanau et al., 2014, 2016), where an en-
coder reads a sequence of words/sentences into
a context vector, from which a decoder yields a
sequence of speciﬁc outputs. Nonetheless, com-
pared to scenarios like machine translation with an
end-to-end nature, aligning a related work section
to its source documents is far more challenging.

To address the summarization alignment, for-
mer studies try to apply an attention mechanism
to measure the saliency/novelty of each candidate
word/sentence (Tan et al., 2017), with the aim of
locating the most representative content to retain
primary coverage. However, toward summarizing
a related work section, authors should be more cre-
ative when organizing text streams from the refer-
ence collection, where the selected content ought
to highlight the topic bias of current work, rather
than retell each reference in a compressed but bal-
anced fashion. This motivates us to introduce the
contextual relevance and characterize the relation-
ship among scientiﬁc publications accurately.

Generally speaking, for a pair of documents, a
larger lexical overlap often implies a higher sim-
ilarity in their research backgrounds. Yet such a
hypothesis is not always true when sampling con-
tent from multiple relevant topics. Take “DSSM”1
as an example, from viewpoint of the abstract sim-
ilarity, those references investigating “Information
Retrieval”, “Latent Semantic Model” or “Click-
through Data Mining” could be of more impor-
tance in correlation and should be greatly sampled
for the related work section. But in reality, this ar-
ticle spends a bit larger chunk of texts (about 58%)
to elaborate “Deep Learning” during the litera-
ture review, which is quite difﬁcult for machines

1Learning deep structured semantic models for web

search using clickthrough data (Huang et al., 2013)

to grasp the contextual relevance therein. In addi-
tion, other situations like emerging new concepts
also suffer from the terminology variation or para-
phrasing in varying degrees.

In this study, we utilize a heterogeneous bibli-
ography graph to embody the relationship within a
scalable scholarly database. Over the recent past,
there is a surge of interest in exploiting diverse re-
lations to analyze bibliometrics, ranging from lit-
erature recommendation (Yu et al., 2015) to topic
evolvement (Jensen et al., 2016).
In a graphical
sense,
interconnected papers transfer the credit
among each other directly/indirectly through var-
ious patterns, such as paper citation, author col-
laboration, keyword association and releasing on
series of venues, which constitutes the graphic
context for outlining concerned topics. Unfortu-
nately, a variety of edge types may pollute the in-
formation inquiry, where a slice of edges are not
so important as the others on sampling content.
Meanwhile, most existing solutions in mining het-
erogeneous graphs depend on the human supervi-
sion, e.g., hyperedge (Bu et al., 2010) and metap-
ath (Swami et al., 2017). This is usually not easy
to access due to the complexity of graph schemas.
Our contribution is threefold: First, we explore
the edge-type usefulness distribution (EUD) on
a heterogeneous bibliography graph, which en-
ables the relationship discovery (between any pair
of papers) for sampling the interested informa-
tion. Second, we develop a novel seq2seq summa-
rizer for the automatic related work summariza-
tion, where a joint context-driven attention mech-
anism is proposed to measure the contextual rel-
evance within both textual and graphic contexts.
Third, we conduct experiments on 8,080 papers
with native related work sections, and experimen-
tal results show that our approach outperforms
a typical seq2seq summarizer and ﬁve classical
summarization baselines signiﬁcantly.

2 Related Work

This study touches on several strands of research
within automatic related work summarization and
seq2seq summarizer as follows.

The idea of creating a related work section au-
tomatically is pioneered by Cong and Kan (2010)
who design two rule-based strategies to extract
sentences for general and detailed topics respec-
tively.
Subsequently, Hu and Wan (2014) ex-
ploit probabilistic latent semantic indexing to

split candidate texts into different
parts,
then apply several regression models to
learn the importance of each sentence. Similarly,
Widyantoro and Amin (2014) transform the sum-
marization problem into classifying rhetorical cat-
egories of sentences, where each sentence is rep-
resented as a feature vector containing word fre-
quency, sentence length and etc. Most recently,
Chen and Hai (2016) construct a graph of repre-
sentative keywords, in which a minimum steiner
tree is ﬁgured out to guide the summarization as

to traditional summaries,
the automatic related
work summarization receives less concerns over
the past. However, these existing solutions can-
not work without manual intervention, which lim-
its the application scale to an extremely small size
(see Table 1).

The earliest seq2seq summarizer stems from
Rush et al. (2015) which utilizes a feed-forward
network for compressing sentences, and later
is expanded by Chopra et al. (2016) with a re-
current neural network (RNN). On this basis,
Nallapati et al. (2016a,c) and Chen et al. (2016)
both present a set of RNN-based models to ad-
dress various aspects of abstractive summariza-
tion. Typically, Cheng and Lapata (2016) pro-
pose a general seq2seq summarizer, where an
encoder learns the representation of documents
while a decoder generates each word/sentence us-
ing an attention mechanism. With further re-
search, Nallapati et al. (2016b) extend the sen-
tence compression by trying a hierarchical atten-
tion architecture and a limited vocabulary during
the decoding phase. Next, Narayan et al. (2017)
leverage the side information as an attention cue
to locate focus regions for summaries. Recently,
inspired by PageRank, Tan et al. (2017) introduce
a graph-based attention mechanism to tackle the
saliency problem. Nonetheless, these methods all
discuss the single-document scenario, which is far
from the nature of automatic related work summa-
rization.

In this study, derived from the general seq2seq
summarizer of Cheng and Lapata (2016), we pro-
pose a joint context-driven attention mechanism to
measure the contextual relevance within full texts
and a heterogeneous bibliography graph simulta-
neously. To our best knowledge, we make the ﬁrst
attempt to develop a neural data-driven solution
for the automatic related work summarization, and
the practice of using the joint context as an atten-
tion cue is also less explored to date. Besides, this
study is launched on a dataset with up to 8,080 pa-
pers, which is much greater than previous studies
and makes our results more convincing.

Since

summarization

via word-by-
word generation is not mature
at present
(Cheng and Lapata, 2016; Nallapati et al., 2016b;
Tan et al., 2017), we adopt the extractive senten-
tial fashion for our summarizer, where a related
work section is created by extracting and linking
sentences from a reference collection. Meanwhile,
this study follows the mode of Cong and Kan
(2010) who assume that the collection is given as
part of the input, and do not consider the citation
sentences of each reference.

3 Methodology

3.1 Problem Formulation

To adapt the seq2seq paradigm, we formulate the
automatic related work summarization into a se-
quential text generation problem as follows.

Given an unedited paper t (target document)
and its n-size reference collection Rt = {rt
1:n},
we draw up a related work section for t by select-
ing sentences from Rt. To be speciﬁc, each refer-
ence (source document) will be traversed one time
sequentially, and without loss of generality, in the
descending order of their signiﬁcance to t. Con-
sequently, all sentences to be selected are concate-
nated into an m-length sequence St = {st
1:m} to
feed the summarizer. For each candidate sentence
j , once being visited, a label yt
st
j ∈ {0, 1} will
be determined synchronously based on whether
or not this sentence should be covered into the
output. Our objective is to maximize the log-
likelihood probability of observed labels Yt =
{yt
1:m} under Rt, St and summarizer parameters
θ, as shown below.

Prior works have illustrated that one of the most
promising channels for information recommen-
dation is the community network (Guo and Liu,
2015).
In this study, we verify this hypothesis
toward the content sampling of scientiﬁc summa-
rization, by investigating heterogeneous relations
among different kinds of objects such as papers,
authors, keywords and venues.

z

For measuring the relationship among scien-
tiﬁc publications, we introduce a directed graph
G = (V, E) to contain various bibliographical con-
nections, as shown in Figure 1, which involves
four objects and ten edge types in total. Each edge
ej,i ∈ E is assigned a value π(ej,i)
∈ [0, 1] to indi-
cate the transition probability between two nodes
vj, vi ∈ V, where π(ej,i) ∈ R returns the un-
known edge-type usefulness of ej,i, and z ∈ R is
a normalizing weight. For most of edge types, we
model the weight as one divided by the number
of outgoing links of the same kind. But regard-
ing the “contribution” category, the weight mod-
eling is accomplished by PageRank with Priors
(White and Smyth, 2003). Note that different edge
types usually take very uneven importance in one
particular task (Yu et al., 2015), and it is quite dif-
ﬁcult to enable the classical heterogeneous graph
mining without expert deﬁned paths for random
walk (Bu et al., 2010; Swami et al., 2017).

In this study, we propose an unsupervised ap-
proach to capture the connectivity diversity, by
introducing an optimal EUD for navigating ran-
dom walkers on the heterogeneous bibliography
graph. Given a target document t, the optimized

usefulness assignment can help those walkers lock
a top-n recommendation ¯Rt to best match the ref-
erence collection Rt, as shown in Eq. 2. On
this basis, a well-performing algorithm node2vec
(Grover and Leskovec, 2016) is adopted to con-
duct an unsupervised random walk to vectorize ev-
ery node ∀v∗ ∈ V into a d-dimensional embed-
ding ϕ(v∗) ∈ Rd so that any edge ∀e∗ ∈ E can
be calculated therefrom. Speciﬁcally, we employ
evolutionary algorithm (EA) to tune the EUD,
which enjoys advantages over conventional gradi-
ent methods in both convergence speed and accu-
racy.

EA Setup We use an array of real numbers x1:10

on graph to infer the relative importance of each

tion is applied to judge how well this EUD satis-

EA Operator We choose the operator from dif-

generate offsprings for each individual. The basic
idea is to utilize the difference between different
individuals to disturb each trial object. First, three
distinct individuals xr1

1:10 are sampled
randomly from current population to create a vari-
1:10, as shown in Eq. 4, where f ∈ R in-

1:10 is crossed
1:10 to build a hybrid one xhyb
with a trial object xtri

as Eq. 5, in which c ∈ [0, 1] denotes the crossover
factor and u ∈ [0, 1] represents an uniform random
number. At last, the ﬁtnesses of xtri
1:10 are
compared, and the better one will be saved as the
offspring into a new round of evolution.

3.3 Neural Extractive Summarization

As Figure 2 shows, we model our seq2seq summa-
rizer with a hierarchical encoder and an attention-
based decoder, as described below.
Hierarchical Encoder Our encoder consists of
two major layers, namely a convolutional neu-
ral network (CNN) and a long-short-term mem-
ory (LSTM)-based RNN. Speciﬁcally, the CNN
deals with word-level texts to derive sentence-
level meanings, which are then taken as inputs to
the RNN for handling longer-range dependency
within lager units like a paragraph and even a
whole paper. This conforms to the nature of docu-
ment that is composed from words, sentences and
higher levels of abstraction (Narayan et al., 2017).

dimensional embedding φ(wt
ous studies have illustrated the strength of CNN
in presenting sentences, because of its capability
to learn compressed expressions and address sen-
tences with variable lengths (Kim, 2014). First, a
convolution kernel k ∈ Rd×q×d is applied to each
possible window of q words to construct a list of
feature maps as:

Consider a sentence of p words st

where b ∈ Rd denotes the bias term. Next, max-
over-time pooling (Collobert et al., 2011) is per-
formed on all generated features to obtain the sen-
tence embedding as:

φ(st

j ) = max

where [i, :] denotes the i-th row of matrix. Given
a sequence of sentences St = {st
1:m}, we then
take the RNN to yield an equal-length array of
hidden states, in which LSTM has proved to al-
leviate the vanishing gradient problem when train-
ing long sequences (Hochreiter and Schmidhuber,
1997). Each hidden state can be viewed as a lo-
cal representation with focusing on current and
former sentences together, which is updated as:

information inside different n-grams. As Figure
2 (bottom) shows, the sentence st
j involves six
words, and two kernels of widths two (orange) and
three (green) abstract a set of ﬁve and four fea-
ture maps respectively. Meanwhile, since rhetori-
cal structure theory (Mann and Thompson, 2009)
points out that association must exist in any two
parts of coherent texts, RNN is only applicable to
manage the sentence relation within a single doc-
ument, because we cannot expect the dependency
between two sections from different references.

Attention-based Decoder Our decoder
labels
each sentence st
j as 0/1 sequentially, according to
whether it is salient or novel enough, plus if rele-
vant to the target document t or not. As shown in
Figure 2 (top), the binary decision yt
j is made by
j and the context vector ¯ht
both the hidden state ht
j
from an attention mechanism (grey background).
In particular, this attention (red dash line) is acted
as an intermediate stage to determine which sen-
tences to highlight so as to provide the contextual
information for current decision (Bahdanau et al.,
2014). Given Ht = {ht
1:m}, this decoder returns

the probability of yt

Apart from saliency and novelty two traditional
attention factors (Chen et al., 2016; Tan et al.,
2017), we focus on the contextual relevance within
both textual and graphic contexts to distinguish the
relationship from near to far, as shown in Eq. 10
and Eq. 11. To be speciﬁc: 1) htT

concretely, W∗ ∈ Rd characterizes the learnable
matrix, φ(t) returns the average of hidden states
from t, ϕ(t) and ϕ(ht

dings of both t and the source document that ht
i
belongs to respectively. Note that φ(·) and ϕ(·)
represent two distinct embedding spaces, where
the former reﬂects the lexical collocations of cor-
pus, and the latter embodies the connectivity pat-
terns of associated graph.

The basic idea behind our attention mechanism
if a supporting sentence more re-
is as follows:
sembles a candidate one, or overlaps less with the
dynamic output, or is more relevant to the target
document, then it can provide more contextual in-
formation to facilitate current decision on being
extracted or not, thereby taking a higher weight in
the generated context vector. This innovative at-
tention will guide our goal related work section to
maximize the representativeness of selected sen-
tences (saliency & novelty), while minimizing the
semantic distance to the target document (rele-
vance). This is consistent with the way that schol-
ars consume a reference collection, with the min-
max objective in their minds.

4 Experiment

4.1 Experimental Setup

This section presents the experimental setup for
assessing our approach, including 1) dataset used
for training and testing, 2) implementation details,
3) contrast methods and evaluation metrics.
Dataset We conduct experiments on a dataset2
created from the ACM digital library, where meta-
data and full texts are derived from PDF ﬁles. To
be detailed, this dataset includes 371,891 papers,

the

779,810 authors, 9,204 keywords and 807 venues
in total. Note that we ignore the keyword with
frequency below a certain threshold, and adopt
greedy matching of Guo et al. (2013) to generate
pseudo keywords for papers lacking topic descrip-
tions. For each target document, the references
are traversed by the descending order of the cited
number in related work section (primary) and in
full paper (secondary) successively. We ﬁrst ap-
ply a series of pre-processings such as lowercasing
and stemming to standardize candidate sentences,
then remove those which are too short/long (< 7
or > 80 words). On this basis, a total of 8,080
papers are selected to evaluate our approach, each
containing more than 15 references found in the
dataset and a related work section of at least 500
words. But as for the heterogeneous bibliography
graph, all source data have to be imported to en-
sure the structural integrity of communities. Be-
sides, this graph should be constructed year-by-
year to preclude the effect of later publications on
earlier ones.

Implementation We use Tensorﬂow for imple-
mentation, where both the dimensions of embed-
ding and hidden state are equally 128. For the
CNN, word2vec (Mikolov et al., 2013) is utilized
to initialize the word embeddings, which can be
further tuned during the training phase. Mean-
while, we follow the work of Kim (2014) to ap-
ply a list of kernels with widths {3, 4, 5}. As for
the RNN, each LSTM module is set to one single
layer, and all input documents are padded to the
same length, along with a mark to indicate the real
number of sentences. Based on these settings, we
train our summarizer using Adam with the default
in Kingma and Ba (2014), and perform mini-batch
cross-entropy training with a batch of one target
document for 20 epochs.

To create training data for our summarizer, each
reference needs to be annotated with the ground
i.e., candidate sentences are
truth in advance,
tagged with 0/1 for indicating summary-worthy or
not. Speciﬁcally, we follow a heuristic practice
of Cao et al. (2016) and Nallapati et al. (2016b) to
compute ROUGE-2 score (Lin and Hovy, 2003)
for each sentence, in terms of the native related
work sections (gold standards). Next, those sen-
tences with high scores are chosen as the positive
samples, and the rest as the negative ones, such
that the total score of selected sentences is max-
imized with respect to the gold standard. As for

testing, we relax the number of sentences to be se-
lected, and focus on the classiﬁcation probability
from Eq. 8. In this study, cross validation is ap-
plied to split the dataset into ten parts equally at
random, in which nine are used for training and
the other one for testing.
Evaluation We adopt
the widely used toolkit
ROUGE (Lin and Hovy, 2003) to evaluate the
summarization performance automatically. In par-
ticular, we report ROUGE-1 and ROUGE-2 (uni-
gram and bigram overlapping) as a way to assess
the informativeness, and ROUGE-L (the longest
common subsequence) as a means to assess the
ﬂuency, in terms of ﬁxed bytes of gold standards.

To validate the proposed attention mecha-
nism, we compare our approach (denoted as
P.S+N+Rteg+EUD) against six variants, including: 1)
P.void: a plain seq2seq summarizer without atten-
tions; 2) P.S: use the saliency as an only atten-
leverage both the saliency
tion factor; 3) P.S+N:
and novelty; 4) P.S+N+Rt: incorporate the relevance
from the textual context; 5) P.S+N+Rtog: gain the
relevance from the graphic context of a homo-
geneous citation graph; 6) P.S+N+Rteg: utilize the
heterogeneous bibliography graph, but with each
edge type the same usefulness.

In addition, we also select six representative
summarization methods as a benchmark group.
The ﬁrst one is the general seq2seq summarizer
by Cheng and Lapata (2016), denoted as Pointer-
Net, which employs an attention mechanism to ex-
tract sentences directly after reading them. Fol-
lowing are ﬁve classical generic solutions, includ-
ing: 1) Luhn (Luhn, 1958): a heuristic summa-
rization based on word frequency and distribu-
tion; 2) MMR (Carbonell and Goldstein, 1998): a
diversity-based re-ranking to produce summaries;
3) LexRank (Erkan et al., 2004): a graph-based
summary technique inspired by PageRank and
HITS; 4) SumBasic (Nenkova and Vanderwende,
2005): a frequency-based summarizer with du-
plication removal; 5) NltkSum (Acanfora et al.,
2014): a natural language tookit (NLTK)-based
implementation for summarization.

For clarity, Luhn, LexRank and SumBa-
sic are analogous to the work of Hu and Wan
(2014) which extracts sentences scoring the high-
est
and they are also con-
trasted in the latest studies on neural summariz-
ers (Chen et al., 2016; Tan et al., 2017). Mean-
while, MMR often serves as a part/post-processing

in signiﬁcance,

of existing techniques to avoid the redundancy
(Cohan and Goharian, 2017), and we introduce
NltkSum to investigate the impact of grammat-
ical/semantic analysis to the automatic related
work summarization. Note that former studies
specially for this task require extensive human in-
volvements (see Table 1), thus we cannot apply
them to such a large dataset of this study.

4.2 Results and Discussion

Table 2 reports the evaluation comparison over
ROUGE metrics. From the top half, all scores ap-
pear a gradual upward trend with incorporation of
saliency, novelty, relevance (from both textual and
graphic contexts) and EUD into consideration one
after another, which demonstrates the validity of
our attention mechanism for summarizing related
work sections. To be speciﬁc, we further reach the
following conclusions:

1) P.void vs. P.S vs. P.S+N: Both saliency and
novelty are two effective factors to locate the re-
quired content for summaries, which is consistent
with prior studies.

2) P.S+N vs. P.S+N+Rt: Contextual relevance does
contribute to address the alignment between a re-
lated work section and its source documents.

3) P.S+N+Rt vs. P.S+N+Rtog: Textual context alone
cannot provide entire evidence to characterize the
relationship among scientiﬁc publications exactly.
4) P.S+N+Rtog vs. P.S+N+Rteg: Heterogeneous bib-
liography graph involves richer contextual infor-
mation than a homogeneous citation graph.

5) P.S+N+Rteg vs. P.S+N+Rteg+EUD: EUD plays an
indispensable role in organizing accurate contex-
tual relevance on a heterogeneous graph.

It can
be seen that only after adding the relevance es-
pecially that from the graphic context into atten-
tions, our summarizer can correctly sample the
content from “Deep Learning” (yellow line), and
eliminate that originated from “Other Sources” by
a big margin (green line). As this example falls
into the methodology transferring, a host of its in-
volved word collocations are not idiomatic com-
binations yet, such as “Deep Neural Network” co-
occurs with “Clickthrough Data” that is more fre-
quently related to “Latent Semantic Analysis” at
that time, which results in a somewhat biased tex-
tual context. By contrast, the graphic context will
suffer less from this bias because it characterizes
the connectivity patterns (real-time setup) instead
of n-gram statistics, thus offering a more robust
measure for the contextual relevance.

The bottom half of Table 2 illustrates the superi-
ority of our approach over six representative sum-
marization methods. Above all, Luhn, LexRank
and MMR three summarizers that simply exploit
shallow text features (word frequency and asso-
ciated sentence similarity) to measure either sig-
niﬁcance or redundancy fall far behind the plain
variant P.void, which partly reﬂects the strength
of seq2seq paradigm in summarizing a related
work section. Second, with combination of sig-
niﬁcance and redundancy, SumBasic achieves a
drastic increase on ROUGE-1 and a mild raise on

ROUGE-2 respectively, but it still cannot improve
ROUGE-L marginally. This is because simple
text statistics cannot present deeper levels of natu-
ral language understanding to catch larger-grained
units of co-occurrence. Third, NltkSum beneﬁts
from a NLTK library so as to access grammati-
cal/semantic supports, thereby having the best in-
formativeness (ROUGE-1 and ROUGE-2) among
the ﬁve generic baselines, and meanwhile a com-
parable ﬂuency (ROUGE-L) with our approach.
Finally, as a deep learning solution, although
PointerNet takes both hidden states and previously
labeled sentences into account, at each decoding
step it focuses on only current and just one pre-
vious sentences, lacking a comprehensive consid-
eration on saliency, novelty and more importantly
the contextual relevance (< P.S+N).

To better verify the summarization perfor-
mance, we also conduct a human evaluation on
35 papers containing more than 30 references in
the dataset. We assign a number of raters to com-
pare each generated related work section against
the gold standard, and judge by three independent
aspects as: 1) How compliant is the related work
section to the target document? 2) How intuitive
is the related work section for readers to grasp the
key content? 3) How useful is the related work
section for researchers to prepare their ﬁnal liter-
ature reviews? Note that we do not allow any ties
during the comparison, and each property is as-
sessed with a 5-point scale of 1 (worst) to 5 (best).
Table 3 displays how often raters rank each
summarizer as the 1st, 2nd and so on, in terms of

best-to-worst. Speciﬁcally, our approach comes
the 1st on 40% of the time, which is followed
by NltkSum that is considered the best on 21%
of the time (almost half of ours), and Pointer-
Net with quite equal proportions on each rank-
ing. Furthermore, the other four summarizers ac-
count for obviously lower ratings in general. To
attain the statistical signiﬁcance, one-way analy-
sis of variance (ANOVA) is performed on the ob-
tained ratings, and the results show that our ap-
proach is better than all six contrast methods sig-
niﬁcantly (p < 0.01), which means that the con-
clusion drawn by Table 2 is sustained.

5 Conclusion

In this paper, we highlight the contextual rele-
vance for the automatic related work summariza-
tion, and analyze the graphic context to charac-
terize the relationship among scientiﬁc publica-
tions accurately. We develop a neural data-driven
summarizer by leveraging the seq2seq paradigm,
where a joint context-driven attention mechanism
is proposed to measure the contextual relevance
within full texts and a heterogeneous bibliogra-
phy graph simultaneously. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the validity of the proposed attention
mechanism, and the superiority of our approach
over six representative summarization baselines.

In future work, an appealing direction is to or-
ganize the selected sentences in a logical fash-
ion, e.g., by leveraging a topic hierarchy tree to
determine the arrangement of the related work
section (Cong and Kan, 2010). We also would
like to take the citation sentences of each refer-
ence into consideration, which is another concise
and universal data source for scientiﬁc summariza-
tion (Chen and Hai, 2016; Cohan and Goharian,
2017). At the end of this paper, we believe that
extractive methods are by no means the ﬁnal so-
lutions for literature review generation due to pla-

giarism concerns, and we are going to put forward
a fully abstractive version in further studies.
