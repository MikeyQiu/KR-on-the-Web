Abstract

Offensive language has an impact across so-
ciety. The use of social media has aggravated
this issue among online users, causing suicides
in the worst cases. For this reason, it is impor-
tant to develop systems capable of identifying
and detecting offensive language in text auto-
matically. In this paper, we developed a sys-
tem to classify offensive tweets as part of our
participation in SemEval-2019 Task 6: Offen-
sEval. Our main contribution is the integra-
tion of lexical features in the classiﬁcation us-
ing the SVM algorithm.

Introduction

In recent years, with the emergence of social me-
dia, the user-generated content on the Web has
grown exponentially. This content has the poten-
tial to be transmitted quickly, reaching anywhere
in the world in a matter of seconds. Due to the ex-
change of ideas between users, we ﬁnd not only
positive comments, but also a wide diffusion of
aggressive and potentially harmful content. Con-
sequently, this type of remarks affects millions of
online users.
In fact, it has been reported that
these incidents have not only created mental and
psychological agony to the online users, but have
forced people to deactivate their accounts and, in
severe cases like cyberbullying, to commit sui-
cides (Hinduja and Patchin, 2018). One of the
strategies used to deal with aggressive behavior in
social media is to monitor or report this type of
content. However, this strategy is not entirely fea-
sible due to the huge amount of data that is gen-
erated daily by users. Therefore, it is necessary to
develop systems capable of identifying this type of
content on the Web.

In order to tackle this problem, ﬁrstly it is im-
portant to deﬁne the toxic language. The toxic lan-
guage can be broadly divided into two categories:

hate speech and offensive language (Cheng, 2007;
Davidson et al., 2017; Gaydhani et al., 2018). Ac-
cording to Cambridge Dictionary, hate speech is
deﬁned as “public speech that expresses hate or
encourages violence towards a person or group
based on something such as race, religion, sex, or
sexual orientation”. Offensive language is deﬁned
as the text which uses hurtful, derogatory or ob-
scene terms made by one person to another person.
In this paper, we present the system we devel-
oped as part of our participation in SemEval-2019
Task 6 OffensEval: Identifying and Categorizing
Offensive Language in Social Media) (Zampieri
et al., 2019b). In particular, we participated in sub-
task A: Offensive language identiﬁcation. It is a
binary classiﬁcation task and consists of identify-
ing if a post contains or not offense or profanity
language.

The rest of the paper is structured as follows. In
Section 2, we explain the data used in our meth-
ods. Section 3 introduces the lexical resources
used for this work. Section 4 presents the details
of the proposed systems. In Section 5, we discuss
the analysis and evaluation results for our system.
We conclude in Section 6 with remarks on future
work.

2 Data

To run our experiments, we used the English
dataset provided by the organizers in SemEval19
Task 6 OffensEval: Identifying and Categorizing
Offensive Language in Social Media (Zampieri
et al., 2019a).

The datasets contain tweets with ﬁve ﬁelds.
Each tweet comprises an identiﬁer (id), the tweet
text (tweet), ﬁeld for subtask A (subtask a), ﬁeld
for subtask B (subtask b) and ﬁeld for subtask C
(subtask c). Since we have only participated in
sub-task A, we are interested in the ﬁelds id, tweet

and subtask a.

In sub-task A, we are interested in the identiﬁca-
tion of offensive tweets and tweets containing any
form of (untargeted) profanity.
In this sub-task,
there are 2 categories in which the tweet could be
classiﬁed:

(NOT) Not Offensive - This post does not con-

tain offense or profanity.

(OFF) Offensive - This post contains offensive
language or a targeted (veiled or direct) offense.
In the annotation, this category includes insults,
threats, and posts containing profane language and
swear words.

During pre-evaluation period, we trained our
models on the train set, and evaluated our differ-
ent approaches on the trial set. During evaluation
period, we trained our models on the train and trial
sets, and tested the model on the test set. Table 1
shows the number of tweets per class for English
language used in our experiments.

3 Resources

For this subtask A, we used different lexicons that
we explain in detail below.

VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEn-
timent Reasoner) (Gilbert, 2014). The VADER
sentiment lexicon is a rule-based sentiment anal-
ysis tool. This is sensitive both to the polarity
and the intensity of sentiments expressed in social
media contexts, and is also generally applicable
to sentiment analysis in other domains. VADER
has been validated by multiple independent human
judges. The tool return four values: positive, neg-
ative, neutral and compound. The ﬁrst three scores
represent the proportion of text that falls in these
categories. The compound score is computed by
summing the valence scores of each word in the
lexicon, adjusted according to the rules, and then
normalized between -1 (most extreme negative)
and +1 (most extreme positive).

Offensive/Profane Word List

(von Ahn,
2009). A list of 1,384 English terms (unigrams and
bigrams) that could be found offensive. The list

contains some words that many people won’t ﬁnd
offensive, but it’s a good start for anybody wanting
to detect offensive or profane terms.

4 System Description

In this section, we describe the systems devel-
oped for the subtask A in OffensEval task. During
our experiments, scikit-learn machine learning in
Python library (Pedregosa et al., 2011) was used
for benchmarking. A general scheme of the sys-
tem can be seen in Figure 1.

Figure 1: Systems architecture.

4.1 Data Preprocessing

In ﬁrst place, we preprocessed the corpus of tweets
provided by the organizers. We applied the fol-
lowing preprocessing steps: the documents were
tokenized using NLTK, the URLs and mentions
users are removed and all letters were converted
to lower-case.

4.2 Feature Extractor

Converting sentences into feature vectors is a focal
task of supervised learning based sentiment analy-
sis. Therefore, the features we chose in our system
can be divided into two parts: statistic features and
lexical features.

• Statistic features. We employed the features
that usually perform well in text classiﬁca-
tion: Term Frequency (TF) taking into ac-
count unigrams.

• Lexical features. As we explained in Section
3, we used two lexicons to obtain our features
in the following way:

Table 2: System test results per class in subtask A of
OffensEval task.

1. VaderSentiment. We use the senti-
ment.vader module1 provided by the
Natural Language Toolkit
(NLTK).
With this module, we analyze each
sentence and we obtained a vector
of
negative sentiment,
positive sentiment, neutral sentiment
and compound polarity.

four scores:

2. Offensive/Profane Word List. We
checked the presence of each word of
offensive/profane word list in the tweet
and if it exists we assigned 1 as Con-
ﬁdence Value (CV). Then, we summed
the CV of all the words ﬁnding in the
tweet and this value is divided for the
total number of words of tweet. As a re-
sult, we obtained a parameter that will
be used as a feature applied for the clas-
siﬁer.

4.3 Classiﬁer

The concatenation of the features described before
are applied for the classiﬁcation using the SVM
algorithm. We selected the Linear SVM formu-
lation, known as C-SVC and the value of the C
parameter was 1.0.

5 Analysis of results

During the pre-evaluation phase we carried out
several experiments and the best experiment were
taken into account for the evaluation phase. The
system has been evaluated using the ofﬁcial com-
petition metric, the macro-averaged F1-score. The
metric has been computed as follows:

Macro-F1 =

2 ∗ Macro-Prec ∗ Macro-Rec
Macro-Prec + Macro-Rec

(1)

The results of our participation in the subtask A
of OffensEval task during the evaluation phase can
be seen in Table 2.

Table 3: System Results per participating team in sub-
task A of OffensEval task.

In relation to our results, it should be noted that
we achieve better score in case of the class NOT
offensive (F1: 0.88). However, our system is not
able to classify well the OFF class (F1: 0.56). This
issue may be due to overtraining for the NOT class
since as we can see in the Table 1 of Section 2,
around 67% of the total tweets belong to that class
in the training set in comparison to 33% of OFF
class.

With respect to other users, we were ranked in

the 68th position as can be seen in Table 3.

6 Conclusions and Future Work

In this paper, we present the system we have devel-
oped as part of our participation in SemEval-2019
Task 6: OffensEval: Identifying and Categorizing
Offensive Language in Social Media. Speciﬁcally,
we have participated in subtask A. To solve this
task, we have developed a classiﬁer system based
on SVM incorporating lexical features from a po-
larity lexicon and a offensive/profane word list.

Our next study will focus on exploring more
features from lexicons because in SemEval-2018
Task 1 (Mohammad et al., 2018), most of the top-
performing teams relied on features derived from
existing affective lexicons. Also, we will continue
working on classifying offensive tweets because
today it is a very important task due to the large
amount of offensive data generated by users on
the Web and we need to prevent the serious conse-
quences it can have on other users.
