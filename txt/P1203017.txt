Abstract
In recent years, temporal tagging, i.e., the extraction and normalization of temporal expressions, has become a vibrant research area.
Several tools have been made available, and new strategies have been developed. Due to domain-speciﬁc challenges, evaluations of new
methods should be performed on diverse text types. Despite signiﬁcant efforts towards multilinguality in the context of temporal tagging,
for all languages except English, annotated corpora exist only for a single domain. In the case of German, for example, only a narrative-
style corpus has been manually annotated so far, thus no evaluations of German temporal tagging performance on news articles can be
made. In this paper, we present KRAUTS, a new German temporally annotated corpus containing two subsets of news documents:
articles from the daily newspaper DOLOMITEN and from the weekly newspaper DIE ZEIT. Overall, the corpus contains 192 documents
with 1,140 annotated temporal expressions, and has been made publicly available to further boost research in temporal tagging.

Keywords: temporal tagging, corpus annotation, TIMEX3

Introduction

Temporal tagging – the extraction and normalization of
temporal expressions from texts – is an important task
towards improved natural language understanding. Once
temporal expressions have been detected in a text, their se-
mantics can be assigned to them in a standard format so
that applications can exploit not only the surface forms
of temporal expressions, but also their meaning. For in-
stance, applications in event / timeline extraction (Minard et
al., 2015; Cornegruta and Vlachos, 2016; Spitz and Gertz,
2016), question answering (Llorens et al., 2015) and (tem-
poral) information retrieval (Kanhabua et al., 2015) can ex-
ploit temporal tagging output. Thus, temporal tagging has
become a vibrant research area, and several new tempo-
ral taggers have been made available and new strategies
have been developed. However, as was shown in pre-
vious work (Mazur and Dale, 2010; Str¨otgen and Gertz,
2013; Bethard et al., 2016; Tabassum et al., 2016), differ-
ent types of documents pose different challenges for tempo-
ral tagging such that domain-sensitive normalization strate-
gies are required (Str¨otgen and Gertz, 2016). To judge the
performance of temporal taggers and new methods, evalu-
ations need to be performed on diverse text types, e.g., on
news articles and narrative-style Wikipedia documents.
In contrast to many natural language processing tasks, there
has also been some effort towards multilinguality in the
context of temporal tagging, e.g., research competitions
were organized not only for English but covered further lan-
guages such as Spanish and Italian (Verhagen et al., 2010;
Caselli et al., 2014). Despite its importance, German has
not been part of any of these challenges so far. In addition,
HeidelTime is the only publicly available temporal tagger
for German, and only narrative style corpora have been
manually annotated so far. Thus, no proper evaluations of
German temporal tagging performance on news articles can
be carried out. Therefore, HeidelTime’s German temporal
tagging quality has only been evaluated on narrative texts
using the WikiWarsDE and AncientTimes corpora.

In this paper, we present our effort
in developing
KRAUTS, a new temporally annotated corpus in German
containing two subsets of news documents: articles from
the daily newspaper DOLOMITEN and from the weekly
newspaper DIE ZEIT. For annotating temporal expressions
in the corpus, we developed annotation guidelines for Ger-
man temporal tagging by using the guidelines deﬁned for
Italian (Caselli and Sprugnoli, 2015) as a starting point.
Overall, the corpus contains 192 documents with 1,140 an-
notated temporal expressions, and the corpus as well as the
annotation guidelines have been made publicly available to
further boost research in temporal tagging.1

2. Related Work
The task of temporal processing has gained interest in re-
cent years, in particular thanks to the TempEval tasks at
SemEval (Verhagen et al., 2007; Verhagen et al., 2010; Uz-
Zaman et al., 2013; Llorens et al., 2015; Bethard et al.,
2016). Temporal tagging is a subtask of temporal pro-
cessing and consists of the identiﬁcation of temporal ex-
pressions in texts and their normalization to some stan-
dard format. Str¨otgen and Gertz (2016) present a complete
overview of the task as well as a survey of the resources,
tools, etc. They focus on the description of domain-
sensitive temporal tagging and multilingual taggers.
The annotation of temporal expressions follows in most
cases the TimeML annotation guidelines (Pustejovsky et
al., 2003) developed ﬁrst for English. They have then
been adapted to other languages such as Italian (Caselli
and Sprugnoli, 2015), Spanish (Saur´ı et al., 2009) and
French (Bittar, 2010). However until now no adaptation
of the guidelines to German has been done. The two cor-
pora of narratives in German, AncientTimes (Str¨otgen et
al., 2014) and WikiWarsDE (Str¨otgen and Gertz, 2011),
have been manually annotated but following the English
TimeML guidelines without further specifying language-

speciﬁc adaptations. WikiWarsDE is the German coun-
terpart of the English WikiWars corpus (Mazur and Dale,
2010) and AncientTimes is a small multilingual corpus con-
taining documents about history.
Driven by the above-mentioned shared tasks, many tempo-
ral taggers have been developed. Some of these can pro-
cess several languages, such as TIPSem (Llorens et al.,
2010) for English and Spanish, TimePro (Mirza and Mi-
nard, 2014) (a module of TextPro2) for English, Italian
and French, and HeidelTime (Str¨otgen and Gertz, 2013)
for 13 languages, including German, as well as its auto-
matic extension as a baseline temporal tagger for more
than 200 languages (Str¨otgen and Gertz, 2015). Str¨otgen
(2014) performed an evaluation of HeidelTime on
et al.
two German corpora of narratives: WikiWarsDE and An-
cientTimes. They reported F1-scores of 87.7 and 78.0 for
strict match, and value F1-scores3 of 80.4 and 82.2 on Wiki-
WarsDE and AncientTimes, respectively.
Our work consists of deﬁning TimeML guidelines for Ger-
man and annotating a corpus following these guidelines.
Using the newly annotated corpus, we report evaluation re-
sults for HeidelTime, which to the best of our knowledge is
the only temporal tagger available for German.

3. Corpus Description
KRAUTS (Korpus of newspapeR Articles with Underlined
Temporal expressionS) consists of two subsets: articles of
the daily, regional newspaper DOLOMITEN and articles of
the nationwide weekly newspaper DIE ZEIT. The corpus
is composed of 192 documents with a total of 75,678 to-
kens. Table 1 contains some statistics about both subsets.
Details about annotated temporal expressions will be given
in Section 5.

3.1. Dolomiten
The DOLOMITEN subset consists of 142 articles published
between 2009 and 2016. DOLOMITEN is a local newspa-
per from South Tyrol (Italy) written in the local variant of
German. Therefore, the articles contain words and phrases
which are not used in High German, including the temporal
expression heuer which translates to “this year”.
Two students, supervised by two expert annotators, per-
formed the manual annotation of temporal expressions. 100
DOLOMITEN articles were annotated starting from raw text,
while the remaining 42 were ﬁrst pre-annotated with the
HeidelTime tool and then checked and corrected manually
in order to speed-up the annotation process.

3.2. Die Zeit
In the context of a Bachelors thesis on a time-centric anal-
ysis of German news articles (Lange, 2017), 50 documents
of the German weekly newspaper DIE ZEIT were manu-
ally annotated by two annotators – but without ﬁrst adapt-
ing the English annotation guidelines to German in a con-
cise way. This resulted in several discussions about non-
uniform annotations, and it was concluded that proper an-

of the temporal expressions with relaxed match and the correct-
ness of the normalization value.

notation guidelines for German are required to achieve high
quality manual annotations. In the context of the collab-
oration between the Fondazione Bruno Kessler and the
Max Planck Institute for Informatics, the 50 articles have
been re-annotated following the newly developed annota-
tion guidelines for German (cf. Section 4).
Compared to the documents in the DOLOMITEN part of the
KRAUTS corpus, the DIE ZEIT articles are very long (an
average of 885 tokens vs. 221 per article, respectively). In
addition, as they are sometimes rather non-standard news
articles, annotating temporal expressions in these docu-
ments is probably more challenging, even for humans.

4. German-speciﬁc Guidelines
As German presents some language-speciﬁc phenomena
which have to be taken into account when performing any
annotation task, it is not possible to apply the English tem-
poral annotation guidelines to German in a straightforward
way. The adaptations to be done mainly affect the extent
of temporal expressions. In particular, in German there are
compounds which can sometimes contain temporal expres-
sions (e.g., Diskussionabende “Evenings of discussion”)
and there are contractions of prepositions and articles (e.g.,
im: in + dem “in the”). It is widely accepted that annota-
tions of temporal expressions should always start and end
at a token boundary, whereas the speciﬁc morphology of
German would lead to annotating a subpart of the tokens
in the case of compounds and contractions. This illustrates
that the English annotation guidelines cannot be directly
applied, as these state that articles, when present, are part
of temporal expressions while prepositions are not.
In order to develop the guidelines needed for the annota-
tion of temporal expressions in German, we selected the
It-TimeML guidelines (Caselli and Sprugnoli, 2015) as a
reference. The choice was motivated not only by the fact
that these guidelines are very well-deﬁned and detailed, but
also by the fact that in Italian, as in German, it is also pos-
sible to contract articles and prepositions. Thus, the Italian
guidelines are a more natural choice than the English ones
when adapting annotation guidelines to German.
The new guidelines we produced are summarized in the
document Examples and Guidelines for Annotation of Tem-
poral Expressions (<TIMEX3>) in German, which is an

download on the It-TimeML website4 and linked from the
KRAUTS website. The annex contains the extensions
needed to adapt the It-TimeML guidelines to the speciﬁc
morpho-syntactic features of German, as well as many Ger-
man annotated examples to illustrate the application to the
German language of the relevant It-TimeML guidelines.

The numbering of the examples in the annex is the same
as in the It-TimeML guidelines.

4.1. Compounds
Compound words, lexemes that consists of more than one
lexical element, are very frequent in German. For exam-
ple, Werktag is composed of Werk “work” and Tag “day”
and means “working day”. We can see in this example
that compounds can contain lexical elements with tempo-
ral meaning.
According to our guidelines, a compound containing a tem-
poral trigger has to be annotated if the syntactic head of the
compound is a temporal trigger. If the syntactic head is not
a temporal trigger, on the other hand, the compound should
not be annotated, even if it contains a temporal trigger. For
example, Diskussionsabende in (1) is annotated because
the syntactic head abend “evening” is a temporal trigger,
whereas Monatsblatt in (2) is not annotated (the syntactic
head is blatt “leaﬂet”, which is not a temporal trigger).

Diskussionsabende</TIMEX3> veranstaltet.
[Furthermore, two evenings of discussion will be or-
ganized in the youth center.]

(2) Jedes Monatsblatt behandelt ein eigenes Thema.

[Each monthly leaﬂet addresses a speciﬁc subject.]

4.2. Prepositions, Articles, and Contractions
Following the general TimeML rule, articles (whatever
their case) are included in the extent of the temporal expres-
sions (3), while prepositions are excluded (4); as for con-
tractions of prepositions and deﬁnite articles, we adopted
the Italian guidelines and so they are not included in the ex-
tent of the temporal expression (5). This decision leaves
open the possibility of marking contractions in a future
step, as they often include prepositions used as indicators
of temporal relations. According to the TimeML frame-
work, these are to be marked as SIGNAL if the full task
of temporal annotation and not just temporal tagging is the
goal.

In the KRAUTS corpus, we have annotated the follow-
ing types of temporal expressions: DATE (calendar unit),
TIME (time of the day), DURATION (period of time), and
SET (reoccurring temporal expression), and the following
attributes:
tid (identiﬁer), type (type of the temporal ex-
pression), value (normalized value), anchorTimeID (ID of
the temporal expression to which the marked expression is
linked), beginPoint (begin point of a DURATION), end-
Point (end point of a DURATION), freq (frequency of a

SET), quant (quantiﬁer of a SET) and mod (temporal mod-
iﬁer).
According to the TimeML annotation guidelines, TIMEX3
tags with no extent (i.e., empty TIMEX3 tags) are intro-
duced, for example, to deal with unspeciﬁed time points,
which are sometimes needed to anchor durations. Never-
theless, in most prior work, empty TIMEX3 tags have not
been used, neither in annotated corpora nor by TIMEX3-
compliant temporal taggers.
However, in order to represent durations in a better way,
empty TIMEX3 tags should be annotated. We thus fol-
lowed the organizers of the Italian temporal tagging chal-
lenge EVENTI (Caselli et al., 2014) and the developers of
the MEANTIME corpus (Minard et al., 2016), who were
the ﬁrst, and, to the best of our knowledge, the only re-
searchers so far who have annotated empty TIMEX3 tags
in documents which have resulted in publicly available cor-
pora (the EVENTI corpus for Italian and the MEANTIME
corpus contains English, Dutch, Italian, and Spanish tem-
porally annotated news articles). An example of an empty
TIMEX3 tag is given in (6): The duration vor einem Monat
“one month ago” (vor is outside of the TIMEX3 tag as it is a
preposition) is annotated in the text and an empty TIMEX3
tag of type DATE is added which represent the date of one
month ago to anchor the duration.

endPoint=“t0”>einem Monat</TIMEX3> ...
<TIMEX3 tid=“t2” type=“DATE” value=“2017-12-
17” anchorTimeID=“t0”/>
[... one month ago ...]

In Table 2, we provide information about the distribution
of the different types of temporal expressions in the corpus.
In total, KRAUTS contains 1,140 (text-consuming) tem-
poral expressions and 71 empty TIMEX3 tags. 64% of the
temporal expressions are of type DATE.
The DOLOMITEN subset contains 587 temporal expres-
sions, a large proportion of which are dates. We observe a
rather high number of temporal expressions of type TIME
with regards to the type of texts (newspaper articles). We
can explain it by the presence of local event announcements
in the DOLOMITEN newspaper.
The DIE ZEIT subset contains 553 temporal expressions,
with a majority of dates. Compared to the DOLOMITEN
subset, it contains few time expressions and many duration
and set expressions. The rather low number of time expres-
sions is probably due to the fact that DIE ZEIT is a weekly

538

newspaper so that such ﬁne-granular expressions are less
important. Duration and set expressions often occur in ar-
ticles belonging to categories (such as “travel”) that are not
typical news categories. This also shows that the DIE ZEIT
subset contains very diverse articles and several some of the
documents can be considered as rather less typical news ar-
ticles compared to articles of a daily newspaper – which
increases the difﬁculty of temporal tagging the DIE ZEIT
subset of the KRAUTS corpus.

6. Evaluating HeidelTime on KRAUTS
In Table 3, we present the evaluation of HeidelTime, per-
formed with the TempEval-3 scorer5, on KRAUTS.6 We
have performed the evaluation on three sections of the
corpus separately: DOLOMITEN-42 (the subpart of the
Dolomiten articles pre-annotated with HeidelTime and re-
vised manually), DOLOMITEN-100 (the Dolomiten articles
annotated manually starting from raw texts), and DIE ZEIT.
For comparison, the best system for relaxed matching at
TempEval-3 on English news documents, SUTime, ob-
tained an F1-score of 90.32 on relaxed match, 79.57 on
strict match and 67.38 on value, and the overall best sys-
tem, HeidelTime, obtained an F1-score of 90.30 on relaxed
match, 81.34 on strict match, and 77.61 on value.
The results obtained on DOLOMITEN-42 are higher than
this can be
those obtained on the other two sections;
explained considering that the DOLOMITEN-42 articles
had been pre-annotated with HeidelTime and consequently
the ﬁnal annotation (after manual revision) might still be
slightly biased.
The results on the DIE ZEIT articles are the lowest, proba-
bly because the articles are very long and thus have a more
complex temporal discourse structure. In addition, some ar-
ticles are written in a narrative rather than news-style fash-
ion – due to the characteristics of the weekly newspaper in
general – which led to incorrect normalizations.
In Table 4, we give the detailed results obtained for each
type of temporal expression. We can observe that the best
results are obtained for temporal expressions of type DATE
and DURATION. The results for type SET are low, but
it should be noticed that the corpus contains very few of
them so that few false positives and false negatives lower
the score signiﬁcantly.
We have analyzed the annotations made by HeidelTime
on the corpus DOLOMITEN-42 (corpus of 42 ﬁles pre-
annotated with HeidelTime). We counted three false pos-
itives: the age of a person (which is not to be marked as
a temporal expression), a four digit number that was not a
year, and an occurrence of “Christmas” which did not refer
to Christmas as a time period but, more in general, as a sub-
ject. As false negatives we found many expressions where

6“Strict” and “relaxed” refer to the evaluation of the extent of
the temporal expressions; “type” and “value” represent the evalu-
ation of the respective attributes. The F1-score is computed taking
into account the recognition of the temporal expressions with re-
laxed match and the identiﬁcation of the attribute. The TempEval-
3 scorer does not evaluate the empty TIMEX3 tags, so they are
not part of the presented evaluation.

an hour on the dot, as well as expressions with the ordinal
number of the week (e.g., “der dritten Woche” [the third
week]). Introducing a few new rules will prevent the tool
from leaving out these temporal expressions in the future.

7. Conclusions
In this paper, we deﬁned speciﬁc TimeML guidelines for
German starting from It-TimeML, the Italian TimeML
guidelines. Following these new guidelines we annotated
a corpus of newspaper articles: the KRAUTS corpus. It
is the ﬁrst news corpus for temporal tagging in German.
It consists of 192 articles from a daily, regional newspaper
and a weekly newspaper, with 1,140 annotated temporal ex-
pressions.
As a benchmark for the evaluation of automatic systems,
we have exploited KRAUTS to evaluate HeidelTime, the
temporal tagger for German, which has only been evalu-
ated against narrative-style corpora for German so far. On
two of the three subparts of the corpus (DOLOMITEN-100
and DIE ZEIT) it obtained F1-scores of around 70 and 80,
respectively for strict and relaxed match.
KRAUTS contains different kinds of news articles which
differ from the length of the documents and the proportion
of each type of TIMEX3. This is not enough in order to
develop and evaluate a generic temporal tagger. For Ger-
man, narrative-style temporal annotated documents are also
available. It will now be interesting to also annotate some
colloquial texts, such as tweets or emails.
