Abstract—Recently, it was shown that excellent results can be
achieved in both face landmark localization and pose-invariant
face recognition. These breakthroughs are attributed to the efforts
of the community to manually annotate facial images in many
different poses and to collect 3D faces data. In this paper, we
propose a novel method for joint face landmark localization
and frontal face reconstruction (pose correction) using a small
set of frontal images only. By observing that the frontal facial
image is the one with the minimum rank from all different
poses we formulate an appropriate model which is able to
jointly recover the facial landmarks as well as the frontalized
version of the face. To this end, a suitable optimization problem,
involving the minimization of the nuclear norm and the matrix (cid:96)1
norm, is solved. The proposed method is assessed in frontal face
reconstruction (pose correction), face landmark localization, and
pose-invariant face recognition and veriﬁcation by conducting
experiments on 6 facial
images databases. The experimental
results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

I.

INTRODUCTION

Face analysis is one of the most popular computer vision
problems. Important topics in face analysis include generic
face alignment [5], [39] and automatic face recognition [4],
[40]. These problems have been considered as separate, both
creating a wealth of scientiﬁc research in Computer Vision. In
particular state-of-the-art face alignment and landmark local-
ization methods [5], [39] model the problem discriminatively
by capitalizing on the availability of annotated, with regards to
facial landmarks, data [30], [31]. Unfortunately, the annotation
of facial landmark is laborious, expensive, and time consuming
process. This is more evident in cases where the face is not
in frontal pose and some facial features and the boundary are
neither visible nor well-deﬁned.1

Existing methods for face alignment can be roughly divided
into two main categories: (a) Holistic methods which use the
whole texture of face as representation, and (b) part-based
methods which represent the face by using a set of local
image patches extracted around of the predeﬁned landmark
points. The most-well known methods from the ﬁrst category
are the Active Appearance Models (AAMs) [12], [25], [35]
and the 3D Deformable Models (3DMs) [8]. In the second
category, methods such as the Active Shape Models (ASMs)
[13] and the Constrained Local Models (CLMs) [14], [32]
are included. Many of the above mentioned face alignment
methods have achieved state-of-the-art results (e.g., [5], [39])
in facial landmark localization under in-the-wild conditions

but they are trained on many annotated samples from various
poses.

On the other hand, in the majority of face recognition
systems the ﬁrst and arguably, most important, step of face
alignment is taken for granted using off the self methods
[38], [39]. Even in the recent state-of-the-art face recognition
methods, where millions of image are used to train feature
extractors and classiﬁers, the pivotal step that increases their
performance is that of face alignment [34], [40]. In such
cases, the alignment step is very elaborate requiring to both
locate landmarks and use 3D face models for pose corrections.
In general, 3D model-based methods have high recognition
accuracy due to the incorporation of the 3D model. However,
such methods cannot by widely applied since they require: (a)
a method for accurate landmark localization in various poses,
(b) to ﬁt learned 3D model of faces, which is expensive to
built, and (c) to develop robust image warping algorithms to
reconstruct the frontal image [34]. A recent approach that does
not require a 3D model but only a small set of landmarks is
presented in [18]. This method aims to reconstruct the virtual
view of an non-frontal image by employing Markov Random
Field. The main drawback of the aforementioned method is
that for each non-frontal image an exhaustively batch-based
alignment algorithm trained on frontal patches is applied.
Clearly, such a procedure is time consuming.

1From experience we know that annotation of facial image with poses take

in many cases twice the time compared with frontal poses.

In this paper, motivated by the observation that the rank
of a frontal facial image, due to the approximately structure

images is employed. In that sense, our method can be seen
as a deformable TILT model regularized within a frontal face
subspace.

Summarizing, the contributions of the paper are:
•

Technical contribution: We develop a joint landmark
localization and face frontalization method by propos-
ing a deformable and appropriately regularized TILT.

•

Applications in computer vision:

1)

2)

To the best of our knowledge this is the ﬁrst
generic landmark localization method which
achieves state-of-the-art results using a model
of frontal images only.
It is possible to improve or match the state-
of-the-art in unconstrained face recognition
using only frontal faces and simple features
for classiﬁcation unlike other complex feature
extraction procedures e.g., [33].2

II. NOTATION AND PRELIMINARIES

Throughout the paper, scalars are denoted by lower-case
letters, vectors (matrices) are denoted by lower-case (upper-
case) boldface letters i.e., x, (X). I denotes the identity matrix
of compatible dimensions. The ith column of X is denoted by
xi. A vector x ∈ Rm·n (matrix X ∈ Rm×n) is reshaped into
a matrix (vector) via the reshape operator : Rm×n(x) = X ∈
Rm×n, (cid:0)vec(X) = x ∈ Rm·n(cid:1).

The (cid:96)1 and the (cid:96)2 norms of x are deﬁned as (cid:107)x(cid:107)1 = (cid:80)

i |xi|
and (cid:107)x(cid:107)2 = (cid:112)(cid:80)
i x2
i , respectively. The matrix (cid:96)1 norm is
deﬁned as (cid:107)X(cid:107)1 = (cid:80)
(cid:80)
j |xij|, where |·| denotes the absolute
i
value operator. The Frobenius norm is deﬁned as (cid:107)X(cid:107)F =
(cid:113)(cid:80)
ij, and the nuclear norm of X (i.e., the sum of
singular values of a matrix) is denoted by (cid:107)X(cid:107)∗. XT is the
transpose of X. If X is a square matrix, X−1 is its inverse,
provided that the inverse matrix exists.

j x2

(cid:80)

The warp function x(W(p)) (cid:0)X(W(p))(cid:1) denotes the
warping of 2D coordinates arranged as vector (matrix) by a
warp parameter vector p ∈ Rv, where v is the number of the
warping parameters, back to reference coordinate system. To
simplify the notation x(p) (cid:0)X(p)(cid:1) will be used throughout
the paper instead of x(W(p)) (cid:0)X(W(p))(cid:1).

III. PROPOSED METHOD

A. Problem formulation

In this paper, the goal is to recover the frontal view (i.e.,
L ∈ Rm×n) of a warped facial image (i.e., X(p) ∈ Rm×n)
which is possibly corrupted by sparse error of large magnitude.
Such sparse errors indicate that only a small fraction of the
image pixels may be corrupted by non-Gaussian noise and
occlusions. In particular, based on the observation that the
frontal view of a face lies onto a low-rank subspace (please
refer to Fig. 2), it can be expressed as a linear combination
of a small number of orthonormal learned basis (i.e. U =
[u1, u2, . . . , uk] ∈ Rf ×k, UT U = I) that span a generic

2We note that we refer to the restricted protocol of the LFW [20] and not
to the unrestricted which unfortunately we cannot compete since we do not
have access to millions of annotated faces.

of human face, is much smaller than the rank of facial images
in other poses, we propose a uniﬁed framework for joint
face frontalization (pose correction), landmark localization and
(single sample) pose invariant face recognition. We show this
can be achieved by using a model built from frontal images
only. To validate the above observation ‘Neutral’ images of
twenty objects from MultiPIE database under poses −300 : 300
were warped into a reference frame and the nuclear norm
(convex surrogate of the rank) of each shape-free texture was
computed. In Fig. 2 the average value of the nuclear norm for
the different poses is depicted. Clearly, the frontal pose has
the smallest nuclear norm value compared the corresponding
value of the rest of the poses. The ﬂowchart of the proposed
method (coined as FAR - Face frontalization for Alignment
and Recognition) is depicted in Fig 1.

The most closely related work to the proposed method
is the Transform Invariant Low-rank Textures (TILT) method
[43]. In TILT, texture rectiﬁcation is obtained by applying a
global afﬁne transformation onto a low-rank term, modelling
the texture. By blindly imposing low-rank constraints without
regularization, for non-rigid alignment opposite effects may
occur. We applied the TILT with a non-rigid facial shape model
and its performance was very poor as it can be observed in
Fig. 3. Recently, it was demonstrated [11], [29], that non-
rigid deformable models cannot be straightforward combined
with optimization problems [27] that involve low-rank terms
without a proper regularization. To overcome this and ensure

where the nuclear norm (cid:107)L(cid:107)∗ and the (cid:96)1 norm (cid:107)E(cid:107)1 are
utilized to promote low-rank on L and sparsity in E, while λ is
a positive parameter balancing the norms. The nuclear and (cid:96)1
norms are the closest convex surrogates to the natural criteria
of rank [16] and cardinality [15] which are NP-hard in general
to optimize [26], [37]. However, (2) is difﬁcult to be solved
due to the non-linearity of the constraint X(p) = L + E. To
remedy this, a ﬁrst order Taylor linear approximation is applied
on the vectorized form of the constrained: x(p+∆p) ≈ x(p)+
J(p)∆p. where vec(X(p)) = vec(L + E) = Uc + e = x(p)
and J(p) = ∇x(p) ∂W
∂p is the Jacobian matrix with the steepest
descent images as its columns. Consequently, (2) is written as:

To solve (3), the augmented Lagrangian [7] is introduced:

the Alternating Directions Method (ADM) of multipliers [7],
(3) is solved by minimizing (4) with respect to each variable
in an alternating fashion and ﬁnally the Lagrange multipliers
are updated at each iteration as outlined in Algorithm 1 its
derivation is provided next.

Let t be the iteration index. Given the Lt, ct, ∆pt, et, at,
and Bt, the updates are computed by solving the following

than the threshold (cid:15)1 or the maximum number of the outers’
loop iterations is reached. The dominant cost of each iteration
of Algorithm 1 is that of the SVD algorithm involved in
the computation of the SVT operator in update of L. Con-
sequently, the computational complexity of Algorithm 1 is
O(T (min(m, n)3 + n2k)), where T is the total number of
iterations until convergence.

IV. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS

The performance of the FAR is assessed in: a) frontal face
reconstruction, b) landmark localization, and c) pose invariant
face recognition and veriﬁcation, by conducting experiments
in 6 facial image databases, which are described brieﬂy next.

A. Data description

LFPW: The Labeled Faces Parts in-the-wild (LFPW) [6]
database contains images downloaded from the internet (i.e.,
gooogle.com, ﬂickr.com etc), images exhibiting multiple vari-
ations such as pose, expression, illumination, and occlusions.
Since only the URLs of images were provided, 811 out of the
1, 132 training images and 224 out of the 300 test images were
downloaded.

HELEN: The HELEN [22] database consists of 2, 300
images downloaded from Flickr web service, containing a
broad range of appearance variation, including pose, lighting,
expression, occlusion, and individual differences. The size of
the face in each of the images was approximately 500 × 500
pixels.

AFW: The Annotated Faces in-the-wild (AFW)
[44]
database consists of 250 images with 468 faces. That is more
than one faces are annotated in each image. The images
exhibit similar variations with those in the LFPW and HELEN
databases.

FERET: The Facial Recognition Technology (FERET)
[28] database consists of 14, 051 images of 200 different
subjects. All images capture the same ‘Neutral’ expression
for 9 different poses under different illuminations, where each
subject also has an additional image with a random facial
expression.

MultiPIE: The CMU Multi Pose Illumination and Ex-
pression (MultiPIE) [17] database consists of approximately
750, 000 images from 337 subjects, captured under 6 different
expressions, 15 poses, and 19 illuminations.

LFW: The Labeled Faces in the Wild (LFW) [20] database
contains 13,233 images of 5,749 people downloaded from

the Web and is designed as a benchmark for the problem
of unconstrained automatic face veriﬁcation. All images are
characterized by the existence of large pose, expression and
occlusion variations.

B. Experimental setup

In all experiments, the orthonormal clean face subspace
U was constructed by employing only frontal view without
occlusions face images. In total 500 frontal images (217 from
the training set of the LFPW and 283 from the training set
of the HELEN databases) were selected to build the bases U.
The frontal images were warped in a common frame (185 ×
193 pixels) by using a piece-wise afﬁne motion model and
subsequently the PCA was applied on the warped shape-free
textures. The ﬁrst k = 450 eigen-images were kept. Unless
otherwise stated, throughout the experiments, the same U was
used and the parameters of the Algorithm 1 were ﬁxed: λ =
0.3, ρ = 1.1, µ0 = 10−6, (cid:15)1 = 10−3, (cid:15)2 = 10−5, and (cid:15)3 =
10−7.

C. Frontal face reconstruction

Next, the ability of the FAR to reconstruct frontal faces
from non-frontal images of unseen subjects is investigated
by using two unseen subjects taken from MultiPIE and from
FERET databases and 5 in-the-wild images.

in-the-wild conditions.

Given an input facial image, the initialization was produced
by applying the detector [44]. The image, the initialization and
U were given as input into Algorithm 1. By using the produced
∆p the outer loop was rerun again for one iteration without
updating ∆p the execution of sub-problem (15).

In Fig. 5 (rows: 1-2) the reconstructed frontal faces from
the non-frontal images (‘ba’, ‘bc’, ‘bd’, ‘be’, ‘bf’, ‘bg’, and
‘bh’) of ‘00268’ subject from FERET database are illustrated.

the images taken from MultiPIE with (a) ‘Surprise’ at −30◦,

that the matrix (cid:96)1-norm was adopted for non-Gaussian noise

images are depicted in Fig. 5 (rows: 5-6).

To quantitatively assess the quality of the frontalized im-
ages the following experiment was conducted. To this end,
‘Neutral’ images of 20 different subjects of MultiPIE under
poses −300 : 300 (5 for each subject, 100 in total) were
selected. The images of each subject were frontalized by
employing the FAR. The Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)
between each frontalized image and the real frontal image of
the subject is used as evaluation metric. The performance of the
FAR with respect to RMSE is compared with that obtained by
the frontalization system of the DeepFace [34]. The average
RMSEs of the FAR and DeepFace are 0.0817 and 0.1025,
respectively. It is worth noting that, even DeepFace employs a
3D model to handle out-of-planar rotations, the FAR performs
better without using any kind of 3D information.

D. Face landmark localization

The performance of the FAR in the generic face alignment
problem is assessed by conducting experiments on in-the-wild
databases namely. the LFPW, the HELEN and the AFW. To
this end, the performance of the FAR is compared against that
obtained by (a) the AAMs, the CLMs, and the SDM using
exactly the same training data as well as the same features and
(b) the state-of-the-art method and features. The annotations
provided in [30], [31] have been employed for evaluation
purposes. The average point-to-point Euclidean distance of 49
interior landmark points (excluding the points correspond to
face boundary) normalized by the Euclidean distance of the
outer corner of eyes is used as the evaluation measure. In
addition, the cumulative error distribution curve (CED) for
each method is computed by using the fraction of test images
for which the average error was smaller than a threshold.

Same train set and features: In order to compare fairly
the competing methods, the same training data, initialization,
and features were employed. The 500 frontal images used to
build the U, were used as the training set while the pixel
intensities (PIs) were selected as the texture representation. The
results produced by the detector [44] were used to initialize the
methods. For this experiment the implementations provided by
the platform MENPO [1] were used for all methods.

The CEDs produced by all methods for the LFPW (test set),
the HELEN (test set), and the AFW databases are depicted
in Fig. 6. Clearly, the FAR outperforms the AAMs-PIs, the
CLMs-PIs, and the SDM-PIs. More speciﬁcally, for normalized
error equal to 0.053 the FAR yield an 20.1%, 21.5% and 24.6%
improvement compared to that obtained by the AAMs-PIs

3This value was found by visually inspecting the results.

of-the-art method SDM [39]. In particular, the implementation
as well as the pre-trained model provided by the authors were
used. Both the FAR and the SDM were initialized by using the
same detector [44], and the SDM was initialized following the
instructions of the authors4. The CEDs from this experiment
are shown in Fig.7 where the FAR achieves comparable
performance with that obtained by SDM using only 500
frontal images. It is worth mentioning, the SDM was trained
on thousand images captured under several variations including
different poses, illuminations and expression. Furthermore, the
SDM method takes full advantage of SIFT - a powerful hand-
crafted feature - while the FAR employs only pixel intensities.

E. Pose-invariant face recognition and veriﬁcation

The performance of the FAR on pose invariant face recog-
nition and veriﬁcation is assessed by conducting experiments
on the MultiPIE, FERET, and LFW databases. Apart from the
experimental results reported in this section more can be found
on the supplementary materials.

1) Pose invariant face recognition: The frontal views of
images were reconstructed following the methodology
all
described in Section IV-C. The reconstructed images were
cropped to remove the surrounding black pixels. The Image
Gradient Orientations (IGOS) features [36] were used for
image representation. The dimensionality of IGOs was reduced
by applying PCA. The classiﬁer in [41] was used.

The performance of the FAR is compared against of that
obtained by the following 2D based methods LGBP [42] and
PIMRF [18], 3D based methods 3DPN [4], EGFC [24], and
PAF [40] as well as the Deep learning based methods SPAE
[21] and DIPFS [45]. It should be noticed that all methods
were evaluated under the fully automatic scenario; where both

from the test databases are depicted in Fig. 8.

State-of-the-art method and features:

In this experiment, the FAR is compared against the state-

were located automatically.

Results on FERET: One frontal image, denoted as ‘ba’,
from each of the 200 subjects was used to form the gallery
set, while the images captured at 6 different poses i.e., from
−40◦ to 40◦ were selected as the probe images.

FAR

In Table I the recognition rates achieved by the competing
methods in the different poses are reported. Clearly, the FAR
(recognition accuracy 98.58%) outperforms both the 2D and
3D state-of-the-art methods PIMRF and PAF, respectively. It is
worth mention that the PIMRF employs 200 images from the
FERET database (different from the test set) in order to train
the frontal synthesizer. Consequently, the different lighting
conditions of the database are taken into account. This is not
the case for the FAR where only frontal images from a generic
in-the-wild database (i.e., the LFPW and HELEN) have been
used. Even the FAR does not use any kind of 3D information it
outperforms the PAF where an elaborated 3D model (trained
from 4.624 facial scans) has been used to ﬁnd the 3D pose
and extract pose adaptive features. The reported results of the
EGFC [24] were not included in Table I as they were obtained
using a semi-automatic protocol (i.e., 5 manually annotated
landmark points used).

Results on MultiPIE: The images of the 137 subjects
(Subject ID 201: 346) with ‘Neutral expression and poses
−30◦ : +30◦ captured under 4 different sessions were selected.
The gallery was created by the frontal images of the earliest
session for each subject, while the rest images including frontal
and non-frontal views were used as probes. It should be
mentioned that images of ﬁrst 200 subjects which include
all poses (4207 in total) were used for training purposes. In
particular, the above mentioned images were used in the 3DPN
to train view-based models, in the SPAE, DIPFS to train the
deep networks, and in the EGFC to train the pose estimator
and matching model. The recognition accuracy achieved by
the just mentioned methods is reported in Table II. Again, the
FAR outperforms four out of ﬁve methods that is compared to,
verifying the high quality of the frontalized images. The FAR
also performs comparable with the DIPFS by simply using just
500 frontal images outside the MultiPIE.

2) Face veriﬁcation: The performance of the FAR in the
face veriﬁcation under in-the-wild conditions is assessed by
conducting experiment in the LFW database, using the ‘image-
restricted, no outside data results’ protocol. The reported
results are obtained using 10-fold cross validation.

In this experiment the basis U and the detector [44] were
not used since they based on images outside the database. To
create the initializations and a new ULF W , the method for
automatic construction of deformable models presented in [2]

was employed. The goal of this method is to build a deformable
model using only a set of images with the corresponding
bounding boxes. To deﬁne the bounding boxes without using
a pre-trained detector, the deep funneled images of the LFW
[19] were employed. Therefore, since these images are aligned
the exact bounding box is known. Subsequently, a deformable
model was built automatically from the training images of
each fold. The created model was ﬁtted to all images and
those (from training images) with ﬁtted shapes similar to mean
shape were selected to build the bases ULF W . In each fold
the images were frontalized using the ULF W and they were
cropped next. In the sequel, the gradient orientations φ1, φ2
of each image pair were extracted and the cosine of difference
between them ∆φ = φ1 − φ2 normalized to the range [0 − 2π],
was used as the feature of the pair. These features are classiﬁed
by a Support Vector Machine (SVM) with an RBF kernel. The
performance of the FAR is compared against that obtained
by the MRF-MLBP [3], Fisher Vector Faces [33] and the
EigenPEP [23] methods5. The mean classiﬁcation accuracy and
the corresponding standard deviation on LFW are reported in
Table III. By inspecting Table III the FAR outperforms the
MRF-MLBP and the Fisher Vector Faces and performance
comparably with the recently published method EigenPEP.

V. CONCLUSIONS

In this paper we developed the ﬁrst,

to the best our
knowledge, method that jointly performs landmark localization
and face frontalization using only a simple statistical model of
few hundred frontal images. The proposed method outperforms
state-of-the-art methods for face landmark localization that
were trained on thousands of images in many poses and
achieves comparable results in pose invariant face recognition
and veriﬁcation without using 3D elaborate models or Deep
Learning-based features extraction.
