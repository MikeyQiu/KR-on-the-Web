Abstract—Synthesizing face sketches from real photos and
its inverse have many applications. However, photo/sketch
synthesis remains a challenging problem due to the fact
that photo and sketch have different characteristics. In this
work, we consider this task as an image-to-image transla-
tion problem and explore the recently popular generative
models (GANs) to generate high-quality realistic photos
from sketches and sketches from photos. Recent GAN-
based methods have shown promising results on image-to-
image translation problems and photo-to-sketch synthesis
in particular, however, they are known to have limited
abilities in generating high-resolution realistic images. To
this end, we propose a novel synthesis framework called
Photo-Sketch Synthesis using Multi-Adversarial Networks,
(PS2-MAN) that iteratively generates low resolution to high
resolution images in an adversarial way. The hidden layers of
the generator are supervised to ﬁrst generate lower resolution
images followed by implicit reﬁnement in the network to
generate higher resolution images. Furthermore, since photo-
sketch synthesis is a coupled/paired translation problem, we
leverage the pair information using CycleGAN framework.
Both Image Quality Assessment (IQA) and Photo-Sketch
Matching experiments are conducted to demonstrate the
superior performance of our framework in comparison to
existing state-of-the-art solutions. Code available at:

I. INTRODUCTION

Research on biometrics has made signiﬁcant progress
in the past few decades and face remains the most com-
monly studied biometric primarily due to convenience of
data collection. In law enforcement and criminal cases,
automatic retrieval of photos of suspects from the police
mug shot database can enable the authorities to rapidly
narrow down potential suspects [35]. In practice, photos
of suspects are usually hard to acquire and it is known that
commercial softwares or experienced artists are sought to
generate sketches of a suspect based on the description
of eyewitness. Other than the applications in security,
face photo-sketch synthesis also has several applications
in digital entertainment. Photo sketches have also become
increasingly popular among the users of smart phones and
social networks where sketches are used as proﬁle photos
or avatars. Thus, photo-sketch synthesis and matching are
important and practical problems.

Earlier studies on face photo-sketch matching have
focused on directly matching photos to sketches and vice
versa [35]. However, due to differences in style and
appearance of photo and sketch, it is not practical to

directly perform matching between the two modalities.
A common approach to reduce this domain gap between
photo and sketch is to perform face photo-synthesis tech-
nique prior to matching. Several algorithms are proposed
on this topic in the literature. Existing approaches can
be generally classiﬁed into four categories based on the
types of sketches used[22]: (i) hand-drawn viewed sketch
[35],[48], (ii) hand-drawn semi-forensic sketch [19], (iii)
hand-drawn forensic sketch [14], [15], and (iv) software-
generated composite sketch [9].

Several works have successfully exploited Convolu-
tional Neural Networks (CNNs)
to perform different
image-to-image translation tasks. Recently, generative
models such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)
[8] and Variational Auto-Encoders (VAE) [13], [26] have
been more successful in such tasks due to their powerful
generative abilities. In particular, GANs [8] have achieved
impressive results in image generation, image editing and
representation learning [28], [40], [24], [4], [41]. Recent
studies also adopt
the original method for conditional
image generation tasks such as image-to-image translation
[11]. While Isola et al.([11]) considered paired data for
learning the image-to-image translation, Zhu et al.[49]
and Yi et al.[39] separately proposed unsupervised image-
to-image translation methods without the use of paired
data. Similar to [11], [39] and [49], in this work, face
photo-sketch synthesis is considered as an image-to-image
translation task. In fact, Yi et al.[39] presented some
preliminary results speciﬁcally for photo-sketch synthesis.
On evaluating these methods in detail for our task, it

was found that they had limitations in generating higher
resolution images (as shown in Fig.1). As argued in [42],
it is difﬁcult to train GANs to generate high-resolution
realistic images as they tend to generate images with
artifacts. This is attributed to the fact that as pixel space
dimension increases, the overlap between natural distribu-
tion of images and learned model distribution reduces. To
overcome this issue, a novel high-quality face photo-sketch
synthesis framework based on GANs is proposed. Since
in our task, both photo-to-sketch synthesis and sketch-to-
photo synthesis have practical applications, we adopt the
recently introduced CycleGAN [49] framework. Similar to
[49], the proposed method has two generators GA and GB
which generate sketch from photo and photo from sketch,
respectively. In contrast to [49], two major differences can
be noted: 1) To address the issue of artifacts in high-
resolution image generation, we propose the use of multi-
discriminator network. 2) While CycleGAN uses only
cycle-consistency loss, we additionally use L1 reconstruc-
tion error between generated output and target image. The
use of additional loss functions behaves as a regularization
during the learning process.

Existing GANs use generators that are constructed
similar to encoder-decoder style where the input image
is ﬁrst forwarded through a series of convolutions, non-
linearities and max-pooling resulting in lower resolution
feature maps which are then forwarded through a series
of deconvolutions and non-linearities. Noting that
the
deconvolutions iteratively learn the weights to upsample
the feature maps, this implicit presence of feature maps
at different resolutions is leveraged in this work by ap-
plying adversarial supervision at every level of resolution.
Speciﬁcally, the feature maps at every deconvolution layer
are convolved using 3 × 3 convolutions to produce outputs
at different resolutions (3 in particular). A discriminator
network is introduced at every resolution. By doing so,
supervision is provided directly to hidden layers of the
network which will enable iterative reﬁnement of the
feature maps and hence the output image. To summarize,
this paper makes the following contributions:

• A novel face photo-sketch synthesis framework based
on GANs involving multi-adversarial networks where
adversarial supervision is provided to hidden layers
of the network.

• While [39] and [27] present generic adversarial meth-
ods to perform image-to-image translation and show
some preliminary results on face photo-sketch syn-
thesis, to the best of our knowledge, ours is the ﬁrst
work to study in detail the use of adversarial networks
speciﬁcally for face photo-sketch synthesis.

• Detailed experiments are conducted to demonstrate
improvements in the synthesis results. Further, abla-
tion studies are conducted to verify the effectiveness
of iterative synthesis.

II. RELATED WORK

In this section, previous work on face photo-sketch
synthesis and generative modeling techniques that are

applied for image-to-image translation tasks are reviewed.

A. Face photo-sketch synthesis

Existing works can be categorized based on multiple
factors. Wang et al.[34] categorize photo-sketch synthesis
methods based on model construction techniques into
three main classes: 1) subspace learning-based, 2) sparse
representation-based, and 3) Bayesian inference-based ap-
proaches. Peng et al.[20] perform the categorization based
on representation strategies and come up with three broad
approaches: 1) holistic image-based, 2) independent local
patch-based, and 3) local patch with spatial constraints-
based methods.

Subspace learning based methods involve the use of
linear and non-linear subspace methods such as Principal
Component Analysis (PCA) and Local Linear Embedding
(LLE). Tang and Wang [30], [29] assume linear mapping
between photo and sketch and synthesized the sketch by
taking a linear combination of the Eigen vectors of sketch
images. Finding that the assumption of linear mapping
to be unreasonable, Liu et al.[16] proposed a non-linear
method based on LLE where they perform a patch-based
sketch synthesis. The input photo image is divided into
overlapping patches and transformed to corresponding
sketch patches using the LLE method. The whole sketch
image is then obtained by averaging the overlapping areas
between neighboring sketch patches. However, it leads to
blurring effect and ignores the neighboring relationships
among the patches and thus is unable to take advantage
of global structure. This work was extended by Wang et
al.[32], Gao et al.[6] and Change et al.[1] using sparse
representation-based techniques. In a different approach,
several methods were developed using Bayesian inference
techniques. Gao et al.[7] and Xiao et al.[38] employed
Hidden Markov Model (HMMs) to model non-linear rela-
tionship between sketches and photos. Wang and Tang [35]
proposed Markov Random Field (MRF) based technique
to incorporate relationship among neighboring patches.
Zhou et al.[48] improved over [35] by proposing Markov
weight ﬁelds (MWF) model that is capable of synthesizing
new target patches not existing in the training set. Wang
et al. [33] proposed a novel face sketch synthesis method
based on transductive learning.

More recently, Peng et al.[21] proposed a multiple
representations-based face sketch photo-synthesis method
that adaptively combines multiple representations to repre-
sent an image patch by combining multiple features from
face images processed using multiple ﬁlters. Additionally,
they employ Markov networks to model the relationship
between neighboring patches. Zhang et al.[45] employed
a sparse representation-based greedy search strategy to
ﬁrst estimate an initial sketch. Candidate image patches
from the initial estimated sketch and the template sketch
are then selected using multi-scale features. These can-
didate patches are reﬁned and assembled to obtain the
ﬁnal sketch which is further enhanced using a cascaded
regression strategy. Peng et al.[20] proposed a superpixel-
based synthesis method involving two stage synthesis

procedure. Wang et al.[31] recently proposed the use
of Bayesian framework consisting of neighbor selection
model and weight computation model. They consider spa-
tial neighboring constraint between adjacent image patches
for both models in contrast to existing methods where
the adjacency constraint is considered for only one of
the models. CNN-based method such as [5] and [2] were
proposed recently showing promising results. There is also
a recent work on face synthesis from facial attribute [3]
applying sketch to photo synthesis as a second stage in
their approach.

B. Image-to-image translation

In contrast to the traditional methods for photo-sketch
synthesis, several researchers have exploited the success
of CNNs for synthesis and cross-domain photo-sketch
recognition. Face photo-sketch synthesis is considered as
an image-to-image translation problem. Zhang et al.[43]
proposed an end-to-end fully convolutional network-based
photo-sketch synthesis method. Several methods have been
developed for related tasks such as general sketch synthe-
sis [27], photo-caricature translation [47] and creation of
parameterized avatars [37].

In this work, we explore generative modeling techniques
which have been highly successful for several
image-
to-image translation tasks. GANs [8], [49] and VAEs
[26], [13] are two recently popular classes of generative
techniques. GANs [8] are used to synthesize realistic
images by learning the distribution of training images.
GANs, motivated by game theory, consist of two compet-
ing networks: generator G and discriminator D. The goal
of GAN is to train G to produce samples from training
distribution such that the synthesized samples are indistin-
guishable from actual distribution by discriminator D. In
another variant called Conditional GAN , the generator is
conditioned on additional variables such as discrete labels,
text and images [11]. Recently, several variants based on
original GAN have been proposed for image-to-image
translation tasks. Isola et al.[11] proposed Conditional
GANs for several tasks such as labels to street scenes,
labels to facades, image colorization, etc. In an another
variant, Zhu et al.[49] proposed CycleGAN that learns
image-to-image translation in an unsupervised fashion.
Similar to the above approach, Yi et al.[39] proposed an
unsupervised method to perform translation tasks based
on unpaired data.

III. PROPOSED METHOD

In this section, the problem formulation is presented
followed by a detailed description of the proposed method
PS2-MAN. Also, details of generator’s and discriminator’s
network architecture are provided.

A. Formulation

Given a dataset (D) consisting of a set of face photo-
sketch pairs represented by {(Ai, Bi)}N
the goal of
photo-sketch synthesis is to learn two functions: (1)
B(cid:48)= f ps(A) that represents photo (A) to sketch (B) synthesis
and (2) A(cid:48)= fsp(B) that represents sketch (B) to photo

i=1,

(A) synthesis. In this work, we consider this problem as
an image-to-image translation task. Since both forward
(photo to sketch) and inverse (sketch to photo) transforma-
tions are of equal practical importance, this problem can be
easily accommodated into the CycleGAN [49] framework.
Similar to [49],
the proposed method consists of two
generator sub-networks GA and GB which transform from
photo to sketch and from sketch to photo, respectively. GA
takes in a real face photo image RA as input and produces
synthesized (fake) sketch FB as output. The aim of GB is
to transform sketch to photo, hence, it should transform
FB back to input photo itself, which we represent as RecA
here. Thus, the general process can be expressed as:

(1)

(2)

FB = GA(RA), RecA = GB(FB).

Similarly, sketch to photo generation can be expressed as:

FA = GB(RB), RecB = GA(FA),

where RB, FA and RecB are real sketch, synthesized
(fake) photo, and reconstructed sketch from fake photo,
respectively. Note that in the following context, the term
“fake” is same as “synthesized”.

B. Objective

As in GAN framework [8], the generators (GA and
GB) are trained using adversarial losses that come from
discriminator sub-networks. The goal of the generator
sub-networks is to produce images that are as realistic
as possible so as to fool the discriminator sub-networks,
where as the goal of the discriminator sub-networks is to
learn to classify between generated and real samples. The
use of adversarial loss is known to overcome the issue of
blurred outputs that is often encountered when only L1
or L2 loss is minimized [11]. In theory, GANs can learn
a mapping that produce outputs identically distributed as
target domain and although generic image-to-image trans-
lation GANs have been successful in generating visually
appealing results, they tend to produce artifacts in the
output (as shown in Fig 1) which adversely affects the
face/sketch matching performance. Hence, it is crucial to
generate outputs that are free from artifacts.

As discussed in [42], these artifacts arise due to known
training instabilities while generating high-resolution im-
ages. These instabilities are potentially caused due to
the fact that the supports of natural image distribution
and implied model distribution may not overlap in high-
dimensional space. The severity of this problem increases
with an increase in the image resolution. Thus, to avoid
these artifacts while generating realistic images, we pro-
pose a stage-by-stage multi-scale reﬁnement framework
by leveraging the implicit presence of features maps of
different resolutions in the generator sub-network. Consid-
ering that most GAN frameworks have generators similar
to encoder-decoder style with a stack of convolutional and
max-pooling layers followed by a series of deconvolution
layers. The deconvolution layers sequentially upsample
the feature maps from lower resolution to higher resolu-
tion. Feature maps from every deconvolutional layers are

Figure 2: Network structure of the proposed PS2-MAN framework. Adversarial supervision is provided through multiple
discriminators at the hidden layers. Note that, in addition to adversarial loss, cycle-consistency and L1-loss are also used
to train the network. However, for the purpose of illustration, we show only adversarial loss in this ﬁgure.

forwarded through 3 × 3 convolutional layer to generate
output images at different resolutions. As shown in Fig 2,
output images are generated at three resolution levels:
64 × 64, 128 × 128 and 256 × 256 for both generators
GA and GB. Further,
three separate discriminator sub-
networks are employed to provide adversarial feedback
to the generators. By doing so, we are providing supervi-
sion directly to hidden layers of the network which will
enable implicit iterative reﬁnement of the feature maps
resulting in high-quality synthesis. For simplicity, images
at different resolutions are represented as: RAi, FAi, RecAi,
RBi, FBi, and RecBi, where i = 1, 2 and three corresponds
to resolution of 64 × 64, 128 × 128 and ﬁnal output size,
which is 256 × 256.

Thus, as shown in Fig. 2, for a photo image RA, GA
generates {FB1, FB2, FB3} as outputs. Then FB3, which is the
output at the last deconvolution layer, is sent as input to GB
resulting in three reconstructions {RecA1,RecA2,RecA3}.
Similarly, for a sketch input, GB will output {FA1,FA2,FA3}.
And GA will produce {RecB1,RecB2,RecB3} by taking FA3
as input. We then add supervision at these different outputs
to force outputs to be closer to targets at different resolu-
tion levels. Three discriminators are deﬁned for each gen-
erator: DA64, DA128, DA256 for GA and DB64, DB128, DB256
for GB, which are applied on deconvolution layers with
resolutions of 64 × 64, 128 × 128 and 256 × 256, respec-
tively. The objective function is expressed as:

LGANAi

=EBi∼pdata(Bi)[log DAi(Bi)]

+ EA∼pdata(A)[log(1 − DAi(GA(RA))i)],

and

LGANBi

=EAi∼pdata(Ai)[log DAi(Ai)]

+ EB∼pdata(B)[log(1 − DBi(GB(RB))i)],

where (GA(RA))i = FBi, (GB(RB))i = FAi and i = 1, 2, 3
corresponds to discriminators at different levels.

To generate images which are as close to target images
as possible, we also minimize synthesis error Lsyn which
is deﬁned as the L1 difference between synthesized image

(3)

(4)

and corresponding target
image. Similar to adversarial
loss, Lsyn is minimized for all three resolution levels and
is deﬁned as:
LsynAi
LsynBi

= (cid:107)FAi − RAi(cid:107)1= (cid:107)GB(RB)i − RAi(cid:107)1
= (cid:107)FBi − RBi(cid:107)1= (cid:107)GA(RA)i − RBi(cid:107)1.

(5)

In spite of using Lsyn and the adversarial

loss, as
discussed in [49], we may have many mappings due to
the large capacity of networks. Hence, similar to [49],
the network is additionally regularized using forward-
backward consistency thereby reducing the space of pos-
sible mapping functions. This is achieved by introducing
cycle consistency losses at different resolution stages,
which are deﬁned as:

= (cid:107)RecAi − RAi(cid:107)1= (cid:107)GB(GA(RA))i − RAi(cid:107)1
= (cid:107)RecBi − RBi(cid:107)1= (cid:107)GA(GB(RB))i − RBi(cid:107)1.

LcycAi
LcycBi
The ﬁnal objective function is deﬁned as:

∑
i=1
+ λBi LsynBi

L(GA, GB, DA, DB) =

+ LGANBi

+ λAi LsynAi

).

+ ηAi LcycAi

+ ηBi LcycBi
To summarize, the ﬁnal objective function is constructed
using L1 error between synthesized and target images,
adversarial loss and cycle-consistency loss. L1 error en-
ables the network to synthesize images that are closer to
the target, however, they often result in blurry images.
Adversarial loss overcomes this issue thereby resulting in
relatively sharper images. However, the use of adversarial
loss at
the ﬁnal stage results in artifacts, which we
overcome by providing supervision to the hidden layers.
Cycle-consistency loss provides additional regularization
while learning the network parameters.

C. Network Architecture

The generator sub-networks are constructed using
stride-2 convolutions, residual blocks [10] and fractionally
strided convolutional layers. The network conﬁguration is
speciﬁed as follows:

C7S1-64, C3-128, C3-256, RB256×9, TC64, TC32,
C7S1-3, where, C7S1 − k denotes 7 × 7 Convolution-
BatchNormReLU layer with k ﬁlters and stride 1, Ck
denotes a 3 × 3 Convolution-BatchNorm-ReLU layer with
k ﬁlters, and stride 2, RBk × m denotes m residual block
that contains two 3 × 3 convolutional layers with the same
number of ﬁlters on both layers, TC denotes a 3 × 3
Transposed-Convolution-BatchNorm-ReLU layer with k
ﬁlters and stride 1
2 .

The discriminator networks are constructed using 70 ×
70 PatchGANs [11] that classify whether 70 × 70 over-
lapping image patches are real or fake. The network con-
ﬁguration is speciﬁed as: C64-C128-C256-C512, where
Ck denotes a 4 × 4 Convolution-BatchNorm-LeakyReLU
layer with k ﬁlters and stride 2.

IV. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS

In this section, experimental settings and evaluation of
the proposed method are discussed in detail. We present
the qualitative and quantitative results of the proposed
method on two popular datasets: CUFS [35] and CUFSF
[35], [46]. In addition to performance comparison with
state-of-the-art methods, ablation studies are conducted to
verify the effectiveness of various components of the pro-
posed method. Both visual and quantitative comparisons
are presented in both cases.

A. Datasets

The proposed method is evaluated on existing viewed
sketches datasets. CUHK Face Sketch database (CUFS)
[35] is a viewed sketch database which includes 188
faces from the Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK)
student database, 123 faces from the AR database [17],
and 295 faces from the XM2VTS database [18]. For each
face, there is a sketch drawn by an artist based on a photo
taken in a frontal pose under normal lighting condition,
and with a neutral expression.

CUFSF [35], [46] database includes 1,194 persons from
the FERET database [25]. For each person, there is a
face photo with lighting variation and a sketch with shape
exaggeration drawn by an artist when viewing this photo
[46]. This dataset is particularly challenging since the
photos are taken under different illumination conditions
and sketches have shape exaggeration as compared to
photos, however, the dataset is closer to forensic sketch
scenario.

Both datasets contain facial landmark coordinates which
can be easily applied for alignments. There also exist sev-
eral recent datasets without landmark information, recent
face alignment algorithms such as [23] can be applied in
the preprocessing stage.

B. Training Details

During model training procedure, each input image is
resized to the size of 256 × 256. Data augmentation is
performed on the ﬂy by adding random noise to input
images. The network is trained from scratch, similar to
the network initialization setup in [49], the learning rate
is set to 0.0002 for the ﬁrst 100 epochs, and linearly

decaying down to 0 for next 100 epochs. λi are all set
to 1 and ηi are all set to 0.7 in (III-B). Weights were
initialized from a Gaussian distribution with mean 0 and
standard deviation 0.02. The network is trained using the
Adam solver [12]. For the CUHK dataset, 188 face-sketch
pairs are divided such that 60 pairs are used for training,
28 pairs for validation and 100 pairs for testing. We
augmented training set by horizontally ﬂipping images so
that training set has 120 images in total. For the CUFSF
dataset, 1194 image pairs are divided to 600 for training,
297 for validation and 297 for testing. All images are pre-
processed by simply aligning center of the eyes to the
ﬁxed position and cropping to the size of 200 × 250.

C. Ablation Study

To demonstrate the advantage of our multi-adversarial
network structure over the single adversarial approach, we
compare the results of the following network conﬁgura-
tions on the CUHK dataset:

• C − D256: Proposed method with single discriminator

at the ﬁnal resolution level (256 × 256).

• C − D256,128: Proposed method with two discrimi-
nators at last two resolution levels (256 × 256 and
128 × 128).

• C − D256,128,64: Proposed method with two discrimi-
nators at three resolution levels (256 ×256, 128×128
and 64 × 64).

Fig. 3 shows sample results from the above conﬁg-
urations on the CUHK dataset. It can be observed that
the performance in terms of visual quality improves as
more levels of supervision are added. Similar observations
can be made using the quantitative measurements such as
SSIM [36] and FSIM [44]) as shown in Table I.

D. Comparison with state-of-the-art methods

In addition to ablation studies, the proposed method is
compared with recent state-of-the-art photo-sketch synthe-

sis methods such as MWF [48], MrFSS [21], Pix2Pix [11],
CycleGAN [49] and DualGAN [39]. Sample sketch and
photo synthesis results on the CUHK dataset are shown
in Fig. 4 and Fig. 5, respectively. It can be observed that
MrFSS synthesis results in blurred outputs. The generative
models (Pix2Pix, CycleGAN and DualGAN) overcome the
blurred effect by using adversarial loss in addition to L1
loss. However, they tend to have undesirable artifacts due
to instabilities in training while generating high-resolution
the proposed method (PS2-MAN)
images. In contrast,
is able to preserve high-frequency details and minimize
the artifacts simultaneously. Also, photo synthesis using
CycleGAN results in color distortion. A potential reason
is the lack of L1 loss while training the network. Hence,
in our case, we use L1 reconstruction error between target
and synthesized image to train the network, thus providing
the network with further regularization.

Sample sketch and photo synthesis results on the

in Fig. 6 and Fig. 7, respectively. The CUFSF dataset
is particularly challenging since the sketches have over-
exaggerated features as compared to the ones present in
the real photos. It can be observed that in case of both
sketch and photo synthesis that the generative methods
(Pix2Pix, CycleGAN and DualGAN) introduce undesir-
able artifacts especially at facial features resulting. In
contrast, the proposed method is able to minimize the
artifacts while generating realistic images as compared to
the other methods.

Similar to ablation studies, we also compare the results
of all
the above methods using quantitative measures
(SSIM and FSIM) as shown in Table II. The proposed
method achieves the best results in terms of SSIM and
FSIM as compared to the other methods. Additionally, the
methods are also compared using photo-sketch face match-
ing rates using two approaches: (1) Synthesize sketches
from photos and used these synthesized sketches to match
with real sketch gallery.
(2) Synthesize photos from
sketches and use these synthesized photos to match with
real photos gallery. The matching rates were calculated
by computing the LBP features and cosine distance. The
matching rates using generative techniques on the CUHK
and CUFSF datasets for various are illustrated in Fig. 8
and 9 and respectively in terms of the Cumulative Match-
ing Characteristic (CMC) curves. Table III summarize the
rank-1 matching rates. It can be observed from Fig. 8 and
9 that the proposed method achieves best matching rates
at all ranks.

To summarize, through various experiments it is demon-
strated that the proposed method PS2-MAN is able to gen-
erate realistic results with minimal artifacts as compared
to existing methods. This is mainly due to the multi-
adversarial network used in our approach. Additionally,
the proposed method achieves signiﬁcant improvements
over the other techniques in terms of various quality
measures (such as SSIM and FSIM ) and matching rates
while generating visually appealing outputs.

V. CONCLUSION

We explored the problem of photo-sketch synthesis
using the recently introduced generative models. A novel
synthesis method using multi-adversarial networks is pre-
sented. The proposed method is developed speciﬁcally to
enable GANs to generate high resolution images. This is
achieved by providing adversarial supervision to hidden
layers of the generator sub-network. Additionally,
the
forward and backward synthesis are trained iteratively in
the CycleGAN framework, i.e., in addition to minimizing
L1 reconstruction error, cycle-consistency loss is also
used in the objective function. These additional loss func-
tions provide appropriate regularization thereby generating
high-quality and high resolution photo-sketch synthesis.
Evaluations are performed on two popular datasets and the
results are compared with recent state-of-the-art generative
the proposed
is clearly demonstrated that
methods. It
method achieves signiﬁcant
improvements in terms of
visual quality and photo/sketch matching rates.

Abstract—Synthesizing face sketches from real photos and
its inverse have many applications. However, photo/sketch
synthesis remains a challenging problem due to the fact
that photo and sketch have different characteristics. In this
work, we consider this task as an image-to-image transla-
tion problem and explore the recently popular generative
models (GANs) to generate high-quality realistic photos
from sketches and sketches from photos. Recent GAN-
based methods have shown promising results on image-to-
image translation problems and photo-to-sketch synthesis
in particular, however, they are known to have limited
abilities in generating high-resolution realistic images. To
this end, we propose a novel synthesis framework called
Photo-Sketch Synthesis using Multi-Adversarial Networks,
(PS2-MAN) that iteratively generates low resolution to high
resolution images in an adversarial way. The hidden layers of
the generator are supervised to ﬁrst generate lower resolution
images followed by implicit reﬁnement in the network to
generate higher resolution images. Furthermore, since photo-
sketch synthesis is a coupled/paired translation problem, we
leverage the pair information using CycleGAN framework.
Both Image Quality Assessment (IQA) and Photo-Sketch
Matching experiments are conducted to demonstrate the
superior performance of our framework in comparison to
existing state-of-the-art solutions. Code available at:

I. INTRODUCTION

Research on biometrics has made signiﬁcant progress
in the past few decades and face remains the most com-
monly studied biometric primarily due to convenience of
data collection. In law enforcement and criminal cases,
automatic retrieval of photos of suspects from the police
mug shot database can enable the authorities to rapidly
narrow down potential suspects [35]. In practice, photos
of suspects are usually hard to acquire and it is known that
commercial softwares or experienced artists are sought to
generate sketches of a suspect based on the description
of eyewitness. Other than the applications in security,
face photo-sketch synthesis also has several applications
in digital entertainment. Photo sketches have also become
increasingly popular among the users of smart phones and
social networks where sketches are used as proﬁle photos
or avatars. Thus, photo-sketch synthesis and matching are
important and practical problems.

Earlier studies on face photo-sketch matching have
focused on directly matching photos to sketches and vice
versa [35]. However, due to differences in style and
appearance of photo and sketch, it is not practical to

directly perform matching between the two modalities.
A common approach to reduce this domain gap between
photo and sketch is to perform face photo-synthesis tech-
nique prior to matching. Several algorithms are proposed
on this topic in the literature. Existing approaches can
be generally classiﬁed into four categories based on the
types of sketches used[22]: (i) hand-drawn viewed sketch
[35],[48], (ii) hand-drawn semi-forensic sketch [19], (iii)
hand-drawn forensic sketch [14], [15], and (iv) software-
generated composite sketch [9].

Several works have successfully exploited Convolu-
tional Neural Networks (CNNs)
to perform different
image-to-image translation tasks. Recently, generative
models such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)
[8] and Variational Auto-Encoders (VAE) [13], [26] have
been more successful in such tasks due to their powerful
generative abilities. In particular, GANs [8] have achieved
impressive results in image generation, image editing and
representation learning [28], [40], [24], [4], [41]. Recent
studies also adopt
the original method for conditional
image generation tasks such as image-to-image translation
[11]. While Isola et al.([11]) considered paired data for
learning the image-to-image translation, Zhu et al.[49]
and Yi et al.[39] separately proposed unsupervised image-
to-image translation methods without the use of paired
data. Similar to [11], [39] and [49], in this work, face
photo-sketch synthesis is considered as an image-to-image
translation task. In fact, Yi et al.[39] presented some
preliminary results speciﬁcally for photo-sketch synthesis.
On evaluating these methods in detail for our task, it

was found that they had limitations in generating higher
resolution images (as shown in Fig.1). As argued in [42],
it is difﬁcult to train GANs to generate high-resolution
realistic images as they tend to generate images with
artifacts. This is attributed to the fact that as pixel space
dimension increases, the overlap between natural distribu-
tion of images and learned model distribution reduces. To
overcome this issue, a novel high-quality face photo-sketch
synthesis framework based on GANs is proposed. Since
in our task, both photo-to-sketch synthesis and sketch-to-
photo synthesis have practical applications, we adopt the
recently introduced CycleGAN [49] framework. Similar to
[49], the proposed method has two generators GA and GB
which generate sketch from photo and photo from sketch,
respectively. In contrast to [49], two major differences can
be noted: 1) To address the issue of artifacts in high-
resolution image generation, we propose the use of multi-
discriminator network. 2) While CycleGAN uses only
cycle-consistency loss, we additionally use L1 reconstruc-
tion error between generated output and target image. The
use of additional loss functions behaves as a regularization
during the learning process.

Existing GANs use generators that are constructed
similar to encoder-decoder style where the input image
is ﬁrst forwarded through a series of convolutions, non-
linearities and max-pooling resulting in lower resolution
feature maps which are then forwarded through a series
of deconvolutions and non-linearities. Noting that
the
deconvolutions iteratively learn the weights to upsample
the feature maps, this implicit presence of feature maps
at different resolutions is leveraged in this work by ap-
plying adversarial supervision at every level of resolution.
Speciﬁcally, the feature maps at every deconvolution layer
are convolved using 3 × 3 convolutions to produce outputs
at different resolutions (3 in particular). A discriminator
network is introduced at every resolution. By doing so,
supervision is provided directly to hidden layers of the
network which will enable iterative reﬁnement of the
feature maps and hence the output image. To summarize,
this paper makes the following contributions:

• A novel face photo-sketch synthesis framework based
on GANs involving multi-adversarial networks where
adversarial supervision is provided to hidden layers
of the network.

• While [39] and [27] present generic adversarial meth-
ods to perform image-to-image translation and show
some preliminary results on face photo-sketch syn-
thesis, to the best of our knowledge, ours is the ﬁrst
work to study in detail the use of adversarial networks
speciﬁcally for face photo-sketch synthesis.

• Detailed experiments are conducted to demonstrate
improvements in the synthesis results. Further, abla-
tion studies are conducted to verify the effectiveness
of iterative synthesis.

II. RELATED WORK

In this section, previous work on face photo-sketch
synthesis and generative modeling techniques that are

applied for image-to-image translation tasks are reviewed.

A. Face photo-sketch synthesis

Existing works can be categorized based on multiple
factors. Wang et al.[34] categorize photo-sketch synthesis
methods based on model construction techniques into
three main classes: 1) subspace learning-based, 2) sparse
representation-based, and 3) Bayesian inference-based ap-
proaches. Peng et al.[20] perform the categorization based
on representation strategies and come up with three broad
approaches: 1) holistic image-based, 2) independent local
patch-based, and 3) local patch with spatial constraints-
based methods.

Subspace learning based methods involve the use of
linear and non-linear subspace methods such as Principal
Component Analysis (PCA) and Local Linear Embedding
(LLE). Tang and Wang [30], [29] assume linear mapping
between photo and sketch and synthesized the sketch by
taking a linear combination of the Eigen vectors of sketch
images. Finding that the assumption of linear mapping
to be unreasonable, Liu et al.[16] proposed a non-linear
method based on LLE where they perform a patch-based
sketch synthesis. The input photo image is divided into
overlapping patches and transformed to corresponding
sketch patches using the LLE method. The whole sketch
image is then obtained by averaging the overlapping areas
between neighboring sketch patches. However, it leads to
blurring effect and ignores the neighboring relationships
among the patches and thus is unable to take advantage
of global structure. This work was extended by Wang et
al.[32], Gao et al.[6] and Change et al.[1] using sparse
representation-based techniques. In a different approach,
several methods were developed using Bayesian inference
techniques. Gao et al.[7] and Xiao et al.[38] employed
Hidden Markov Model (HMMs) to model non-linear rela-
tionship between sketches and photos. Wang and Tang [35]
proposed Markov Random Field (MRF) based technique
to incorporate relationship among neighboring patches.
Zhou et al.[48] improved over [35] by proposing Markov
weight ﬁelds (MWF) model that is capable of synthesizing
new target patches not existing in the training set. Wang
et al. [33] proposed a novel face sketch synthesis method
based on transductive learning.

More recently, Peng et al.[21] proposed a multiple
representations-based face sketch photo-synthesis method
that adaptively combines multiple representations to repre-
sent an image patch by combining multiple features from
face images processed using multiple ﬁlters. Additionally,
they employ Markov networks to model the relationship
between neighboring patches. Zhang et al.[45] employed
a sparse representation-based greedy search strategy to
ﬁrst estimate an initial sketch. Candidate image patches
from the initial estimated sketch and the template sketch
are then selected using multi-scale features. These can-
didate patches are reﬁned and assembled to obtain the
ﬁnal sketch which is further enhanced using a cascaded
regression strategy. Peng et al.[20] proposed a superpixel-
based synthesis method involving two stage synthesis

procedure. Wang et al.[31] recently proposed the use
of Bayesian framework consisting of neighbor selection
model and weight computation model. They consider spa-
tial neighboring constraint between adjacent image patches
for both models in contrast to existing methods where
the adjacency constraint is considered for only one of
the models. CNN-based method such as [5] and [2] were
proposed recently showing promising results. There is also
a recent work on face synthesis from facial attribute [3]
applying sketch to photo synthesis as a second stage in
their approach.

B. Image-to-image translation

In contrast to the traditional methods for photo-sketch
synthesis, several researchers have exploited the success
of CNNs for synthesis and cross-domain photo-sketch
recognition. Face photo-sketch synthesis is considered as
an image-to-image translation problem. Zhang et al.[43]
proposed an end-to-end fully convolutional network-based
photo-sketch synthesis method. Several methods have been
developed for related tasks such as general sketch synthe-
sis [27], photo-caricature translation [47] and creation of
parameterized avatars [37].

In this work, we explore generative modeling techniques
which have been highly successful for several
image-
to-image translation tasks. GANs [8], [49] and VAEs
[26], [13] are two recently popular classes of generative
techniques. GANs [8] are used to synthesize realistic
images by learning the distribution of training images.
GANs, motivated by game theory, consist of two compet-
ing networks: generator G and discriminator D. The goal
of GAN is to train G to produce samples from training
distribution such that the synthesized samples are indistin-
guishable from actual distribution by discriminator D. In
another variant called Conditional GAN , the generator is
conditioned on additional variables such as discrete labels,
text and images [11]. Recently, several variants based on
original GAN have been proposed for image-to-image
translation tasks. Isola et al.[11] proposed Conditional
GANs for several tasks such as labels to street scenes,
labels to facades, image colorization, etc. In an another
variant, Zhu et al.[49] proposed CycleGAN that learns
image-to-image translation in an unsupervised fashion.
Similar to the above approach, Yi et al.[39] proposed an
unsupervised method to perform translation tasks based
on unpaired data.

III. PROPOSED METHOD

In this section, the problem formulation is presented
followed by a detailed description of the proposed method
PS2-MAN. Also, details of generator’s and discriminator’s
network architecture are provided.

A. Formulation

Given a dataset (D) consisting of a set of face photo-
sketch pairs represented by {(Ai, Bi)}N
the goal of
photo-sketch synthesis is to learn two functions: (1)
B(cid:48)= f ps(A) that represents photo (A) to sketch (B) synthesis
and (2) A(cid:48)= fsp(B) that represents sketch (B) to photo

i=1,

(A) synthesis. In this work, we consider this problem as
an image-to-image translation task. Since both forward
(photo to sketch) and inverse (sketch to photo) transforma-
tions are of equal practical importance, this problem can be
easily accommodated into the CycleGAN [49] framework.
Similar to [49],
the proposed method consists of two
generator sub-networks GA and GB which transform from
photo to sketch and from sketch to photo, respectively. GA
takes in a real face photo image RA as input and produces
synthesized (fake) sketch FB as output. The aim of GB is
to transform sketch to photo, hence, it should transform
FB back to input photo itself, which we represent as RecA
here. Thus, the general process can be expressed as:

(1)

(2)

FB = GA(RA), RecA = GB(FB).

Similarly, sketch to photo generation can be expressed as:

FA = GB(RB), RecB = GA(FA),

where RB, FA and RecB are real sketch, synthesized
(fake) photo, and reconstructed sketch from fake photo,
respectively. Note that in the following context, the term
“fake” is same as “synthesized”.

B. Objective

As in GAN framework [8], the generators (GA and
GB) are trained using adversarial losses that come from
discriminator sub-networks. The goal of the generator
sub-networks is to produce images that are as realistic
as possible so as to fool the discriminator sub-networks,
where as the goal of the discriminator sub-networks is to
learn to classify between generated and real samples. The
use of adversarial loss is known to overcome the issue of
blurred outputs that is often encountered when only L1
or L2 loss is minimized [11]. In theory, GANs can learn
a mapping that produce outputs identically distributed as
target domain and although generic image-to-image trans-
lation GANs have been successful in generating visually
appealing results, they tend to produce artifacts in the
output (as shown in Fig 1) which adversely affects the
face/sketch matching performance. Hence, it is crucial to
generate outputs that are free from artifacts.

As discussed in [42], these artifacts arise due to known
training instabilities while generating high-resolution im-
ages. These instabilities are potentially caused due to
the fact that the supports of natural image distribution
and implied model distribution may not overlap in high-
dimensional space. The severity of this problem increases
with an increase in the image resolution. Thus, to avoid
these artifacts while generating realistic images, we pro-
pose a stage-by-stage multi-scale reﬁnement framework
by leveraging the implicit presence of features maps of
different resolutions in the generator sub-network. Consid-
ering that most GAN frameworks have generators similar
to encoder-decoder style with a stack of convolutional and
max-pooling layers followed by a series of deconvolution
layers. The deconvolution layers sequentially upsample
the feature maps from lower resolution to higher resolu-
tion. Feature maps from every deconvolutional layers are

Figure 2: Network structure of the proposed PS2-MAN framework. Adversarial supervision is provided through multiple
discriminators at the hidden layers. Note that, in addition to adversarial loss, cycle-consistency and L1-loss are also used
to train the network. However, for the purpose of illustration, we show only adversarial loss in this ﬁgure.

forwarded through 3 × 3 convolutional layer to generate
output images at different resolutions. As shown in Fig 2,
output images are generated at three resolution levels:
64 × 64, 128 × 128 and 256 × 256 for both generators
GA and GB. Further,
three separate discriminator sub-
networks are employed to provide adversarial feedback
to the generators. By doing so, we are providing supervi-
sion directly to hidden layers of the network which will
enable implicit iterative reﬁnement of the feature maps
resulting in high-quality synthesis. For simplicity, images
at different resolutions are represented as: RAi, FAi, RecAi,
RBi, FBi, and RecBi, where i = 1, 2 and three corresponds
to resolution of 64 × 64, 128 × 128 and ﬁnal output size,
which is 256 × 256.

Thus, as shown in Fig. 2, for a photo image RA, GA
generates {FB1, FB2, FB3} as outputs. Then FB3, which is the
output at the last deconvolution layer, is sent as input to GB
resulting in three reconstructions {RecA1,RecA2,RecA3}.
Similarly, for a sketch input, GB will output {FA1,FA2,FA3}.
And GA will produce {RecB1,RecB2,RecB3} by taking FA3
as input. We then add supervision at these different outputs
to force outputs to be closer to targets at different resolu-
tion levels. Three discriminators are deﬁned for each gen-
erator: DA64, DA128, DA256 for GA and DB64, DB128, DB256
for GB, which are applied on deconvolution layers with
resolutions of 64 × 64, 128 × 128 and 256 × 256, respec-
tively. The objective function is expressed as:

LGANAi

=EBi∼pdata(Bi)[log DAi(Bi)]

+ EA∼pdata(A)[log(1 − DAi(GA(RA))i)],

and

LGANBi

=EAi∼pdata(Ai)[log DAi(Ai)]

+ EB∼pdata(B)[log(1 − DBi(GB(RB))i)],

where (GA(RA))i = FBi, (GB(RB))i = FAi and i = 1, 2, 3
corresponds to discriminators at different levels.

To generate images which are as close to target images
as possible, we also minimize synthesis error Lsyn which
is deﬁned as the L1 difference between synthesized image

(3)

(4)

and corresponding target
image. Similar to adversarial
loss, Lsyn is minimized for all three resolution levels and
is deﬁned as:
LsynAi
LsynBi

= (cid:107)FAi − RAi(cid:107)1= (cid:107)GB(RB)i − RAi(cid:107)1
= (cid:107)FBi − RBi(cid:107)1= (cid:107)GA(RA)i − RBi(cid:107)1.

(5)

In spite of using Lsyn and the adversarial

loss, as
discussed in [49], we may have many mappings due to
the large capacity of networks. Hence, similar to [49],
the network is additionally regularized using forward-
backward consistency thereby reducing the space of pos-
sible mapping functions. This is achieved by introducing
cycle consistency losses at different resolution stages,
which are deﬁned as:

= (cid:107)RecAi − RAi(cid:107)1= (cid:107)GB(GA(RA))i − RAi(cid:107)1
= (cid:107)RecBi − RBi(cid:107)1= (cid:107)GA(GB(RB))i − RBi(cid:107)1.

The ﬁnal objective function is deﬁned as:

∑
i=1
+ λBi LsynBi

L(GA, GB, DA, DB) =

+ LGANBi

+ λAi LsynAi

).

+ ηAi LcycAi

+ ηBi LcycBi
To summarize, the ﬁnal objective function is constructed
using L1 error between synthesized and target images,
adversarial loss and cycle-consistency loss. L1 error en-
ables the network to synthesize images that are closer to
the target, however, they often result in blurry images.
Adversarial loss overcomes this issue thereby resulting in
relatively sharper images. However, the use of adversarial
loss at
the ﬁnal stage results in artifacts, which we
overcome by providing supervision to the hidden layers.
Cycle-consistency loss provides additional regularization
while learning the network parameters.

C. Network Architecture

The generator sub-networks are constructed using
stride-2 convolutions, residual blocks [10] and fractionally
strided convolutional layers. The network conﬁguration is
speciﬁed as follows:

C7S1-64, C3-128, C3-256, RB256×9, TC64, TC32,
C7S1-3, where, C7S1 − k denotes 7 × 7 Convolution-
BatchNormReLU layer with k ﬁlters and stride 1, Ck
denotes a 3 × 3 Convolution-BatchNorm-ReLU layer with
k ﬁlters, and stride 2, RBk × m denotes m residual block
that contains two 3 × 3 convolutional layers with the same
number of ﬁlters on both layers, TC denotes a 3 × 3
Transposed-Convolution-BatchNorm-ReLU layer with k
ﬁlters and stride 1
2 .

The discriminator networks are constructed using 70 ×
70 PatchGANs [11] that classify whether 70 × 70 over-
lapping image patches are real or fake. The network con-
ﬁguration is speciﬁed as: C64-C128-C256-C512, where
Ck denotes a 4 × 4 Convolution-BatchNorm-LeakyReLU
layer with k ﬁlters and stride 2.

IV. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS

In this section, experimental settings and evaluation of
the proposed method are discussed in detail. We present
the qualitative and quantitative results of the proposed
method on two popular datasets: CUFS [35] and CUFSF
[35], [46]. In addition to performance comparison with
state-of-the-art methods, ablation studies are conducted to
verify the effectiveness of various components of the pro-
posed method. Both visual and quantitative comparisons
are presented in both cases.

A. Datasets

The proposed method is evaluated on existing viewed
sketches datasets. CUHK Face Sketch database (CUFS)
[35] is a viewed sketch database which includes 188
faces from the Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK)
student database, 123 faces from the AR database [17],
and 295 faces from the XM2VTS database [18]. For each
face, there is a sketch drawn by an artist based on a photo
taken in a frontal pose under normal lighting condition,
and with a neutral expression.

CUFSF [35], [46] database includes 1,194 persons from
the FERET database [25]. For each person, there is a
face photo with lighting variation and a sketch with shape
exaggeration drawn by an artist when viewing this photo
[46]. This dataset is particularly challenging since the
photos are taken under different illumination conditions
and sketches have shape exaggeration as compared to
photos, however, the dataset is closer to forensic sketch
scenario.

Both datasets contain facial landmark coordinates which
can be easily applied for alignments. There also exist sev-
eral recent datasets without landmark information, recent
face alignment algorithms such as [23] can be applied in
the preprocessing stage.

B. Training Details

During model training procedure, each input image is
resized to the size of 256 × 256. Data augmentation is
performed on the ﬂy by adding random noise to input
images. The network is trained from scratch, similar to
the network initialization setup in [49], the learning rate
is set to 0.0002 for the ﬁrst 100 epochs, and linearly

decaying down to 0 for next 100 epochs. λi are all set
to 1 and ηi are all set to 0.7 in (III-B). Weights were
initialized from a Gaussian distribution with mean 0 and
standard deviation 0.02. The network is trained using the
Adam solver [12]. For the CUHK dataset, 188 face-sketch
pairs are divided such that 60 pairs are used for training,
28 pairs for validation and 100 pairs for testing. We
augmented training set by horizontally ﬂipping images so
that training set has 120 images in total. For the CUFSF
dataset, 1194 image pairs are divided to 600 for training,
297 for validation and 297 for testing. All images are pre-
processed by simply aligning center of the eyes to the
ﬁxed position and cropping to the size of 200 × 250.

C. Ablation Study

To demonstrate the advantage of our multi-adversarial
network structure over the single adversarial approach, we
compare the results of the following network conﬁgura-
tions on the CUHK dataset:

• C − D256: Proposed method with single discriminator

at the ﬁnal resolution level (256 × 256).

• C − D256,128: Proposed method with two discrimi-
nators at last two resolution levels (256 × 256 and
128 × 128).

• C − D256,128,64: Proposed method with two discrimi-
nators at three resolution levels (256 ×256, 128×128
and 64 × 64).

Fig. 3 shows sample results from the above conﬁg-
urations on the CUHK dataset. It can be observed that
the performance in terms of visual quality improves as
more levels of supervision are added. Similar observations
can be made using the quantitative measurements such as
SSIM [36] and FSIM [44]) as shown in Table I.

D. Comparison with state-of-the-art methods

In addition to ablation studies, the proposed method is
compared with recent state-of-the-art photo-sketch synthe-

sis methods such as MWF [48], MrFSS [21], Pix2Pix [11],
CycleGAN [49] and DualGAN [39]. Sample sketch and
photo synthesis results on the CUHK dataset are shown
in Fig. 4 and Fig. 5, respectively. It can be observed that
MrFSS synthesis results in blurred outputs. The generative
models (Pix2Pix, CycleGAN and DualGAN) overcome the
blurred effect by using adversarial loss in addition to L1
loss. However, they tend to have undesirable artifacts due
to instabilities in training while generating high-resolution
the proposed method (PS2-MAN)
images. In contrast,
is able to preserve high-frequency details and minimize
the artifacts simultaneously. Also, photo synthesis using
CycleGAN results in color distortion. A potential reason
is the lack of L1 loss while training the network. Hence,
in our case, we use L1 reconstruction error between target
and synthesized image to train the network, thus providing
the network with further regularization.

Sample sketch and photo synthesis results on the
CUFSF dataset for the generative techniques are shown

in Fig. 6 and Fig. 7, respectively. The CUFSF dataset
is particularly challenging since the sketches have over-
exaggerated features as compared to the ones present in
the real photos. It can be observed that in case of both
sketch and photo synthesis that the generative methods
(Pix2Pix, CycleGAN and DualGAN) introduce undesir-
able artifacts especially at facial features resulting. In
contrast, the proposed method is able to minimize the
artifacts while generating realistic images as compared to
the other methods.

Similar to ablation studies, we also compare the results
of all
the above methods using quantitative measures
(SSIM and FSIM) as shown in Table II. The proposed
method achieves the best results in terms of SSIM and
FSIM as compared to the other methods. Additionally, the
methods are also compared using photo-sketch face match-
ing rates using two approaches: (1) Synthesize sketches
from photos and used these synthesized sketches to match
with real sketch gallery.
(2) Synthesize photos from
sketches and use these synthesized photos to match with
real photos gallery. The matching rates were calculated
by computing the LBP features and cosine distance. The
matching rates using generative techniques on the CUHK
and CUFSF datasets for various are illustrated in Fig. 8
and 9 and respectively in terms of the Cumulative Match-
ing Characteristic (CMC) curves. Table III summarize the
rank-1 matching rates. It can be observed from Fig. 8 and
9 that the proposed method achieves best matching rates
at all ranks.

To summarize, through various experiments it is demon-
strated that the proposed method PS2-MAN is able to gen-
erate realistic results with minimal artifacts as compared
to existing methods. This is mainly due to the multi-
adversarial network used in our approach. Additionally,
the proposed method achieves signiﬁcant improvements
over the other techniques in terms of various quality
measures (such as SSIM and FSIM ) and matching rates
while generating visually appealing outputs.

V. CONCLUSION

We explored the problem of photo-sketch synthesis
using the recently introduced generative models. A novel
synthesis method using multi-adversarial networks is pre-
sented. The proposed method is developed speciﬁcally to
enable GANs to generate high resolution images. This is
achieved by providing adversarial supervision to hidden
layers of the generator sub-network. Additionally,
the
forward and backward synthesis are trained iteratively in
the CycleGAN framework, i.e., in addition to minimizing
L1 reconstruction error, cycle-consistency loss is also
used in the objective function. These additional loss func-
tions provide appropriate regularization thereby generating
high-quality and high resolution photo-sketch synthesis.
Evaluations are performed on two popular datasets and the
results are compared with recent state-of-the-art generative
the proposed
is clearly demonstrated that
methods. It
method achieves signiﬁcant
improvements in terms of
visual quality and photo/sketch matching rates.

Abstract—Synthesizing face sketches from real photos and
its inverse have many applications. However, photo/sketch
synthesis remains a challenging problem due to the fact
that photo and sketch have different characteristics. In this
work, we consider this task as an image-to-image transla-
tion problem and explore the recently popular generative
models (GANs) to generate high-quality realistic photos
from sketches and sketches from photos. Recent GAN-
based methods have shown promising results on image-to-
image translation problems and photo-to-sketch synthesis
in particular, however, they are known to have limited
abilities in generating high-resolution realistic images. To
this end, we propose a novel synthesis framework called
Photo-Sketch Synthesis using Multi-Adversarial Networks,
(PS2-MAN) that iteratively generates low resolution to high
resolution images in an adversarial way. The hidden layers of
the generator are supervised to ﬁrst generate lower resolution
images followed by implicit reﬁnement in the network to
generate higher resolution images. Furthermore, since photo-
sketch synthesis is a coupled/paired translation problem, we
leverage the pair information using CycleGAN framework.
Both Image Quality Assessment (IQA) and Photo-Sketch
Matching experiments are conducted to demonstrate the
superior performance of our framework in comparison to
existing state-of-the-art solutions. Code available at:

I. INTRODUCTION

Research on biometrics has made signiﬁcant progress
in the past few decades and face remains the most com-
monly studied biometric primarily due to convenience of
data collection. In law enforcement and criminal cases,
automatic retrieval of photos of suspects from the police
mug shot database can enable the authorities to rapidly
narrow down potential suspects [35]. In practice, photos
of suspects are usually hard to acquire and it is known that
commercial softwares or experienced artists are sought to
generate sketches of a suspect based on the description
of eyewitness. Other than the applications in security,
face photo-sketch synthesis also has several applications
in digital entertainment. Photo sketches have also become
increasingly popular among the users of smart phones and
social networks where sketches are used as proﬁle photos
or avatars. Thus, photo-sketch synthesis and matching are
important and practical problems.

Earlier studies on face photo-sketch matching have
focused on directly matching photos to sketches and vice
versa [35]. However, due to differences in style and
appearance of photo and sketch, it is not practical to

directly perform matching between the two modalities.
A common approach to reduce this domain gap between
photo and sketch is to perform face photo-synthesis tech-
nique prior to matching. Several algorithms are proposed
on this topic in the literature. Existing approaches can
be generally classiﬁed into four categories based on the
types of sketches used[22]: (i) hand-drawn viewed sketch
[35],[48], (ii) hand-drawn semi-forensic sketch [19], (iii)
hand-drawn forensic sketch [14], [15], and (iv) software-
generated composite sketch [9].

Several works have successfully exploited Convolu-
tional Neural Networks (CNNs)
to perform different
image-to-image translation tasks. Recently, generative
models such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)
[8] and Variational Auto-Encoders (VAE) [13], [26] have
been more successful in such tasks due to their powerful
generative abilities. In particular, GANs [8] have achieved
impressive results in image generation, image editing and
representation learning [28], [40], [24], [4], [41]. Recent
studies also adopt
the original method for conditional
image generation tasks such as image-to-image translation
[11]. While Isola et al.([11]) considered paired data for
learning the image-to-image translation, Zhu et al.[49]
and Yi et al.[39] separately proposed unsupervised image-
to-image translation methods without the use of paired
data. Similar to [11], [39] and [49], in this work, face
photo-sketch synthesis is considered as an image-to-image
translation task. In fact, Yi et al.[39] presented some
preliminary results speciﬁcally for photo-sketch synthesis.
On evaluating these methods in detail for our task, it

was found that they had limitations in generating higher
resolution images (as shown in Fig.1). As argued in [42],
it is difﬁcult to train GANs to generate high-resolution
realistic images as they tend to generate images with
artifacts. This is attributed to the fact that as pixel space
dimension increases, the overlap between natural distribu-
tion of images and learned model distribution reduces. To
overcome this issue, a novel high-quality face photo-sketch
synthesis framework based on GANs is proposed. Since
in our task, both photo-to-sketch synthesis and sketch-to-
photo synthesis have practical applications, we adopt the
recently introduced CycleGAN [49] framework. Similar to
[49], the proposed method has two generators GA and GB
which generate sketch from photo and photo from sketch,
respectively. In contrast to [49], two major differences can
be noted: 1) To address the issue of artifacts in high-
resolution image generation, we propose the use of multi-
discriminator network. 2) While CycleGAN uses only
cycle-consistency loss, we additionally use L1 reconstruc-
tion error between generated output and target image. The
use of additional loss functions behaves as a regularization
during the learning process.

Existing GANs use generators that are constructed
similar to encoder-decoder style where the input image
is ﬁrst forwarded through a series of convolutions, non-
linearities and max-pooling resulting in lower resolution
feature maps which are then forwarded through a series
of deconvolutions and non-linearities. Noting that
the
deconvolutions iteratively learn the weights to upsample
the feature maps, this implicit presence of feature maps
at different resolutions is leveraged in this work by ap-
plying adversarial supervision at every level of resolution.
Speciﬁcally, the feature maps at every deconvolution layer
are convolved using 3 × 3 convolutions to produce outputs
at different resolutions (3 in particular). A discriminator
network is introduced at every resolution. By doing so,
supervision is provided directly to hidden layers of the
network which will enable iterative reﬁnement of the
feature maps and hence the output image. To summarize,
this paper makes the following contributions:

• A novel face photo-sketch synthesis framework based
on GANs involving multi-adversarial networks where
adversarial supervision is provided to hidden layers
of the network.

• While [39] and [27] present generic adversarial meth-
ods to perform image-to-image translation and show
some preliminary results on face photo-sketch syn-
thesis, to the best of our knowledge, ours is the ﬁrst
work to study in detail the use of adversarial networks
speciﬁcally for face photo-sketch synthesis.

• Detailed experiments are conducted to demonstrate
improvements in the synthesis results. Further, abla-
tion studies are conducted to verify the effectiveness
of iterative synthesis.

II. RELATED WORK

In this section, previous work on face photo-sketch
synthesis and generative modeling techniques that are

applied for image-to-image translation tasks are reviewed.

A. Face photo-sketch synthesis

Existing works can be categorized based on multiple
factors. Wang et al.[34] categorize photo-sketch synthesis
methods based on model construction techniques into
three main classes: 1) subspace learning-based, 2) sparse
representation-based, and 3) Bayesian inference-based ap-
proaches. Peng et al.[20] perform the categorization based
on representation strategies and come up with three broad
approaches: 1) holistic image-based, 2) independent local
patch-based, and 3) local patch with spatial constraints-
based methods.

Subspace learning based methods involve the use of
linear and non-linear subspace methods such as Principal
Component Analysis (PCA) and Local Linear Embedding
(LLE). Tang and Wang [30], [29] assume linear mapping
between photo and sketch and synthesized the sketch by
taking a linear combination of the Eigen vectors of sketch
images. Finding that the assumption of linear mapping
to be unreasonable, Liu et al.[16] proposed a non-linear
method based on LLE where they perform a patch-based
sketch synthesis. The input photo image is divided into
overlapping patches and transformed to corresponding
sketch patches using the LLE method. The whole sketch
image is then obtained by averaging the overlapping areas
between neighboring sketch patches. However, it leads to
blurring effect and ignores the neighboring relationships
among the patches and thus is unable to take advantage
of global structure. This work was extended by Wang et
al.[32], Gao et al.[6] and Change et al.[1] using sparse
representation-based techniques. In a different approach,
several methods were developed using Bayesian inference
techniques. Gao et al.[7] and Xiao et al.[38] employed
Hidden Markov Model (HMMs) to model non-linear rela-
tionship between sketches and photos. Wang and Tang [35]
proposed Markov Random Field (MRF) based technique
to incorporate relationship among neighboring patches.
Zhou et al.[48] improved over [35] by proposing Markov
weight ﬁelds (MWF) model that is capable of synthesizing
new target patches not existing in the training set. Wang
et al. [33] proposed a novel face sketch synthesis method
based on transductive learning.

More recently, Peng et al.[21] proposed a multiple
representations-based face sketch photo-synthesis method
that adaptively combines multiple representations to repre-
sent an image patch by combining multiple features from
face images processed using multiple ﬁlters. Additionally,
they employ Markov networks to model the relationship
between neighboring patches. Zhang et al.[45] employed
a sparse representation-based greedy search strategy to
ﬁrst estimate an initial sketch. Candidate image patches
from the initial estimated sketch and the template sketch
are then selected using multi-scale features. These can-
didate patches are reﬁned and assembled to obtain the
ﬁnal sketch which is further enhanced using a cascaded
regression strategy. Peng et al.[20] proposed a superpixel-
based synthesis method involving two stage synthesis

procedure. Wang et al.[31] recently proposed the use
of Bayesian framework consisting of neighbor selection
model and weight computation model. They consider spa-
tial neighboring constraint between adjacent image patches
for both models in contrast to existing methods where
the adjacency constraint is considered for only one of
the models. CNN-based method such as [5] and [2] were
proposed recently showing promising results. There is also
a recent work on face synthesis from facial attribute [3]
applying sketch to photo synthesis as a second stage in
their approach.

B. Image-to-image translation

In contrast to the traditional methods for photo-sketch
synthesis, several researchers have exploited the success
of CNNs for synthesis and cross-domain photo-sketch
recognition. Face photo-sketch synthesis is considered as
an image-to-image translation problem. Zhang et al.[43]
proposed an end-to-end fully convolutional network-based
photo-sketch synthesis method. Several methods have been
developed for related tasks such as general sketch synthe-
sis [27], photo-caricature translation [47] and creation of
parameterized avatars [37].

In this work, we explore generative modeling techniques
which have been highly successful for several
image-
to-image translation tasks. GANs [8], [49] and VAEs
[26], [13] are two recently popular classes of generative
techniques. GANs [8] are used to synthesize realistic
images by learning the distribution of training images.
GANs, motivated by game theory, consist of two compet-
ing networks: generator G and discriminator D. The goal
of GAN is to train G to produce samples from training
distribution such that the synthesized samples are indistin-
guishable from actual distribution by discriminator D. In
another variant called Conditional GAN , the generator is
conditioned on additional variables such as discrete labels,
text and images [11]. Recently, several variants based on
original GAN have been proposed for image-to-image
translation tasks. Isola et al.[11] proposed Conditional
GANs for several tasks such as labels to street scenes,
labels to facades, image colorization, etc. In an another
variant, Zhu et al.[49] proposed CycleGAN that learns
image-to-image translation in an unsupervised fashion.
Similar to the above approach, Yi et al.[39] proposed an
unsupervised method to perform translation tasks based
on unpaired data.

III. PROPOSED METHOD

In this section, the problem formulation is presented
followed by a detailed description of the proposed method
PS2-MAN. Also, details of generator’s and discriminator’s
network architecture are provided.

A. Formulation

Given a dataset (D) consisting of a set of face photo-
sketch pairs represented by {(Ai, Bi)}N
the goal of
photo-sketch synthesis is to learn two functions: (1)
B(cid:48)= f ps(A) that represents photo (A) to sketch (B) synthesis
and (2) A(cid:48)= fsp(B) that represents sketch (B) to photo

i=1,

(A) synthesis. In this work, we consider this problem as
an image-to-image translation task. Since both forward
(photo to sketch) and inverse (sketch to photo) transforma-
tions are of equal practical importance, this problem can be
easily accommodated into the CycleGAN [49] framework.
Similar to [49],
the proposed method consists of two
generator sub-networks GA and GB which transform from
photo to sketch and from sketch to photo, respectively. GA
takes in a real face photo image RA as input and produces
synthesized (fake) sketch FB as output. The aim of GB is
to transform sketch to photo, hence, it should transform
FB back to input photo itself, which we represent as RecA
here. Thus, the general process can be expressed as:

(1)

(2)

FB = GA(RA), RecA = GB(FB).

Similarly, sketch to photo generation can be expressed as:

FA = GB(RB), RecB = GA(FA),

where RB, FA and RecB are real sketch, synthesized
(fake) photo, and reconstructed sketch from fake photo,
respectively. Note that in the following context, the term
“fake” is same as “synthesized”.

B. Objective

As in GAN framework [8], the generators (GA and
GB) are trained using adversarial losses that come from
discriminator sub-networks. The goal of the generator
sub-networks is to produce images that are as realistic
as possible so as to fool the discriminator sub-networks,
where as the goal of the discriminator sub-networks is to
learn to classify between generated and real samples. The
use of adversarial loss is known to overcome the issue of
blurred outputs that is often encountered when only L1
or L2 loss is minimized [11]. In theory, GANs can learn
a mapping that produce outputs identically distributed as
target domain and although generic image-to-image trans-
lation GANs have been successful in generating visually
appealing results, they tend to produce artifacts in the
output (as shown in Fig 1) which adversely affects the
face/sketch matching performance. Hence, it is crucial to
generate outputs that are free from artifacts.

As discussed in [42], these artifacts arise due to known
training instabilities while generating high-resolution im-
ages. These instabilities are potentially caused due to
the fact that the supports of natural image distribution
and implied model distribution may not overlap in high-
dimensional space. The severity of this problem increases
with an increase in the image resolution. Thus, to avoid
these artifacts while generating realistic images, we pro-
pose a stage-by-stage multi-scale reﬁnement framework
by leveraging the implicit presence of features maps of
different resolutions in the generator sub-network. Consid-
ering that most GAN frameworks have generators similar
to encoder-decoder style with a stack of convolutional and
max-pooling layers followed by a series of deconvolution
layers. The deconvolution layers sequentially upsample
the feature maps from lower resolution to higher resolu-
tion. Feature maps from every deconvolutional layers are

Figure 2: Network structure of the proposed PS2-MAN framework. Adversarial supervision is provided through multiple
discriminators at the hidden layers. Note that, in addition to adversarial loss, cycle-consistency and L1-loss are also used
to train the network. However, for the purpose of illustration, we show only adversarial loss in this ﬁgure.

forwarded through 3 × 3 convolutional layer to generate
output images at different resolutions. As shown in Fig 2,
output images are generated at three resolution levels:
64 × 64, 128 × 128 and 256 × 256 for both generators
GA and GB. Further,
three separate discriminator sub-
networks are employed to provide adversarial feedback
to the generators. By doing so, we are providing supervi-
sion directly to hidden layers of the network which will
enable implicit iterative reﬁnement of the feature maps
resulting in high-quality synthesis. For simplicity, images
at different resolutions are represented as: RAi, FAi, RecAi,
RBi, FBi, and RecBi, where i = 1, 2 and three corresponds
to resolution of 64 × 64, 128 × 128 and ﬁnal output size,
which is 256 × 256.

Thus, as shown in Fig. 2, for a photo image RA, GA
generates {FB1, FB2, FB3} as outputs. Then FB3, which is the
output at the last deconvolution layer, is sent as input to GB
resulting in three reconstructions {RecA1,RecA2,RecA3}.
Similarly, for a sketch input, GB will output {FA1,FA2,FA3}.
And GA will produce {RecB1,RecB2,RecB3} by taking FA3
as input. We then add supervision at these different outputs
to force outputs to be closer to targets at different resolu-
tion levels. Three discriminators are deﬁned for each gen-
erator: DA64, DA128, DA256 for GA and DB64, DB128, DB256
for GB, which are applied on deconvolution layers with
resolutions of 64 × 64, 128 × 128 and 256 × 256, respec-
tively. The objective function is expressed as:

LGANAi

=EBi∼pdata(Bi)[log DAi(Bi)]

+ EA∼pdata(A)[log(1 − DAi(GA(RA))i)],

and

LGANBi

=EAi∼pdata(Ai)[log DAi(Ai)]

+ EB∼pdata(B)[log(1 − DBi(GB(RB))i)],

where (GA(RA))i = FBi, (GB(RB))i = FAi and i = 1, 2, 3
corresponds to discriminators at different levels.

To generate images which are as close to target images
as possible, we also minimize synthesis error Lsyn which
is deﬁned as the L1 difference between synthesized image

(3)

(4)

and corresponding target
image. Similar to adversarial
loss, Lsyn is minimized for all three resolution levels and
is deﬁned as:
LsynAi
LsynBi

= (cid:107)FAi − RAi(cid:107)1= (cid:107)GB(RB)i − RAi(cid:107)1
= (cid:107)FBi − RBi(cid:107)1= (cid:107)GA(RA)i − RBi(cid:107)1.

(5)

In spite of using Lsyn and the adversarial

loss, as
discussed in [49], we may have many mappings due to
the large capacity of networks. Hence, similar to [49],
the network is additionally regularized using forward-
backward consistency thereby reducing the space of pos-
sible mapping functions. This is achieved by introducing
cycle consistency losses at different resolution stages,
which are deﬁned as:

= (cid:107)RecAi − RAi(cid:107)1= (cid:107)GB(GA(RA))i − RAi(cid:107)1
= (cid:107)RecBi − RBi(cid:107)1= (cid:107)GA(GB(RB))i − RBi(cid:107)1.

LcycAi
LcycBi
The ﬁnal objective function is deﬁned as:

∑
i=1
+ λBi LsynBi

L(GA, GB, DA, DB) =

+ LGANBi

+ λAi LsynAi

).

+ ηAi LcycAi

+ ηBi LcycBi
To summarize, the ﬁnal objective function is constructed
using L1 error between synthesized and target images,
adversarial loss and cycle-consistency loss. L1 error en-
ables the network to synthesize images that are closer to
the target, however, they often result in blurry images.
Adversarial loss overcomes this issue thereby resulting in
relatively sharper images. However, the use of adversarial
loss at
the ﬁnal stage results in artifacts, which we
overcome by providing supervision to the hidden layers.
Cycle-consistency loss provides additional regularization
while learning the network parameters.

C. Network Architecture

The generator sub-networks are constructed using
stride-2 convolutions, residual blocks [10] and fractionally
strided convolutional layers. The network conﬁguration is
speciﬁed as follows:

C7S1-64, C3-128, C3-256, RB256×9, TC64, TC32,
C7S1-3, where, C7S1 − k denotes 7 × 7 Convolution-
BatchNormReLU layer with k ﬁlters and stride 1, Ck
denotes a 3 × 3 Convolution-BatchNorm-ReLU layer with
k ﬁlters, and stride 2, RBk × m denotes m residual block
that contains two 3 × 3 convolutional layers with the same
number of ﬁlters on both layers, TC denotes a 3 × 3
Transposed-Convolution-BatchNorm-ReLU layer with k
ﬁlters and stride 1
2 .

The discriminator networks are constructed using 70 ×
70 PatchGANs [11] that classify whether 70 × 70 over-
lapping image patches are real or fake. The network con-
ﬁguration is speciﬁed as: C64-C128-C256-C512, where
Ck denotes a 4 × 4 Convolution-BatchNorm-LeakyReLU
layer with k ﬁlters and stride 2.

IV. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS

In this section, experimental settings and evaluation of
the proposed method are discussed in detail. We present
the qualitative and quantitative results of the proposed
method on two popular datasets: CUFS [35] and CUFSF
[35], [46]. In addition to performance comparison with
state-of-the-art methods, ablation studies are conducted to
verify the effectiveness of various components of the pro-
posed method. Both visual and quantitative comparisons
are presented in both cases.

A. Datasets

The proposed method is evaluated on existing viewed
sketches datasets. CUHK Face Sketch database (CUFS)
[35] is a viewed sketch database which includes 188
faces from the Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK)
student database, 123 faces from the AR database [17],
and 295 faces from the XM2VTS database [18]. For each
face, there is a sketch drawn by an artist based on a photo
taken in a frontal pose under normal lighting condition,
and with a neutral expression.

CUFSF [35], [46] database includes 1,194 persons from
the FERET database [25]. For each person, there is a
face photo with lighting variation and a sketch with shape
exaggeration drawn by an artist when viewing this photo
[46]. This dataset is particularly challenging since the
photos are taken under different illumination conditions
and sketches have shape exaggeration as compared to
photos, however, the dataset is closer to forensic sketch
scenario.

Both datasets contain facial landmark coordinates which
can be easily applied for alignments. There also exist sev-
eral recent datasets without landmark information, recent
face alignment algorithms such as [23] can be applied in
the preprocessing stage.

B. Training Details

During model training procedure, each input image is
resized to the size of 256 × 256. Data augmentation is
performed on the ﬂy by adding random noise to input
images. The network is trained from scratch, similar to
the network initialization setup in [49], the learning rate
is set to 0.0002 for the ﬁrst 100 epochs, and linearly

decaying down to 0 for next 100 epochs. λi are all set
to 1 and ηi are all set to 0.7 in (III-B). Weights were
initialized from a Gaussian distribution with mean 0 and
standard deviation 0.02. The network is trained using the
Adam solver [12]. For the CUHK dataset, 188 face-sketch
pairs are divided such that 60 pairs are used for training,
28 pairs for validation and 100 pairs for testing. We
augmented training set by horizontally ﬂipping images so
that training set has 120 images in total. For the CUFSF
dataset, 1194 image pairs are divided to 600 for training,
297 for validation and 297 for testing. All images are pre-
processed by simply aligning center of the eyes to the
ﬁxed position and cropping to the size of 200 × 250.

from (e) that the artifacts are minimized and the results

C. Ablation Study

To demonstrate the advantage of our multi-adversarial
network structure over the single adversarial approach, we
compare the results of the following network conﬁgura-
tions on the CUHK dataset:

• C − D256: Proposed method with single discriminator

at the ﬁnal resolution level (256 × 256).

• C − D256,128: Proposed method with two discrimi-
nators at last two resolution levels (256 × 256 and
128 × 128).

• C − D256,128,64: Proposed method with two discrimi-
nators at three resolution levels (256 ×256, 128×128
and 64 × 64).

Fig. 3 shows sample results from the above conﬁg-
urations on the CUHK dataset. It can be observed that
the performance in terms of visual quality improves as
more levels of supervision are added. Similar observations
can be made using the quantitative measurements such as
SSIM [36] and FSIM [44]) as shown in Table I.

D. Comparison with state-of-the-art methods

In addition to ablation studies, the proposed method is
compared with recent state-of-the-art photo-sketch synthe-

sis methods such as MWF [48], MrFSS [21], Pix2Pix [11],
CycleGAN [49] and DualGAN [39]. Sample sketch and
photo synthesis results on the CUHK dataset are shown
in Fig. 4 and Fig. 5, respectively. It can be observed that
MrFSS synthesis results in blurred outputs. The generative
models (Pix2Pix, CycleGAN and DualGAN) overcome the
blurred effect by using adversarial loss in addition to L1
loss. However, they tend to have undesirable artifacts due
to instabilities in training while generating high-resolution
the proposed method (PS2-MAN)
images. In contrast,
is able to preserve high-frequency details and minimize
the artifacts simultaneously. Also, photo synthesis using
CycleGAN results in color distortion. A potential reason
is the lack of L1 loss while training the network. Hence,
in our case, we use L1 reconstruction error between target
and synthesized image to train the network, thus providing
the network with further regularization.

Sample sketch and photo synthesis results on the
CUFSF dataset for the generative techniques are shown

in Fig. 6 and Fig. 7, respectively. The CUFSF dataset
is particularly challenging since the sketches have over-
exaggerated features as compared to the ones present in
the real photos. It can be observed that in case of both
sketch and photo synthesis that the generative methods
(Pix2Pix, CycleGAN and DualGAN) introduce undesir-
able artifacts especially at facial features resulting. In
contrast, the proposed method is able to minimize the
artifacts while generating realistic images as compared to
the other methods.

Similar to ablation studies, we also compare the results
of all
the above methods using quantitative measures
(SSIM and FSIM) as shown in Table II. The proposed
method achieves the best results in terms of SSIM and
FSIM as compared to the other methods. Additionally, the
methods are also compared using photo-sketch face match-
ing rates using two approaches: (1) Synthesize sketches
from photos and used these synthesized sketches to match
with real sketch gallery.
(2) Synthesize photos from
sketches and use these synthesized photos to match with
real photos gallery. The matching rates were calculated
by computing the LBP features and cosine distance. The
matching rates using generative techniques on the CUHK
and CUFSF datasets for various are illustrated in Fig. 8
and 9 and respectively in terms of the Cumulative Match-
ing Characteristic (CMC) curves. Table III summarize the
rank-1 matching rates. It can be observed from Fig. 8 and
9 that the proposed method achieves best matching rates
at all ranks.

To summarize, through various experiments it is demon-
strated that the proposed method PS2-MAN is able to gen-
erate realistic results with minimal artifacts as compared
to existing methods. This is mainly due to the multi-
adversarial network used in our approach. Additionally,
the proposed method achieves signiﬁcant improvements
over the other techniques in terms of various quality
measures (such as SSIM and FSIM ) and matching rates
while generating visually appealing outputs.

V. CONCLUSION

We explored the problem of photo-sketch synthesis
using the recently introduced generative models. A novel
synthesis method using multi-adversarial networks is pre-
sented. The proposed method is developed speciﬁcally to
enable GANs to generate high resolution images. This is
achieved by providing adversarial supervision to hidden
layers of the generator sub-network. Additionally,
the
forward and backward synthesis are trained iteratively in
the CycleGAN framework, i.e., in addition to minimizing
L1 reconstruction error, cycle-consistency loss is also
used in the objective function. These additional loss func-
tions provide appropriate regularization thereby generating
high-quality and high resolution photo-sketch synthesis.
Evaluations are performed on two popular datasets and the
results are compared with recent state-of-the-art generative
the proposed
is clearly demonstrated that
methods. It
method achieves signiﬁcant
improvements in terms of
visual quality and photo/sketch matching rates.

Abstract—Synthesizing face sketches from real photos and
its inverse have many applications. However, photo/sketch
synthesis remains a challenging problem due to the fact
that photo and sketch have different characteristics. In this
work, we consider this task as an image-to-image transla-
tion problem and explore the recently popular generative
models (GANs) to generate high-quality realistic photos
from sketches and sketches from photos. Recent GAN-
based methods have shown promising results on image-to-
image translation problems and photo-to-sketch synthesis
in particular, however, they are known to have limited
abilities in generating high-resolution realistic images. To
this end, we propose a novel synthesis framework called
Photo-Sketch Synthesis using Multi-Adversarial Networks,
(PS2-MAN) that iteratively generates low resolution to high
resolution images in an adversarial way. The hidden layers of
the generator are supervised to ﬁrst generate lower resolution
images followed by implicit reﬁnement in the network to
generate higher resolution images. Furthermore, since photo-
sketch synthesis is a coupled/paired translation problem, we
leverage the pair information using CycleGAN framework.
Both Image Quality Assessment (IQA) and Photo-Sketch
Matching experiments are conducted to demonstrate the
superior performance of our framework in comparison to
existing state-of-the-art solutions. Code available at:

I. INTRODUCTION

Research on biometrics has made signiﬁcant progress
in the past few decades and face remains the most com-
monly studied biometric primarily due to convenience of
data collection. In law enforcement and criminal cases,
automatic retrieval of photos of suspects from the police
mug shot database can enable the authorities to rapidly
narrow down potential suspects [35]. In practice, photos
of suspects are usually hard to acquire and it is known that
commercial softwares or experienced artists are sought to
generate sketches of a suspect based on the description
of eyewitness. Other than the applications in security,
face photo-sketch synthesis also has several applications
in digital entertainment. Photo sketches have also become
increasingly popular among the users of smart phones and
social networks where sketches are used as proﬁle photos
or avatars. Thus, photo-sketch synthesis and matching are
important and practical problems.

Earlier studies on face photo-sketch matching have
focused on directly matching photos to sketches and vice
versa [35]. However, due to differences in style and
appearance of photo and sketch, it is not practical to

directly perform matching between the two modalities.
A common approach to reduce this domain gap between
photo and sketch is to perform face photo-synthesis tech-
nique prior to matching. Several algorithms are proposed
on this topic in the literature. Existing approaches can
be generally classiﬁed into four categories based on the
types of sketches used[22]: (i) hand-drawn viewed sketch
[35],[48], (ii) hand-drawn semi-forensic sketch [19], (iii)
hand-drawn forensic sketch [14], [15], and (iv) software-
generated composite sketch [9].

Several works have successfully exploited Convolu-
tional Neural Networks (CNNs)
to perform different
image-to-image translation tasks. Recently, generative
models such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)
[8] and Variational Auto-Encoders (VAE) [13], [26] have
been more successful in such tasks due to their powerful
generative abilities. In particular, GANs [8] have achieved
impressive results in image generation, image editing and
representation learning [28], [40], [24], [4], [41]. Recent
studies also adopt
the original method for conditional
image generation tasks such as image-to-image translation
[11]. While Isola et al.([11]) considered paired data for
learning the image-to-image translation, Zhu et al.[49]
and Yi et al.[39] separately proposed unsupervised image-
to-image translation methods without the use of paired
data. Similar to [11], [39] and [49], in this work, face
photo-sketch synthesis is considered as an image-to-image
translation task. In fact, Yi et al.[39] presented some
preliminary results speciﬁcally for photo-sketch synthesis.
On evaluating these methods in detail for our task, it

was found that they had limitations in generating higher
resolution images (as shown in Fig.1). As argued in [42],
it is difﬁcult to train GANs to generate high-resolution
realistic images as they tend to generate images with
artifacts. This is attributed to the fact that as pixel space
dimension increases, the overlap between natural distribu-
tion of images and learned model distribution reduces. To
overcome this issue, a novel high-quality face photo-sketch
synthesis framework based on GANs is proposed. Since
in our task, both photo-to-sketch synthesis and sketch-to-
photo synthesis have practical applications, we adopt the
recently introduced CycleGAN [49] framework. Similar to
[49], the proposed method has two generators GA and GB
which generate sketch from photo and photo from sketch,
respectively. In contrast to [49], two major differences can
be noted: 1) To address the issue of artifacts in high-
resolution image generation, we propose the use of multi-
discriminator network. 2) While CycleGAN uses only
cycle-consistency loss, we additionally use L1 reconstruc-
tion error between generated output and target image. The
use of additional loss functions behaves as a regularization
during the learning process.

Existing GANs use generators that are constructed
similar to encoder-decoder style where the input image
is ﬁrst forwarded through a series of convolutions, non-
linearities and max-pooling resulting in lower resolution
feature maps which are then forwarded through a series
of deconvolutions and non-linearities. Noting that
the
deconvolutions iteratively learn the weights to upsample
the feature maps, this implicit presence of feature maps
at different resolutions is leveraged in this work by ap-
plying adversarial supervision at every level of resolution.
Speciﬁcally, the feature maps at every deconvolution layer
are convolved using 3 × 3 convolutions to produce outputs
at different resolutions (3 in particular). A discriminator
network is introduced at every resolution. By doing so,
supervision is provided directly to hidden layers of the
network which will enable iterative reﬁnement of the
feature maps and hence the output image. To summarize,
this paper makes the following contributions:

• A novel face photo-sketch synthesis framework based
on GANs involving multi-adversarial networks where
adversarial supervision is provided to hidden layers
of the network.

• While [39] and [27] present generic adversarial meth-
ods to perform image-to-image translation and show
some preliminary results on face photo-sketch syn-
thesis, to the best of our knowledge, ours is the ﬁrst
work to study in detail the use of adversarial networks
speciﬁcally for face photo-sketch synthesis.

• Detailed experiments are conducted to demonstrate
improvements in the synthesis results. Further, abla-
tion studies are conducted to verify the effectiveness
of iterative synthesis.

II. RELATED WORK

In this section, previous work on face photo-sketch
synthesis and generative modeling techniques that are

applied for image-to-image translation tasks are reviewed.

A. Face photo-sketch synthesis

Existing works can be categorized based on multiple
factors. Wang et al.[34] categorize photo-sketch synthesis
methods based on model construction techniques into
three main classes: 1) subspace learning-based, 2) sparse
representation-based, and 3) Bayesian inference-based ap-
proaches. Peng et al.[20] perform the categorization based
on representation strategies and come up with three broad
approaches: 1) holistic image-based, 2) independent local
patch-based, and 3) local patch with spatial constraints-
based methods.

Subspace learning based methods involve the use of
linear and non-linear subspace methods such as Principal
Component Analysis (PCA) and Local Linear Embedding
(LLE). Tang and Wang [30], [29] assume linear mapping
between photo and sketch and synthesized the sketch by
taking a linear combination of the Eigen vectors of sketch
images. Finding that the assumption of linear mapping
to be unreasonable, Liu et al.[16] proposed a non-linear
method based on LLE where they perform a patch-based
sketch synthesis. The input photo image is divided into
overlapping patches and transformed to corresponding
sketch patches using the LLE method. The whole sketch
image is then obtained by averaging the overlapping areas
between neighboring sketch patches. However, it leads to
blurring effect and ignores the neighboring relationships
among the patches and thus is unable to take advantage
of global structure. This work was extended by Wang et
al.[32], Gao et al.[6] and Change et al.[1] using sparse
representation-based techniques. In a different approach,
several methods were developed using Bayesian inference
techniques. Gao et al.[7] and Xiao et al.[38] employed
Hidden Markov Model (HMMs) to model non-linear rela-
tionship between sketches and photos. Wang and Tang [35]
proposed Markov Random Field (MRF) based technique
to incorporate relationship among neighboring patches.
Zhou et al.[48] improved over [35] by proposing Markov
weight ﬁelds (MWF) model that is capable of synthesizing
new target patches not existing in the training set. Wang
et al. [33] proposed a novel face sketch synthesis method
based on transductive learning.

More recently, Peng et al.[21] proposed a multiple
representations-based face sketch photo-synthesis method
that adaptively combines multiple representations to repre-
sent an image patch by combining multiple features from
face images processed using multiple ﬁlters. Additionally,
they employ Markov networks to model the relationship
between neighboring patches. Zhang et al.[45] employed
a sparse representation-based greedy search strategy to
ﬁrst estimate an initial sketch. Candidate image patches
from the initial estimated sketch and the template sketch
are then selected using multi-scale features. These can-
didate patches are reﬁned and assembled to obtain the
ﬁnal sketch which is further enhanced using a cascaded
regression strategy. Peng et al.[20] proposed a superpixel-
based synthesis method involving two stage synthesis

procedure. Wang et al.[31] recently proposed the use
of Bayesian framework consisting of neighbor selection
model and weight computation model. They consider spa-
tial neighboring constraint between adjacent image patches
for both models in contrast to existing methods where
the adjacency constraint is considered for only one of
the models. CNN-based method such as [5] and [2] were
proposed recently showing promising results. There is also
a recent work on face synthesis from facial attribute [3]
applying sketch to photo synthesis as a second stage in
their approach.

B. Image-to-image translation

In contrast to the traditional methods for photo-sketch
synthesis, several researchers have exploited the success
of CNNs for synthesis and cross-domain photo-sketch
recognition. Face photo-sketch synthesis is considered as
an image-to-image translation problem. Zhang et al.[43]
proposed an end-to-end fully convolutional network-based
photo-sketch synthesis method. Several methods have been
developed for related tasks such as general sketch synthe-
sis [27], photo-caricature translation [47] and creation of
parameterized avatars [37].

In this work, we explore generative modeling techniques
which have been highly successful for several
image-
to-image translation tasks. GANs [8], [49] and VAEs
[26], [13] are two recently popular classes of generative
techniques. GANs [8] are used to synthesize realistic
images by learning the distribution of training images.
GANs, motivated by game theory, consist of two compet-
ing networks: generator G and discriminator D. The goal
of GAN is to train G to produce samples from training
distribution such that the synthesized samples are indistin-
guishable from actual distribution by discriminator D. In
another variant called Conditional GAN , the generator is
conditioned on additional variables such as discrete labels,
text and images [11]. Recently, several variants based on
original GAN have been proposed for image-to-image
translation tasks. Isola et al.[11] proposed Conditional
GANs for several tasks such as labels to street scenes,
labels to facades, image colorization, etc. In an another
variant, Zhu et al.[49] proposed CycleGAN that learns
image-to-image translation in an unsupervised fashion.
Similar to the above approach, Yi et al.[39] proposed an
unsupervised method to perform translation tasks based
on unpaired data.

III. PROPOSED METHOD

In this section, the problem formulation is presented
followed by a detailed description of the proposed method
PS2-MAN. Also, details of generator’s and discriminator’s
network architecture are provided.

A. Formulation

sketch pairs represented by {(Ai, Bi)}N

photo-sketch synthesis is to learn two functions: (1)
B(cid:48)= f ps(A) that represents photo (A) to sketch (B) synthesis
and (2) A(cid:48)= fsp(B) that represents sketch (B) to photo

i=1,

(A) synthesis. In this work, we consider this problem as
an image-to-image translation task. Since both forward
(photo to sketch) and inverse (sketch to photo) transforma-
tions are of equal practical importance, this problem can be
easily accommodated into the CycleGAN [49] framework.
Similar to [49],
the proposed method consists of two
generator sub-networks GA and GB which transform from
photo to sketch and from sketch to photo, respectively. GA
takes in a real face photo image RA as input and produces
synthesized (fake) sketch FB as output. The aim of GB is
to transform sketch to photo, hence, it should transform
FB back to input photo itself, which we represent as RecA
here. Thus, the general process can be expressed as:

(1)

(2)

FB = GA(RA), RecA = GB(FB).

Similarly, sketch to photo generation can be expressed as:

FA = GB(RB), RecB = GA(FA),

where RB, FA and RecB are real sketch, synthesized
(fake) photo, and reconstructed sketch from fake photo,
respectively. Note that in the following context, the term
“fake” is same as “synthesized”.

B. Objective

As in GAN framework [8], the generators (GA and
GB) are trained using adversarial losses that come from
discriminator sub-networks. The goal of the generator
sub-networks is to produce images that are as realistic
as possible so as to fool the discriminator sub-networks,
where as the goal of the discriminator sub-networks is to
learn to classify between generated and real samples. The
use of adversarial loss is known to overcome the issue of
blurred outputs that is often encountered when only L1
or L2 loss is minimized [11]. In theory, GANs can learn
a mapping that produce outputs identically distributed as
target domain and although generic image-to-image trans-
lation GANs have been successful in generating visually
appealing results, they tend to produce artifacts in the
output (as shown in Fig 1) which adversely affects the
face/sketch matching performance. Hence, it is crucial to
generate outputs that are free from artifacts.

As discussed in [42], these artifacts arise due to known
training instabilities while generating high-resolution im-
ages. These instabilities are potentially caused due to
the fact that the supports of natural image distribution
and implied model distribution may not overlap in high-
dimensional space. The severity of this problem increases
with an increase in the image resolution. Thus, to avoid
these artifacts while generating realistic images, we pro-
pose a stage-by-stage multi-scale reﬁnement framework
by leveraging the implicit presence of features maps of
different resolutions in the generator sub-network. Consid-
ering that most GAN frameworks have generators similar
to encoder-decoder style with a stack of convolutional and
max-pooling layers followed by a series of deconvolution
layers. The deconvolution layers sequentially upsample
the feature maps from lower resolution to higher resolu-
tion. Feature maps from every deconvolutional layers are

Figure 2: Network structure of the proposed PS2-MAN framework. Adversarial supervision is provided through multiple
discriminators at the hidden layers. Note that, in addition to adversarial loss, cycle-consistency and L1-loss are also used
to train the network. However, for the purpose of illustration, we show only adversarial loss in this ﬁgure.

forwarded through 3 × 3 convolutional layer to generate
output images at different resolutions. As shown in Fig 2,
output images are generated at three resolution levels:
64 × 64, 128 × 128 and 256 × 256 for both generators
GA and GB. Further,
three separate discriminator sub-
networks are employed to provide adversarial feedback
to the generators. By doing so, we are providing supervi-
sion directly to hidden layers of the network which will
enable implicit iterative reﬁnement of the feature maps
resulting in high-quality synthesis. For simplicity, images
at different resolutions are represented as: RAi, FAi, RecAi,
RBi, FBi, and RecBi, where i = 1, 2 and three corresponds
to resolution of 64 × 64, 128 × 128 and ﬁnal output size,
which is 256 × 256.

Thus, as shown in Fig. 2, for a photo image RA, GA
generates {FB1, FB2, FB3} as outputs. Then FB3, which is the
output at the last deconvolution layer, is sent as input to GB
resulting in three reconstructions {RecA1,RecA2,RecA3}.
Similarly, for a sketch input, GB will output {FA1,FA2,FA3}.
And GA will produce {RecB1,RecB2,RecB3} by taking FA3
as input. We then add supervision at these different outputs
to force outputs to be closer to targets at different resolu-
tion levels. Three discriminators are deﬁned for each gen-
erator: DA64, DA128, DA256 for GA and DB64, DB128, DB256
for GB, which are applied on deconvolution layers with
resolutions of 64 × 64, 128 × 128 and 256 × 256, respec-
tively. The objective function is expressed as:

LGANAi

=EBi∼pdata(Bi)[log DAi(Bi)]

+ EA∼pdata(A)[log(1 − DAi(GA(RA))i)],

and

LGANBi

=EAi∼pdata(Ai)[log DAi(Ai)]

+ EB∼pdata(B)[log(1 − DBi(GB(RB))i)],

where (GA(RA))i = FBi, (GB(RB))i = FAi and i = 1, 2, 3
corresponds to discriminators at different levels.

To generate images which are as close to target images
as possible, we also minimize synthesis error Lsyn which
is deﬁned as the L1 difference between synthesized image

(3)

(4)

and corresponding target
image. Similar to adversarial
loss, Lsyn is minimized for all three resolution levels and
is deﬁned as:
LsynAi
LsynBi

= (cid:107)FAi − RAi(cid:107)1= (cid:107)GB(RB)i − RAi(cid:107)1
= (cid:107)FBi − RBi(cid:107)1= (cid:107)GA(RA)i − RBi(cid:107)1.

(5)

In spite of using Lsyn and the adversarial

loss, as
discussed in [49], we may have many mappings due to
the large capacity of networks. Hence, similar to [49],
the network is additionally regularized using forward-
backward consistency thereby reducing the space of pos-
sible mapping functions. This is achieved by introducing
cycle consistency losses at different resolution stages,
which are deﬁned as:

= (cid:107)RecAi − RAi(cid:107)1= (cid:107)GB(GA(RA))i − RAi(cid:107)1
= (cid:107)RecBi − RBi(cid:107)1= (cid:107)GA(GB(RB))i − RBi(cid:107)1.

LcycAi
LcycBi
The ﬁnal objective function is deﬁned as:

(6)

(LGANAi

∑
i=1
+ λBi LsynBi

L(GA, GB, DA, DB) =

+ LGANBi

+ λAi LsynAi

).

+ ηAi LcycAi

+ ηBi LcycBi
To summarize, the ﬁnal objective function is constructed
using L1 error between synthesized and target images,
adversarial loss and cycle-consistency loss. L1 error en-
ables the network to synthesize images that are closer to
the target, however, they often result in blurry images.
Adversarial loss overcomes this issue thereby resulting in
relatively sharper images. However, the use of adversarial
loss at
the ﬁnal stage results in artifacts, which we
overcome by providing supervision to the hidden layers.
Cycle-consistency loss provides additional regularization
while learning the network parameters.

C. Network Architecture

The generator sub-networks are constructed using
stride-2 convolutions, residual blocks [10] and fractionally
strided convolutional layers. The network conﬁguration is
speciﬁed as follows:

C7S1-64, C3-128, C3-256, RB256×9, TC64, TC32,
C7S1-3, where, C7S1 − k denotes 7 × 7 Convolution-
BatchNormReLU layer with k ﬁlters and stride 1, Ck
denotes a 3 × 3 Convolution-BatchNorm-ReLU layer with
k ﬁlters, and stride 2, RBk × m denotes m residual block
that contains two 3 × 3 convolutional layers with the same
number of ﬁlters on both layers, TC denotes a 3 × 3
Transposed-Convolution-BatchNorm-ReLU layer with k
ﬁlters and stride 1
2 .

The discriminator networks are constructed using 70 ×
70 PatchGANs [11] that classify whether 70 × 70 over-
lapping image patches are real or fake. The network con-
ﬁguration is speciﬁed as: C64-C128-C256-C512, where
Ck denotes a 4 × 4 Convolution-BatchNorm-LeakyReLU
layer with k ﬁlters and stride 2.

IV. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS

In this section, experimental settings and evaluation of
the proposed method are discussed in detail. We present
the qualitative and quantitative results of the proposed
method on two popular datasets: CUFS [35] and CUFSF
[35], [46]. In addition to performance comparison with
state-of-the-art methods, ablation studies are conducted to
verify the effectiveness of various components of the pro-
posed method. Both visual and quantitative comparisons
are presented in both cases.

A. Datasets

The proposed method is evaluated on existing viewed
sketches datasets. CUHK Face Sketch database (CUFS)
[35] is a viewed sketch database which includes 188
faces from the Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK)
student database, 123 faces from the AR database [17],
and 295 faces from the XM2VTS database [18]. For each
face, there is a sketch drawn by an artist based on a photo
taken in a frontal pose under normal lighting condition,
and with a neutral expression.

CUFSF [35], [46] database includes 1,194 persons from
the FERET database [25]. For each person, there is a
face photo with lighting variation and a sketch with shape
exaggeration drawn by an artist when viewing this photo
[46]. This dataset is particularly challenging since the
photos are taken under different illumination conditions
and sketches have shape exaggeration as compared to
photos, however, the dataset is closer to forensic sketch
scenario.

Both datasets contain facial landmark coordinates which
can be easily applied for alignments. There also exist sev-
eral recent datasets without landmark information, recent
face alignment algorithms such as [23] can be applied in
the preprocessing stage.

B. Training Details

During model training procedure, each input image is
resized to the size of 256 × 256. Data augmentation is
performed on the ﬂy by adding random noise to input
images. The network is trained from scratch, similar to
the network initialization setup in [49], the learning rate
is set to 0.0002 for the ﬁrst 100 epochs, and linearly

decaying down to 0 for next 100 epochs. λi are all set
to 1 and ηi are all set to 0.7 in (III-B). Weights were
initialized from a Gaussian distribution with mean 0 and
standard deviation 0.02. The network is trained using the
Adam solver [12]. For the CUHK dataset, 188 face-sketch
pairs are divided such that 60 pairs are used for training,
28 pairs for validation and 100 pairs for testing. We
augmented training set by horizontally ﬂipping images so
that training set has 120 images in total. For the CUFSF
dataset, 1194 image pairs are divided to 600 for training,
297 for validation and 297 for testing. All images are pre-
processed by simply aligning center of the eyes to the
ﬁxed position and cropping to the size of 200 × 250.

C. Ablation Study

To demonstrate the advantage of our multi-adversarial
network structure over the single adversarial approach, we
compare the results of the following network conﬁgura-
tions on the CUHK dataset:

• C − D256: Proposed method with single discriminator

at the ﬁnal resolution level (256 × 256).

• C − D256,128: Proposed method with two discrimi-
nators at last two resolution levels (256 × 256 and
128 × 128).

• C − D256,128,64: Proposed method with two discrimi-
nators at three resolution levels (256 ×256, 128×128
and 64 × 64).

Fig. 3 shows sample results from the above conﬁg-
urations on the CUHK dataset. It can be observed that
the performance in terms of visual quality improves as
more levels of supervision are added. Similar observations
can be made using the quantitative measurements such as
SSIM [36] and FSIM [44]) as shown in Table I.

D. Comparison with state-of-the-art methods

In addition to ablation studies, the proposed method is
compared with recent state-of-the-art photo-sketch synthe-

sis methods such as MWF [48], MrFSS [21], Pix2Pix [11],
CycleGAN [49] and DualGAN [39]. Sample sketch and
photo synthesis results on the CUHK dataset are shown
in Fig. 4 and Fig. 5, respectively. It can be observed that
MrFSS synthesis results in blurred outputs. The generative
models (Pix2Pix, CycleGAN and DualGAN) overcome the
blurred effect by using adversarial loss in addition to L1
loss. However, they tend to have undesirable artifacts due
to instabilities in training while generating high-resolution
the proposed method (PS2-MAN)
images. In contrast,
is able to preserve high-frequency details and minimize
the artifacts simultaneously. Also, photo synthesis using
CycleGAN results in color distortion. A potential reason
is the lack of L1 loss while training the network. Hence,
in our case, we use L1 reconstruction error between target
and synthesized image to train the network, thus providing
the network with further regularization.

Sample sketch and photo synthesis results on the
CUFSF dataset for the generative techniques are shown

in Fig. 6 and Fig. 7, respectively. The CUFSF dataset
is particularly challenging since the sketches have over-
exaggerated features as compared to the ones present in
the real photos. It can be observed that in case of both
sketch and photo synthesis that the generative methods
(Pix2Pix, CycleGAN and DualGAN) introduce undesir-
able artifacts especially at facial features resulting. In
contrast, the proposed method is able to minimize the
artifacts while generating realistic images as compared to
the other methods.

Similar to ablation studies, we also compare the results
of all
the above methods using quantitative measures
(SSIM and FSIM) as shown in Table II. The proposed
method achieves the best results in terms of SSIM and
FSIM as compared to the other methods. Additionally, the
methods are also compared using photo-sketch face match-
ing rates using two approaches: (1) Synthesize sketches
from photos and used these synthesized sketches to match
with real sketch gallery.
(2) Synthesize photos from
sketches and use these synthesized photos to match with
real photos gallery. The matching rates were calculated
by computing the LBP features and cosine distance. The
matching rates using generative techniques on the CUHK
and CUFSF datasets for various are illustrated in Fig. 8
and 9 and respectively in terms of the Cumulative Match-
ing Characteristic (CMC) curves. Table III summarize the
rank-1 matching rates. It can be observed from Fig. 8 and
9 that the proposed method achieves best matching rates
at all ranks.

To summarize, through various experiments it is demon-
strated that the proposed method PS2-MAN is able to gen-
erate realistic results with minimal artifacts as compared
to existing methods. This is mainly due to the multi-
adversarial network used in our approach. Additionally,
the proposed method achieves signiﬁcant improvements
over the other techniques in terms of various quality
measures (such as SSIM and FSIM ) and matching rates
while generating visually appealing outputs.

V. CONCLUSION

We explored the problem of photo-sketch synthesis
using the recently introduced generative models. A novel
synthesis method using multi-adversarial networks is pre-
sented. The proposed method is developed speciﬁcally to
enable GANs to generate high resolution images. This is
achieved by providing adversarial supervision to hidden
layers of the generator sub-network. Additionally,
the
forward and backward synthesis are trained iteratively in
the CycleGAN framework, i.e., in addition to minimizing
L1 reconstruction error, cycle-consistency loss is also
used in the objective function. These additional loss func-
tions provide appropriate regularization thereby generating
high-quality and high resolution photo-sketch synthesis.
Evaluations are performed on two popular datasets and the
results are compared with recent state-of-the-art generative
the proposed
is clearly demonstrated that
methods. It
method achieves signiﬁcant
improvements in terms of
visual quality and photo/sketch matching rates.
