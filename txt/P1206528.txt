Abstract
This paper proposes a methodology to identify and classify the semantic relations holding among the possible different answers
obtained for a certain query on DBpedia language speciﬁc chapters. The goal is to reconcile information provided by language speciﬁc
DBpedia chapters to obtain a consistent results set. Starting from the identiﬁed semantic relations between two pieces of information,
we further classify them as positive or negative, and we exploit bipolar abstract argumentation to represent the result set as a unique
graph, where using argumentation semantics we are able to detect the (possible multiple) consistent sets of elements of the query
result. We experimented with the proposed methodology over a sample of triples extracted from 10 DBpedia ontology properties. We
deﬁne the LingRel ontology to represent how the extracted information from different chapters is related to each other, and we map the
properties of the LingRel ontology to the properties of the SIOC-Argumentation ontology to built argumentation graphs. The result is a
pilot resource that can be proﬁtably used both to train and to evaluate NLP applications querying linked data in detecting the semantic
relations among the extracted values, in order to output consistent information sets.

Introduction

The Web is an information space which is evolving from
sharing textual documents to publishing structured data. In
particular, the Linked Data initiative aims at fostering the
publication and interlinking of data on the Web, giving birth
to the so called Web of Data, a dataspace where structured
data are interlinked with each other. The best known ex-
ample of Linked Data is DBpedia (Bizer et al., 2009), a
structured information dataset extracted from Wikipedia.
The advantage brought by the availability of such informa-
tion in a structured format (usually expressed in RDF1) is
that in this way sophisticated queries can be raised against
Wikipedia data to extract further information (e.g., us-
ing the SPARQL query language2), and new links to dif-
ferent datasets on the Web may be exploited. DBpedia
presents several language speciﬁc chapters3 extracted from
the language speciﬁc Wikipedia chapters, where informa-
tion is presented in a structured format. DBpedia chap-
ters, well connected through Wikipedia instance interlink-
ing, can contain different information from one language to
another. In particular, language speciﬁc chapters can pro-
vide i) more details about certain topics, ii) ﬁll informa-
tion gaps (provide information missed in the other DBpedia
chapters), or iii) conceptualize certain relations according
to a speciﬁc cultural viewpoint (Rinser et al., 2012). If on
the one side relying on information contained in language
speciﬁc DBpedia chapters in Natural Language Processing
(NLP) interfaces and applications (e.g., NL question an-
swering systems over Linked Data) would bring promising
improvements on systems coverage, on the other side they
face the following problems: i) different results can be ob-
tained for the same query (e.g., English and French DBpe-
dia chapters provide a different date of birth of Louis IX of

1http://www.w3.org/RDF/
2http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-sparql-query/
3http://wiki.dbpedia.org/
Internationalization/Chapters

France), and ii) the combination of these query results may
lead to inconsistent information sets about the same topic.
To better understand the problem, let us consider for in-
stance a question answering system that takes as input NL
questions and queries two (or more) language speciﬁc chap-
ters of DBpedia for answer retrieval (e.g. QAKiS4 (Cabrio
et al., 2013a)). Ideally, we would expect that each DBpedia
endpoint returns its own answer and all these answers are
identical. However, this is not always the case, and three
possible situations arise, illustrated in Figure 1 (Cojan et
al., 2013): i) the same result is provided from both chapters
(i.e., both datasets contain the same value for the same rela-
tion), ii) two different results are provided (i.e., the datasets
contain different values for the same relation), iii) the re-
sult is provided from one chapter only (only one dataset
provides the value for the queried relation). Considering
the two DBpedia biggest chapters, i.e. English and French
ones, on the total of all the properties used in the two chap-
ters, 11.4% of the properties have the same value in the two
chapters (∼343,000), 5.8% have different values in the two
chapters (∼175,000), 67.3% have a value only in the En-
glish chapter (∼2,022,500), and 15.5% has a value only in
the French chapter (∼460,500). If the results are the same,
the answer to be returned to the user is precisely this result
set, but if the results are different then a speciﬁc manage-
ment of the query result has to be done before returning the
answer to the user.
While several initiatives are proposed to push DBpedia con-
tributors into extending the property mapping to DBpedia
common ontology, in this paper we focus on case (ii), and
we address the following research question:

• How to detect the inconsistencies arising from merg-
ing information from DBpedia language speciﬁc chap-
ters?

In particular, the research question breaks down into the

4http://qakis.org/qakis2/

1443

Figure 1: Possible outcomes of the values comparison among DBpedia language speciﬁc chapters.

following sub-questions:

1. Which kind of semantic relations can be established
to reconcile information provided by language speciﬁc
DBpedia chapters to obtain a consistent results set?

2. How to compute in an automated way consistent re-

sults sets starting from the identiﬁed relations?

To answer the research questions, we propose a data-driven
approach to identify and classify the semantic relations
holding among the possible different answers obtained for
a certain query on DBpedia language speciﬁc chapters. We
consider 17 DBpedia ontology properties, and we collect
the data from the different multilingual chapters of DBpe-
dia concerning such properties. We further identify which
kind of relations hold between the query results items. In
order to provide a machine-readable version of our dataset,
we introduce the LingRel ontology, a lightweight vocabu-
lary composed of properties only, where the relations we
identiﬁed are formally represented.
Starting from the identiﬁed semantic relations between two
pieces of information, we further classify them as posi-
tive or negative, and we exploit bipolar abstract argumen-
tation (Dung, 1995; Cayrol and Lagasquie-Schiex, 2011)
to represent the result set as a unique graph, such that ar-
gumentation semantics can be adopted to detect the (pos-
sible multiple) consistent sets of elements of the query re-
sult. Only this consistent set of information items has to be
returned to the user. Again, in order to provide such argu-
mentation graphs in a machine-readable format, we adopt
the extended SIOC Argumentation vocabulary5 proposed
by Cabrio et al. (2013c) where two kinds of relations among
the nodes of the graph hold, i.e., a support relation and an
attack relation.
The remainder of the paper is as follows. We ﬁrst present
our classiﬁcation of the relations holding between the val-
ues we retrieved from the results set over different lan-
guage speciﬁc DBpedia chapters (Section 2.), and second
we adopt argumentation theory to detect the inconsisten-
cies arising in the results set of the query (Section 3.). The
feasibility study of our data-driven approach is detailed in
Section 4. Section 5. compares the proposed approach with
other approaches adopting argumentation theory for on-
tologies alignment and communities management. Finally,
some conclusions are drawn.

Inconsistencies classiﬁcation

The ﬁrst step of our approach consists in identifying which
kind of semantic relation holds among the different values
obtained by querying a set of language speciﬁc DBpedia
chapters with a certain query. More precisely, we want
to detect the linguistic phenomena holding among the in-
consistent values obtained querying two DBpedia language
speciﬁc chapters at a time, given a certain subject and a
certain ontological property.
In the following, we propose our classiﬁcation of the lin-
guistic phenomena we detected, deﬁned referring to widely
accepted linguistic categories in the literature. We identify
the following positive relations between values (mainly dis-
course and lexical semantics relations):

a) identity, i.e.

same value but in different languages

(missing SameAs link in DBpedia)
E.g., Dairy product vs Produits laitiers
(property:
product); Yevgeny Kaspersky vs
Eugene Kaspersky (property: owner)

b) acronym, i.e. initial components in a phrase or a word
E.g., PSDB vs Partito della Social Demo-
crazia Brasiliana (property:
leaderParty);
RFID
Radio-frequency identification
(property: product)

vs

c) disambiguated entity, i.e. one value contains in the

name the class to which the entity belongs
E.g.,
Michael Lewis (Author) vs Michael
Lewis (property: author); David Williams (oil
baron) vs David Williams (property: fundedBy)

d) identity:stage name, i.e. pen/stage names pointing to

the same entity
E.g., Lemony Snicket vs Daniel Handler (prop-
erty:
author); The Wachowskis vs Andy et
Larry Wachowski (property: director)

e) coreference, i.e. an expression referring to another
expression describing the same thing (in particular,
non normalized expressions)
E.g.,
William S.
Burroughs (property: author); Arup vs Arup
Associates (property: architect)

William Burroughs

vs

f) renaming, i.e. reformulation of the same entity name

in time
E.g., Charleville (Ardennes), old name of

1444

Charleville-M´ezi`eres (property: birthPlace);
Edo, old name of Tokyo (property: birthPlace)

g) metonymy, i.e. a thing/concept not called by its own
name, but by the name of something intimately asso-
ciated with that thing/concept
E.g., Joseph Hanna vs Hanna-Barbera (property:
author); Hamburg vs FC St.
Pauli (property:
owner)

h) geo-speciﬁcation,

i.e.

ontological geographical

knowledge
E.g., Castelnau-Barbarens vs France (property:
birthPlace); Queensland vs Australia (prop-
erty: spokenIn)

i) meronymy, i.e. a constituent part of, or a member of

something
E.g., Justicialist Party is a part of Front for
Victory (property: leaderParty); Bob Marley
was a part of The Wailers (property: fundedBy)

j) hyponymy, i.e. relation between a speciﬁc word and a
general word when the former is included within the
latter
E.g., alluminio vs metal (property: product);
sport car vs autovettura (property: product)

Moreover, we identify the following negative relations (i.e.,
values mismatches):

k) text mismatch, i.e. unrelated entity/thing

E.g., Palermo vs Modene (property:
owner
); Yves Allegret vs Marc Allegret (property:
director)

l) date mismatch , i.e. different date for the same event

1215-04-25 vs 1214-04-25 (property:
E.g.,
birthDate); 1397-08-10 vs 1397-08-16 (prop-
erty: birthDate)

m) numerical mismatch, i.e. different numberical values
E.g., 1.91 vs 1.8 (property: height); 1000 vs 1200
(property: numberOfStudents)

3. Mapping Inconsistencies to Bipolar

Argumentation Graphs

To address the problem of inconsistencies detection and
reconciliation of information coming from different lan-
guage speciﬁc DBpedia chapters, the second step of our
approach consists in the transformation of the detected lin-
guistic phenomena into argumentation-based relations. In
particular, we map positive relations (categories a to j) and
negative relations (k to m) respectively with the support
and conﬂict relations in bipolar argumentation theory.
An abstract argumentation framework (AAF) (Dung, 1995)
aims at representing conﬂicts among elements called argu-
ments. An argumentation framework is based on a binary
attack relation among arguments, whose role is determined
only by their relation with the other arguments.

Deﬁnition 1 An abstract argumentation framework (AAF)
is a tuple (cid:104)A, →(cid:105) where A is a ﬁnite set of arguments and
→ is a binary attack relation on A.

An AF encodes, through the conﬂict (i.e., attack) relation,
the existing conﬂicts within a set of arguments. It is then in-
teresting to identify the conﬂict outcomes, which, roughly
speaking, means determining which arguments should be
accepted (“they survive the conﬂict”) and which arguments
should be rejected, according to some reasonable criterion.
(Dung, 1995) presents several acceptability semantics that
produce zero, one, or several consistent sets of accepted
arguments. The set of accepted arguments of an argumen-
tation framework consists of a set of arguments that does
not contain an argument conﬂicting with another argument
in the set. This set is called a conﬂict free set of arguments.
Following from this notion, an admissible set of arguments
is required to be both internally coherent (conﬂict-free) and
able to defend its elements. In our framework, we adopt
admissibility based semantics. Roughly, an argument is ac-
cepted if all the arguments attacking it are rejected, and it
is rejected if there is at least an argument attacking it which
is accepted. The (possibly multiple) sets of accepted ar-
guments computed using one of the acceptability seman-
tics are called extensions, and the addition of another ar-
gument from outside the set will make the set inconsistent.
For more details about acceptability semantics, see (Dung,
1995). An example of abstract argumentation framework is
visualized in Figure 2.a.
Since we represent in the argumentation graph also positive
relations among the arguments, we adopt bipolar argumen-
tation theory (Cayrol and Lagasquie-Schiex, 2011) where
in addition to the conﬂict relation, we have a binary sup-
port relation among arguments.

Deﬁnition 2 A bipolar argumentation framework is a tu-
ple (cid:104)A, →, (cid:57)(cid:57)(cid:75)(cid:105) where A is a ﬁnite set of arguments, →⊆
A × A, and (cid:57)(cid:57)(cid:75) is a binary relation called support deﬁned
on A × A.

An example of bipolar argumentation framework is visu-
alized in Figure 2.b where the dotted edge represents the
support relation.

Figure 2: Example of (a) an abstract argumentation frame-
work, and (b) a bipolar argumentation framework.

Bipolar argumentation has been exploited by (Cabrio et al.,
2013b) to detect inconsistencies among the answers pro-
vided by a QA system over linked data. However, in this
work only the subsumption and the identity relations were
considered as positive relations among the arguments, and
no distinction was provided w.r.t. the different kinds of con-
ﬂicts.
Among the positive relations, some of them (e.g., identity,
coreference) are bidirectional which means that they are
translated in the AAF as a bidirectional support relation.
Some others are directional (e.g., meronymy, hyponymy)

and we map them as a directional support relation in the ar-
gumentation graph. On the contrary, all mismatches are al-
ways bidirectional conﬂicts among the arguments. Figure 3
shows how the examples of date mismatch and meronymy
are represented as bipolar argumentation graphs.
In the
ﬁrst case, given that the two arguments attack each other,
they are evaluated as undecided (e.g., using preferred se-
mantics). The idea is that either we accept one of them
rejecting the other, or we evaluate them both as undecided
as they contradict each other. In the second case, the direc-
tional support relation from the meronymy relation is from
the more precise argument Justicialist Party to
the more general one Front for Victory. Both the
arguments are accepted, as there are no conﬂicts between
them.

Figure 3: Example of (a) date mismatch, and (b) meronymy.

The reader may argue that argumentation theory is too
much powerful (i.e., too much complicated) for the task of
detecting an inconsistency, as in the case of date mismatch.
For instance, just looking at the kind of properties involved,
i.e., functional properties like birthDate, would lead to
the identiﬁcation of an inconsistency. However, it must be
noticed that when the query is raised against 10 or more
DBpedia chapters, then the result is a bipolar argumentation
graph where there is a node for each result item provided
by each chapter. The idea of using argumentation is that in
this way we are able to solve the inconsistency and know
what is the right result. Consider for instance, a case where
we query 5 different DBpedia multilingual chapters: two
of them return the values for birthDate in Figure 3, and
the remaining three return the value 1215-04-25. These
values will support each others, leading to the ﬁnal choice
of the result 1215-04-25, as the only consistent result to
be proposed to the user.

4. Feasibility study
In the following, we describe the ongoing work of creation
of a dataset of values extracted from DBpedia language spe-
ciﬁc chapters, that we annotate with the semantic relations
holding among pairs of values, so that to highlight possible
inconsistencies. More speciﬁcally, in Section 4.1. we detail
how we extracted the DBpedia triples to be annotated with
the linguistic categories listed in Section 2. In Section 4.2.,
we present the data translation and the LingRel vocabulary
we designed to describe the data. In Section 4.3. we build
the argumentation graphs by adopting the SIOC-Argumen-
tation extended ontology.

4.1. Dataset annotation
To assess the feasibility of the proposed approach to build a
dataset of possibly inconsistent information, we randomly
selected a sample of 17 DBpedia ontology properties (Ta-
ble 2., column ontology properties). We then query En-
glish, French and Italian DBpedia chapters in such a way
to extract a set of RDF triples (subject, property, object)
where the subject and the property are the same, but with
a different object or datatype value. More speciﬁcally, for
each property of the DBpedia ontology we extract 25 triples
providing possibly inconsistent values (13 for the property
spokenIn, 16 for property nationality, and 21 for
the property architect) in at least two DBpedia chap-
ters (e.g. English vs French chapter, or English vs Italian
chapter). We narrow the scope of our search to the in-
stances (subjects) that have only one value for the property
under observation.6 An annotator with skills in linguistics
annotated then the relations among the couples of extracted
values, applying the category labels proposed in Section 2.
Examples 1 and 2 show the XML annotation format of the
pairs in the dataset. The information conveyed by Exam-
ple 1 is that there exists a relation of metonymy between
the entities Joseph Barbera and Hanna-Barbera, indicated
as authors of the show The Ruff & Reddy Show, respec-
tively from the English and the Italian DBpedia chapters.
The information conveyed by Example 2 is that there exists

6The underlying reason is that in this work we focus on possi-
bly inconsistent information, and not on incomplete lists of values.

a relation of geo-speciﬁcation between the entities Londra
(i.e. London) and Camden Town, indicated as bithPlace
of the English actor Anthony Head, respectively from the
English and the Italian DBpedia chapters.
For each pair in the dataset (each containing therefore a
triple with a certain subject and a certain property, and for
which the object assumes different values in the language
speciﬁc DBpedia chapters), the subject of the triple is ex-
pressed as the value of the attribute dbpediasubj, the prop-
erty as the value of the attribute dpediaontologyproperty.
The different values of the object are contained into the el-
ements value1 and value2, respectively. For each value, the
DBpedia chapter of provenance is reported (attribute dbpe-
diachapter). The relation holding between the two values
is reported as attribute of the element pair (i.e. relation).

Example 1

<pair id="9" relation="METONYMY"
dpediaontologyproperty="author"
dbpediasubj="The_Ruff_&_Reddy_Show">
<value1 dbpediachapter="EN">
Joseph_Barbera
</value1>
<value2 dbpediachapter="IT">
Hanna-Barbera
</value2>

</pair>

Example 2

<pair id="55" relation="GEO-SPECIFICATION"
dpediaontologyproperty="birthPlace"
dbpediasubj="Anthony_Head">

<value1 dbpediachapter="IT">
Londra
</value1>
<value2 dbpediachapter="EN">
Camden_Town
</value2>

</pair>

To assess the validity of the annotation task, we calcu-
late the inter-annotator agreement. Another annotator with
skills in linguistics has therefore independently annotated
a sample of 30 pairs of the data set. While the percentage
of agreement between the two annotators is 72%, Fixed-
marginal kappa is 0.69. Overall, we consider this value
high enough to demonstrate the stability of the categories of
the proposed set of semantic relations, thus validating their
classiﬁcation model. Most of the disagreements between
annotators were due to misunderstandings in the deﬁnition
of the categories identity and coreference, whose distinction
can be not very straightforward at ﬁrst sight.
Table 2. reports on the results of this pilot annotation, as
obtained after the reconciliation phase. The resource is cur-
rently composed of 400 annotated pairs of values, where the
actual distribution of linguistic phenomena holding among
possibly inconsistent values in DBpedia chapters emerges.
A number of remarks can be made on the data presented in
Table 2. First of all, a distinction exists between datatype
properties (properties for which the value is a data literal)
and object properties (properties for which the value is an

individual). For the former properties (e.g. birthDate,
numberOfStudents), a different value in the range iden-
tiﬁes always an inconsistent result sets. Possible rules could
then be chosen to reconcile such information when possi-
ble, for instance deﬁning a tolerance value (applicable to
properties such as numberOfStudents, but not applicable to
functional properties like birthDate).
For object properties, we can notice recurrent types of re-
lations occurring between possibly inconsistent values, de-
pending on the class of the range of the property. For in-
stance, for properties as birthDate and sourceCountry,
whose range is of class place (or of semantically similar
classes as country or PopulatedPlace), the most recurrent
cause of values mismatch is the fact that one DBpedia chap-
ter contains a more ﬁne-grained location with respect to the
other chapter (that we call geo-speciﬁcation), as showed
for instance in Example 2. The classes of such possibly
inconsistent values should therefore be taken into consid-
eration when possible, so that to ﬁnd an adequate knowl-
edge base supporting a system in reconciling such infor-
mation (e.g. GeoNames7 for geographical entities). For
more “standard” lexical semantics relations (as hyponymy,
or meronymy) lexical databases such as WordNet (and its
multilingual variants EuroWordNet or MultiWordNet) can
contribute to the fulﬁllment of this purpose. The number
of pairs labeled with the relation identity highlights the fact
that the SameAs links between the same instance in differ-
ent DBpedia chapters are often missing, and that an effort is
required by the DBpedia community to ﬁll this gap. Finally,
as expected, relations as renaming and identity:stage
name are less frequent than the others in the data, but we
consider it important to include them in our classiﬁcation,
since they capture two relations among possibly inconsis-
tent values that were not captured by the other relations.
Note that the list of semantic relations we propose in this
work is not exhaustive, and reﬂects the types of relations
we detected in the sample of DBpedia triples we analyzed.

4.2. LingRel vocabulary
In order to describe the data using the semantic prop-
erties we highlighted in Section 2., we designed a new
lightweight vocabulary called LingRel8. In particular, Lin-
gRel models the ten positive semantic relations we identi-
ﬁed on the data. We need to design our own ontology since
we could not ﬁnd another ontology actually modeling the
properties we required. However, in the light of the Web
of Data philosophy, the properties of LingRel have been
aligned with other vocabularies like SKOS, Ontology Pat-
terns, when possible. The properties and their alignment
are presented below (XML/RDF format).

Negative relations, i.e., text mismatch, date mismatch, and
numerical mismatch, are more subtle and cannot be rep-
resented in the same way in the vocabulary. These rela-
tions have been detected in the data, and they characterize
the possible kinds of inconsistencies. These inconsistencies
arise due to functional properties that present more than one
value, i.e., for birth dates, height, etc. In order to include
also such data in the machine-readable dataset we create
using LingRel, we introduce in the vocabulary also a “neg-
ative” relation called mismatch, that we use to annotated
the data when one of the possible mismatches we identiﬁed
arises.

We then build the argumentation graphs by adopting
the SIOC-Argumentation extended ontology9 provided
in (Cabrio et al., 2013d). The main classes of the vocab-

We generated a dataset10 in the RDF format using such ex-
tension of the SIOC Argumentation vocabulary such that

the information items we retrieved from the different chap-
ters are linked by a support or a conﬂict relation (expressed
through the two properties deﬁned in the ontology). The
ten positive relations of LingRel are mapped with the sup-
port relation in SIOC-Argumentation, and the mismatch re-
lation with the challenges (i.e., attack) relation in SIOC-
Argumentation. The ﬁnal aim of such pilot study is that
such dataset can be queried using SPARQL to discover fur-
ther insightful information. An example of data extracted
from the RDF dataset annotated with the extended SIOC
Argumentation vocabulary is provided below, where the se-
mantic relation stage name is translated into a support rela-
tion in the argumentation perspective.

5. Related Work
Several works address alignment agreement based on ar-
gumentation theory. More precisely, Laera et al. (Laera
et al., 2007) address alignment agreement relying on ar-
gumentation to deal with the arguments which attack or
support the candidate correspondences among ontologies.
Doran et al. (Doran et al., 2009) propose a methodology
to identify subparts of ontologies which are evaluated as
sufﬁcient for reaching an agreement, before the argumen-
tation step takes place, and dos Santos and Euzenat (dos
Santos and Euzenat, 2010) present a model for detecting
inconsistencies in the selected sets of correspondences re-
lating ontologies. In particular, the model detects logical
and argumentation inconsistency to avoid inconsistencies
in the agreed alignment. The framework we propose has
common points with this line of works, i.e., the use of ar-
gumentation theory to select a consistent set of information
items, but the scenario in which the two approaches are ex-
ploited is different and this leads to a different addressed
issues and proposed solutions. Another framework com-
bining argumentation theory and NLP in the Semantic Web
has been proposed by Cabrio et al. (Cabrio et al., 2013c).
The authors propose an automatic framework to support the
management of argumentative discussions in wiki-like plat-
forms. In particular, a natural language module is proposed
to detect the arguments in natural language returning the
relations among them, and argumentation theory provides
the overall view of the argumentative discussion highlight-
ing the accepted arguments. The arguments and their rela-
tions are then translated in RDF using the SIOC Argumen-
tation vocabulary to be queried using SPARQL in order to
retrieve additional information. In this paper, the arguments
are represented by the results of a query over the multilin-
gual chapters of DBpedia, and we use the semantic rela-
tions among the information items to provide the relations
among the arguments, and then compute the accepted ones.

6. Conclusions and perspectives
The pilot study we have described is a ﬁrst step toward
the creation of a large-scale annotated dataset of DBpedia

language speciﬁc chapters inconsistencies. We have ex-
tracted 400 pairs of values for the 17 DBpedia ontology
relations we selected, and we identiﬁed ten positive rela-
tions holding between such values extracted from the mul-
tilingual chapters. Finally, we mapped the relations with
the support and attack relations in argumentation, such that
argumentation graphs are built to further support incon-
sistencies detection and discovering information thanks to
the machine-readable argumentation graphs. Such resource
can be exploited both to train and to evaluate NLP appli-
cations querying linked data in detecting the semantic re-
lations among the extracted values, to output consistent in-
formation sets (lexical semantics resources can for instance
be integrated into such systems to turn the inconsistencies
belonging to categories a to j into support relations). More-
over, pointing out mismatches (categories k to m) in the
queried data improves the systems reliability.
As for future work, we plan to exploit the outcomes of the
study presented here to improve our automatic framework
to detect the inconsistencies which may arise into a set of
answers provided by a QA system over linked data. In our
ﬁrst attempt (Cabrio et al., 2013b), only the subsumption
and the identity relations were considered as positive rela-
tions among the arguments, and no distinction was provided
w.r.t.
the different kinds of conﬂicts. We plan therefore
to investigate how to deal with more ﬁne-grained relations
among possibly inconsistent answers, and to propose ad-
hoc strategies to reconcile such information.
