Transformer, a lightweight alternative by care-
ful sparsiﬁcation. To reduce model complex-
ity, we replace the fully-connected structure
with a star-shaped topology, in which every
two non-adjacent nodes are connected through
a shared relay node. Thus, complexity is
reduced from quadratic to linear, while pre-
serving capacity to capture both local compo-
sition and long-range dependency. The ex-
periments on four tasks (22 datasets) show
that Star-Transformer achieved signiﬁcant im-

Introduction

the fully-connected attention-based
Recently,
models, like Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017),
become popular in natural language processing
(NLP) applications, notably machine translation
(Vaswani et al., 2017) and language modeling
(Radford et al., 2018). Some recent work also
suggest that Transformer can be an alternative
to recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and convo-
lutional neural networks (CNNs) in many NLP
tasks, such as GPT (Radford et al., 2018), BERT
(Devlin et al., 2018), Transformer-XL (Dai et al.,
2019) and Universal Transformer (Dehghani et al.,
2018).

More speciﬁcally, there are two limitations of
the Transformer. First, the computation and mem-

ory overhead of the Transformer are quadratic to
a sequence length. This is especially problematic
with long sentences. Transformer-XL (Dai et al.,
2019) provides a solution which achieves the ac-
celeration and performance improvement, but it
is speciﬁcally designed for the language model-
ing task. Second, studies indicate that pre-training
on large corpus brings signiﬁcant improvement for
Transformer (Radford et al., 2018; Devlin et al.,
2018). Transformer failed on many tasks, how-
ever, if it is not pre-trained and when training data
is limited.

A key obervation is that Transformer is weakly
bounded by prior knowledge. For example, the
local compositionality is already a robust induc-
tive bias for modeling the text sequence. The
Transformer learns this bias from scratch, along
with non-local compositionality, thereby increas-
ing the learning cost. The key insight is then
whether leveraging strong prior knowledge can
help to “lighten up” the architecture.

To address the above limitation, we pro-

posed a new lightweight model named “Star-
Transformer”. The core idea is to sparsify the
architecture by moving the fully-connected topol-
ogy into a star-shaped structure. Fig-1 gives an
overview. Star-Transformer has two kinds of con-
nections. The radical connections preserve the
non-local communication and remove the redun-
dancy in fully-connected network. The ring con-
nections embody the local-compositionality prior,
which has the same role as in CNNs/RNNs. The
direct outcome of our design is the improvement
of both efﬁciency and learning cost: the compu-
tation cost is reduced from quadratic to linear as a
function of input sequence length. An inherent ad-
vantage is that the ring connections can effectively
reduce the burden of the unbias learning of local
and non-local compositionality and improve the
generalization ability of the model. What remains
to be tested is whether one shared relay node is
capable of capturing the long-range dependencies.
We evaluate the Star-Transformer on three NLP
tasks including Text Classiﬁcation, Natural Lan-
guage Inference, and Sequence Labelling. Experi-
mental results show that Star-Transformer outper-
forms the standard Transformer consistently and
has less computation complexity. An additional
analysis on a simulation task indicates that Star-
Transformer preserve the ability to handle with
long-range dependencies which is a crucial feature
of the standard Transformer.

In this paper, we claim three contributions as the

following:

• Compared to the standard Transformer, Star-
Transformer has a lightweight structure but
with an approximate ability to model the
long-range dependencies.
It reduces the
number of connections from n2 to 2n, where
n is the sequence length.

• The Star-Transformer divides the labor of se-
mantic compositions between the radical and
the ring connections. The radical connections
focus on the non-local compositions and the
ring connections focus on the local composi-
tion. Therefore, Star-Transformer works for
modestly sized datasets and does not rely on
heavy pre-training.

• We design a simulation task “Masked Sum-
mation” to probe the ability dealing with

we verify that both Transformer and Star-
Transformer are good at handling long-range
dependencies compared to the LSTM and
BiLSTM.

2 Related Work

Recently, neural networks have proved very suc-
cessful in learning text representation and have
achieved state-of-the-art results in many different
tasks.

Modelling Local Compositionality A popular
approach is to represent each word as a low-
dimensional vector and then learn the local seman-
tic composition functions over the given sentence
structures. For example, Kim (2014); Kalchbren-
ner et al. (2014) used CNNs to capture the seman-
tic representation of sentences, whereas Cho et al.
(2014) used RNNs.

These methods are biased for learning local
compositional functions and are hard to capture
the long-term dependencies in a text sequence. In
order to augment the ability to model the non-
local compositionality, a class of improved meth-
ods utilizes various self-attention mechanisms to
aggregate the weighted information of each word,
which can be used to get sentence-level represen-
tations for classiﬁcation tasks (Yang et al., 2016;
Lin et al., 2017; Shen et al., 2018a). Another class
of improved methods augments neural networks
with a re-reading ability or global state while pro-
cessing each word (Cheng et al., 2016; Zhang
et al., 2018).

Modelling Non-Local Compositionality There
are two kinds of methods to model the non-local
semantic compositions in a text sequence directly.
One class of models incorporate syntactic tree
into the network structure for learning sentence
representations (Tai et al., 2015; Zhu et al., 2015).
Another type of models learns the dependencies
between words based entirely on self-attention
without any recurrent or convolutional layers, such
as Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017), which
has achieved state-of-the-art results on a machine
translation task. The success of Transformer has
raised a large body of follow-up work. Therefore,
some Transformer variations are also proposed,
such as GPT (Radford et al., 2018), BERT (Devlin
et al., 2018), Transformer-XL (Dai et al., 2019) ,
Universal Transformer (Dehghani et al., 2018) and
CN3 (Liu et al., 2018a).

However,

those Transformer-based methods
usually require a large training corpus. When ap-
plying them on modestly sized datasets, we need
the help of semi-supervised learning and unsu-
pervised pretraining techniques (Radford et al.,
2018).

Graph Neural Networks Star-Transformer is
also inspired by the recent graph networks (Gilmer
et al., 2017; Kipf and Welling, 2016; Battaglia
et al., 2018; Liu et al., 2018b), in which the in-
formation fusion progresses via message-passing
across the whole graph.

The graph structure of the Star-Transformer is
star-shaped by introducing a virtual relay node.
The radical and ring connections give a better bal-
ance between the local and non-local composition-
ality. Compared to the previous augmented mod-
els (Yang et al., 2016; Lin et al., 2017; Shen et al.,
2018a; Cheng et al., 2016; Zhang et al., 2018), the
implementation of Star-Transform is purely based
on the attention mechanism similar to the standard
Transformer, which is simpler and well suited for
parallel computation.

Due to its better parallel capacity and lower
complexity,
the Star-Transformer is faster than
RNNs or Transformer, especially on modeling
long sequences.

3 Model

3.1 Architecture

The Star-Transformer consists of one relay node
and n satellite nodes. The state of i-th satellite
node represents the features of the i-th token in a
text sequence. The relay node acts as a virtual hub
to gather and scatter information from and to all
the satellite nodes.

Star-Transformer has a star-shaped structure,
with two kinds of connections in the: the radical
connections and the ring connections.

Radical Connections For a network of n satel-
lite nodes, there are n radical connections. Each
connection links a satellite node to the shared re-
lay node. With the radical connections, every two
non-adjacent satellite nodes are two-hop neigh-
bors and can receive non-local information with
a two-step update.

to capture the relationship of local compositions.
The ﬁrst and last nodes are also connected. Thus,
all these local connections constitute a ring-shaped
structure. Note that the ring connections allow
each satellite node to gather information from its
neighbors and plays the same role to CNNs or
bidirectional RNNs.

With the radical and ring connections, Star-
Transformer can capture both the non-local and lo-
cal compositions simultaneously. Different from
the standard Transformer, we make a division of
labor, where the radical connections capture non-
local compositions, whereas the ring connections
attend to local compositions.

3.2

Implementation

The implementation of the Star-Transformer is
very similar to the standard Transformer, in which
the information exchange is based on the attention
mechanism (Vaswani et al., 2017).

Multi-head Attention Just as in the standard
Transformer, we use the scaled dot-product atten-
tion (Vaswani et al., 2017). Given a sequence of
vectors H ∈ Rn×d, we can use a query vector
q ∈ R1×d to soft select the relevant information
with attention.

Att(q, K, V) = softmax(

)V,

where K = HWK, V = HWV , and WK, WV
are learnable parameters.

To gather more useful information from H, sim-
ilar to multi-channels in CNNs, we can use multi-
head attention with k heads.

Update Let st ∈ R1×d and Ht ∈ Rn×d de-
note the states for the relay node and all the n
satellite nodes at step t. When using the Star-
Transformer to encode a text sequence of length
n, we start from its embedding E = [e1; · · · ; en],
where ei ∈ R1×d is the embedding of the i-th to-
ken.

We initialize the state with H0 = E and s0 =

is a se-
quence, we bake such prior as an inductive bias.

average(E).

The update of the Star-Transformer at step t can
be divided into two alternative phases: (1) the up-
date of the satellite nodes and (2) the update of the
relay node.

At the ﬁrst phase, the state of each satellite node
hi are updated from its adjacent nodes, includ-
ing the neighbor nodes hi−1, hi+1 in the sequence,
the relay node st, its previous state, and its corre-
sponding token embedding.

where Ct
i denotes the context information for the
i-th satellite node. Thus, the update of each satel-
lite node is similar to the recurrent network, except
that the update fashion is based on attention mech-
anism. After the information exchange, a layer
normalization operation (Ba et al., 2016) is used.

i = LayerNorm(ReLU(ht
ht

i)), i ∈ [1, n].

(6)

At the second phase, the relay node st summa-
rizes the information of all the satellite nodes and
its previous state.

st = MultiAtt(st−1, [st−1; Ht]),
st = LayerNorm(ReLU(st)).

(7)

(8)

By alternatively updating update the satellite
and relay nodes, the Star-Transformer ﬁnally cap-
tures all the local and non-local compositions for
an input text sequence.

Position Embeddings To incorporate the se-
quence information, we also add the learnable po-
sition embeddings, which are concatenated with
the token embeddings and shared across all the
time steps.

The overall update algorithm of

the Star-

Transformer is shown in the Alg-1.

3.3 Output
After T rounds of update, the ﬁnal states of HT
and sT can be used for various tasks such as se-
quence labeling and classiﬁcation. For different
tasks, we feed them to different task-speciﬁc mod-
ules. For classiﬁcation, we generate the ﬁx-length
sentence-level vector representation by applying a
max-pooling across the ﬁnal layer and mixing it
with sT , this vector is fed into a Multiple Layer
Perceptron (MLP) classiﬁer. For the sequence la-
beling task, the HT provides features correspond-
ing to all the input tokens.

4 Comparison to the standard

Transformer

Since our goal
is making the Transformer
lightweight and easy to train with modestly sized
dataset, we have removed many connections com-
pared with the standard Transformer (see Fig-1).
If the sequence length is n and the dimension
of hidden states is d, the computation complex-
ity of one layer in the standard Transformer is
O(n2d). The Star-Transformer has two phases,
the update of ring connections costs O(5nd) (the
constant 5 comes from the size of context infor-
mation C), and the update of radical connections
costs O(nd), so the total cost of one layer in the
Star-Transformer is O(6nd).

In theory, Star-Transformer can cover all the
possible relationships in the standard Transformer.
For example, any relationship hi → hj in the
standard Transformer can be simulated by hi →
s → hj. The experiment on the simulation task in
Sec-5.1 provides some evidence to show the vir-
tual node s could handle long-range dependencies.
Following this aspect, we can give a rough anal-
ysis of the path length of dependencies in these
models. As discussed in the Transformer paper
(Vaswani et al., 2017), the maximum dependency
path length of RNN and Transformer are O(n),
O(1), respectively. Star-Transformer can pass the
message from one node to another node via the
relay node so that the maximum dependency path
length is also O(1), with a constat two comparing
to Transformer.

Compare with the standard Transformer, all po-
sitions are processed in parallel, pair-wise connec-
tions are replaced with a “gather and dispatch”
mechanism. As a result, we accelerate the Trans-

times on real tasks. The model also preserves the
ability to handle long input sequences. Besides
the acceleration,
the Star-Transformer achieves
signiﬁcant improvement on some modestly sized
datasets.

5 Experiments

We evaluate Star-Transformer on one simulation
task to probe its behavior when challenged with
long-range dependency problem, and three real
tasks (Text Classiﬁcation, Natural Language Infer-
ence, and Sequence Labelling). All experiments
are ran on an NVIDIA Titan X GPU. Datasets used
in this paper are listed in the Tab-1. We use the
Adam (Kingma and Ba, 2014) as our optimizer.
On the real task, we set the embedding size to
300 and initialized with GloVe (Pennington et al.,
2014). And the symbol “Ours + Char” means an
additional character-level pre-trained embedding
JMT (Hashimoto et al., 2017) is used. There-
fore, the total size of embedding should be 400
which as a result of the concatenation of GloVe
and JMT. We also ﬁx the embedding layer of the
Star-Transformer in all experiments.

Since semi- or unsupervised model is also a fea-
sible solution to improve the model in a parallel
direction, such as the ELMo (Peters et al., 2018)
and BERT (Devlin et al., 2018), we exclude these
models in the comparison and focus on the rele-
vant architectures.

5.1 Masked Summation

In this section, we introduce a simulation task on
the synthetic data to probe the efﬁciency and non-
local/long-range dependencies of LSTM, Trans-
former, and the Star-Transformer. As mentioned
the maximum path
in (Vaswani et al., 2017),
length of long-range dependencies of LSTM and
Transformer are O(n) and O(1), where n is the
sequence length. The maximum dependency path
length of Star-Transformer is O(2) via the relay
node. To validate the ability to deal with long-
range dependencies, we design a simulation task
named “Masked Summation”. The input of this
task is a matrix X ∈ Rn×d, it has n columns
and each column has d elements. The ﬁrst di-
mension indicates the mask value Xi0 ∈ {0, 1},
0 means the column is ignored in summation. The
rest d − 1 elements are real numbers in drawn uni-
formly from the range [0, 1). The target is a d − 1
dimensional vector which equals the summation
of all the columns with the mask value 1. There is
an implicit variable k to control the number of 1
in the input. Note that a simple baseline is always
guessing the value k/2.

The evaluation metric is the Mean Square
Error
(MSE), and the generated dataset has
(10k/10k/10k) samples in (train/dev/test) sets. The
Fig-2 show a case of the masked summation task.
The mask summation task asks the model to
recognize the mask value and gather columns in
different positions. When the sequence length
n is signiﬁcantly higher than the number of the
columns k, the model will face the long-range de-
pendencies problem. The Fig-3a shows the per-

5.2 Text Classiﬁcation

Text classiﬁcation is a basic NLP task, and we se-
lect two datasets to observe the performance of
our model in different conditions, Stanford Senti-
ment Treebank(SST) dataset (Socher et al., 2013)
and MTL-16 (Liu et al., 2017) consists of 16 small
datasets on various domains. We truncate the se-
quence which its length higher than 256 to ensure
the standard Transformer can run on a single GPU
card.

For classiﬁcation tasks, we use the state of the
relay node sT plus the feature of max pooling on
satellite nodes max(HT ) as the ﬁnal representa-
tion and feed it into the softmax classiﬁer. The
description of hyper-parameters is listed in Tab-1
and Appendix.

Results on SST and MTL-16 datasets are listed
in Tab-2,3, respectively. On the SST, the Star-
Transformer achieves 2.5 points improvement
against the standard Transformer and beat the most
models.

Also, on the MTL-16,

the Star-Transformer
outperform the standard Transformer in all 16
datasets, the improvement of the average accu-
racy is 4.2. The Star-Transformer also gets bet-
ter results compared with existing works. As
we mentioned in the introduction, the standard
Transformer requires large training set
to re-
veal its power. Our experiments show the Star-

(a) MSE loss on the masked summation when
n = 200, k = 10, d = 10. The k/2 line means
the MSE loss when the model always guess the ex-
ception value k/2.

formance curves of models on various lengths.
Although the task is easy,
the performance of
LSTM and BiLSTM dropped quickly when the se-
quence length increased. However, both Trans-
former and Star-Transformer performed consis-
tently on various lengths. The result indicates the
Star-Transformer preserves the ability to deal with
the non-local/long-range dependencies.

Besides the performance comparison, we also
study the speed with this simulation task since we
could ignore the affection of padding, masking,
and data processing. We also report the inference
time in the Fig-3b, which shows that Transformer
is faster than LSTM and BiLSTM a lot, and Star-
Transformer is faster than Transformer, especially
on the long sequence.

Transformer could work well on the small dataset
which only has 1400 training samples. Results
of the time-consuming show the Star-Transformer
could be 4.5 times fast than the standard Trans-
former on average.

5.3 Natural Language Inference

Natural Language Inference (NLI) asks the model
to identify the semantic relationship between a
premise sentence and a corresponding hypothesis
sentence. In this paper, we use the Stanford Nat-
ural Language Inference (SNLI) (Bowman et al.,
2015) for evaluation. Since we want to study how
the model encodes the sentence as a vector rep-
resentation, we set Star-Transformer as a sentence
vector-based model and compared it with sentence
vector-based models.

In this experiment, we follow the previous work
(Bowman et al., 2016) to use concat(r1, r2, (cid:107)r1 −
r2(cid:107), r1 − r2) as the classiﬁcation feature. The
r1, r2 are representations of premise and hypoth-
esis sentence, it is calculated by sT + max(HT )
which is same with the classiﬁcation task. See Ap-
pendix for the detail of hyper-parameters.

As shown in Tab-4, the Star-Transformer out-
performs most typical baselines (DiSAN, SPINN)
and achieves comparable results compared with
the state-of-the-art model. Notably, our model
beats standard Transformer by a large margin,
which is easy to overﬁt although we have made
a careful hyper-parameters’ searching for Trans-
former.

Table 4: Test Accuracy on SNLI dataset.

The SNLI dataset is not a small dataset in NLP
area, so improving the generalization ability of the
Transformer is a signiﬁcant topic.

The best result in Tab-4 (Yoon et al., 2018)
using a large network and ﬁne-tuned hyper-
parameters, they get the best result on SNLI but
an undistinguished result on SST, see Tab-2.

5.4 Sequence Labelling

To verify the ability of our model in sequence la-
beling, we choose two classic sequence labeling
tasks: Part-of-Speech (POS) tagging and Named
Entity Recognition (NER) task.

Three datasets are used as our benchmark: one
POS tagging dataset from Penn Treebank (PTB)
(Marcus et al., 1993), and two NER datasets
from CoNLL2003 (Sang and Meulder, 2003),
CoNLL2012 (Pradhan et al., 2012). We use the ﬁ-

nal state of satellite nodes HT to classify the label
in each position. Since we believe that the com-
plex neural network could be an alternative of the
CRF, we also report the result without CRF layer.
As shown in Tab-5, Star-Transformer achieves
the state-of-the-art performance on sequence la-
beling tasks. The “Star-Transformer + Char”
has already beat most of the competitors. Star-
Transformer could achieve such results without
CRF, suggesting that the model has enough ca-
pability to capture the partial ability of the CRF.
The Star-Transformer also outperforms the stan-
dard Transformer on sequence labeling tasks even
the dataset has only 94k training samples.

5.5 Ablation Study

In this section, we perform an ablation study to
test the effectiveness of the radical and ring con-
nections.

We test two variants of our models, the ﬁrst
variants (a) remove the radical connections and
only keep the ring connections. Without the radi-
cal connections, the maximum path length of this

variant becomes O(n). The second variant (b) re-
moves the ring connections and remains the rad-
ical connections. Results in Tab-6 give some in-
sights, the variant (a) loses the ability to han-
dle long-range dependencies, so it performs worse
on both the simulation and real tasks. However,
the performance drops on SNLI and CoNLL03
is moderate since the remained ring connections
still capture the local features. The variant (b)
still works on the simulation task since the max-
imum path length stays unchanged. Without the
ring connections, it loses its performance heavily
on real tasks. Therefore, both the radical and ring
connections are necessary to our model.

6 Conclusion and Future Works

In this paper, we present Star-Transformer which
reduce the computation complexity of the standard
Transformer by carefully sparsifying the topology.
We compare the standard Transformer with other
models on one toy dataset and 21 real datasets
and ﬁnd Star-Transformer outperforms the stan-
dard Transformer and achieves comparable results
with state-of-the-art models.

ability of Star-
Transformer by excluding the factor of unsu-
pervised pre-training.
In the future work, we
will investigate the ability of Star-Transformer
by unsupervised pre-training on the large corpus.
Moreover, we also want to introduce more NLP
prior knowledge into the model.
