Abstract

The variational encoder-decoder (VED) encodes source information as a set of random variables
using a neural network, which in turn is decoded into target data using another neural network. In
natural language processing, sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) models typically serve as encoder-
decoder networks. When combined with a traditional (deterministic) attention mechanism, the
variational latent space may be bypassed by the attention model, and thus becomes ineffective.
In this paper, we propose a variational attention mechanism for VED, where the attention vector
is also modeled as Gaussian distributed random variables. Results on two experiments show that,
without loss of quality, our proposed method alleviates the bypassing phenomenon as it increases
the diversity of generated sentences.1

Introduction

The variational autoencoder (VAE), proposed by Kingma and Welling (2014), encodes data to latent (ran-
dom) variables, and then decodes the latent variables to reconstruct the input data. Theoretically, it opti-
mizes a variational lower bound of the log-likelihood of the data. Compared with traditional variational
methods such as mean-ﬁeld approximation (Wainwright et al., 2008), VAE leverages modern neural net-
works and hence is a more powerful density estimator. Compared with traditional autoencoders (Hinton
and Salakhutdinov, 2006), which are deterministic, VAE populates hidden representations to a region (in-
stead of a single point), making it possible to generate diversiﬁed data from the vector space (Bowman
et al., 2016) or even control the generated samples (Hu et al., 2017).

In natural language processing (NLP), recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are typically used as both the
encoder and decoder, known as a sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) model. Although variational Seq2Seq
models are much trickier to train in comparison to the image domain, Bowman et al. (2016) succeed in
training a sequence-to-sequence VAE and generating sentences from a continuous latent space. Such an
architecture can further be extended to a variational encoder-decoder (VED) to transform one sequence
into another with the “variational” property (Serban et al., 2017; Zhou and Neubig, 2017).

When applying attention mechanisms (Bahdanau et al., 2015) to variational Seq2Seq models, however,
we ﬁnd the generated sentences are of less variety, implying that the variational latent space is ineffec-
tive. The attention mechanism summarizes source information as an attention vector by weighted sum,
where the weights are a learned probabilistic distribution; then the attention vector is fed to the decoder.
Evidence shows that attention signiﬁcantly improves Seq2Seq performance in translation (Bahdanau et
al., 2015), summarization (Rush et al., 2015), etc. In variational Seq2Seq, however, the attention mecha-
nism unfortunately serves as a “bypassing” mechanism. In other words, the variational latent space does
not need to learn much, as long as the attention mechanism itself is powerful enough to capture source
information.

In this paper, we propose a variational attention mechanism to address this problem. We model the
attention vector as random variables by imposing a probabilistic distribution. We follow traditional VAE

and model the prior of the attention vector by a Gaussian distribution, for which we further propose two
plausible priors, whose mean is either a zero vector or an average of source hidden states.

We evaluate our approach on two experiments: question generation and dialog systems. Experiments
show that the proposed variational attention yields a higher diversity than variational Seq2Seq with de-
terministic attention, while retaining high quality of generated sentences. In this way, we make VED
work properly with the powerful attention mechanism.

In summary, the main contributions of this paper are two-fold: (1) We discover a “bypassing” phe-
nomenon in VED, which could make the learning of variational space ineffective. (2) We propose a
variational attention mechanism that models the attention vector as random variables to alleviate the
above problem. To the best of our knowledge, we are the ﬁrst to address the attention mechanism in
variational encoder-decoder neural networks. Our model is a general framework, which can be applied
for various text generation tasks.

2 Background and Motivation

In this section, we introduce the variational autoencoder and the attention mechanism. We also present a
pilot experiment motivating our variational attention model.

2.1 Variational Autoencoder (VAE)

A VAE encodes data Y (e.g., a sentence) as hidden random variables Z, based on which the decoder
reconstructs Y . Consider a generative model, parameterized by θ, as

pθ(Z, Y ) = pθ(Z)pθ(Y |Z)

Given a dataset D = {y(n)}N

n=1, the likelihood of a data point is

log pθ(y(n)) ≥ E

z∼qφ(z|y(n))

log pθ(y(n)|z)

(cid:16)

− KL

qφ(z|y(n))(cid:107)p(z)

(cid:17) ∆= L(n)(θ, φ)

VAE models both qφ(z|y) and pθ(y|z) with neural networks, parametrized by φ and θ, respectively.
Figure 1a shows the graphical model of this process. The training objective is to maximize the lower
bound of the likelihood L(θ, φ), which can be rewritten as minimizing

J (n) = Jrec(θ, φ, y(n)) + KL

(cid:17)
(cid:16)
qφ(z|y(n))(cid:107)p(z)

The ﬁrst term, called reconstruction loss, is the (expected) negative log-likelihood of data, similar to
traditional deterministic autoencoders. The expectation is obtained by Monte Carlo sampling. The sec-
ond term is the KL-divergence between z’s posterior and prior distributions. Typically the prior is set to
standard normal N (0, I).

2.2 Variational Encoder-Decoder (VED)

In some applications, we would like to transform source information to target information, e.g., machine
translation, dialogue systems, and text summarization. In these tasks, “auto”-encoding is not sufﬁcient,
and an encoding-decoding framework is required. Different efforts have been made to extend VAE to
variational encoder-decoder (VED) frameworks, which transform an input X to output Y . One possible
extension is to condition all probabilistic distributions further on X (Zhang et al., 2016; Cao and Clark,
2017; Serban et al., 2017). In this case, the posterior of z is given by qφ(z|X, Y ). This, however,
introduces a discrepancy between training and prediction, since Y is not available during the prediction
stage.

Another approach is to build a recognition model using only X (Zhou and Neubig, 2017). Making the
assumption that Y is a function of X, i.e., Y = Y (X), we have qφ(z|y) = qφ(z|Y (x)) ∆= qφ(z|x).
In this work, we follow Zhou and Neubig (2017) and adopt this extension. Figure 1b shows the graphical
model of the VED used in our work.

2.3 Seq2Seq and Attention Mechanism

In NLP, sequence-to-sequence recurrent neural networks are typically used as the encoder and decoder,
as they are suitable for modeling a sequence of words (i.e., sentence). Figure 2a shows a basic Seq2Seq
model in the VAE/VED scenario (Bowman et al., 2016). The encoder has an input x, and outputs µz and
σz as the parameters of z’s posterior normal distribution. Then a decoder generates y based on a sample
z, drawn from its posterior distribution.

Attention mechanisms are proposed to dynamically align y = (y1, · · · , y|y|) and x = (x1, · · · , x|x|)
during generation. At each time step j in the decoder, the attention mechanism computes a probabilistic
distribution by

exp{(cid:101)αji}
i(cid:48)=1 exp{(cid:101)αji(cid:48)}
where (cid:101)αji is a pre-normalized score, computed by (cid:101)αji = h(tar)

and
are the hidden representations of the jth step in target and ith in the source, and W is a learnable

in our model. Here, h(tar)

Then the source information {h(src)

which is fed to the decoder RNN at the jth step. Figure 2b shows the variational Seq2Seq model with
such traditional attention.

2.4

“Bypassing” Phenomenon

In this part, we explain the “bypassing” phenomenon in VAE/VED, if the network is not designed prop-
erly; this motivates our variational attention described in Section 3.

(c)
Figure 2: (a) Variational Seq2Seq model.
Variational Seq2Seq with hidden state initialization. (d) Variational Seq2Seq with variational attention.

(b) Variational Seq2Seq with deterministic attention.

We observe that, if the decoder has a direct, deterministic access to the source, the latent variables Z
might not capture much information so that the VAE or VED does not play a role in the process. We call
this a bypassing phenomenon.

Theoretically, if pθ(Y |·) is aware of X by itself, i.e., pθ(Y |·) becomes pθ(Y |X, Z), it could be
learned as pθ(Y |X) without hurting the reconstruction loss Jrec, but the KL term in Eq. (3) can be min-
imized by ﬁtting the posterior to its prior. This degrades a variational Seq2Seq model to a deterministic
one.

The phenomenon can be best shown with a bypassing connection between the encoder and decoder
for hidden state initialization. Some previous studies using VEDs set the decoder’s initial state to be
the encoder’s ﬁnal state (Cao and Clark, 2017), shown in Figure 2c. We conducted a pilot study with a
Seq2Seq VAE with a subset (∼80k samples) of the massive dataset provided by Bowman et al. (2015),
and show generated sentences and entropy in Table 1. We see that the variational Seq2Seq can only
generate very similar sentences with such bypassing connections (Table 1b), as opposed to generating
diversiﬁed samples from the latent space (Table 1a). We also computed the entropy for 10 randomly
sampled outputs for a given input sentence. Quantitatively, the entropy decreases by 0.5 on average for
1k unseen input sentences. This shows a signiﬁcant difference because entropy is a logarithmic metric.
Our analysis sheds light on the design philosophy of neural architectures in VAE or VED.

Since attention largely improves model performance for deterministic Seq2Seq models, it is tempting
to include attention in the variational Seq2Seq as well. However, our pilot experiment raises the doubt
if a traditional attention mechanism, which is deterministic, may bypass the latent space in VED, as
illustrated by a graphical model in Figure 1c. Also, evidence in Zheng et al. (2018) shows the attention
mechanism is so powerful that removing other connections between the encoder and decoder has little
effect on BLEU scores in machine translation. Therefore, a VED with deterministic attention might learn
reconstruction mostly from attention, whereas the posterior of the latent space can ﬁt to its prior in order
to minimize the KL term.

To alleviate this problem, we propose a variational attention mechanism for variational Seq2Seq mod-

els, as is described in detail in the next section.

3 The Proposed Variational Attention

Let us consider the decoding process of an RNN. At each timestep j, it adjusts its hidden state h(tar)
j with
an input of a word embedding yj−1 (typically the groundtruth during training and the prediction from
the previous step during testing). This is given by h(tar)
j−1, yj−1). In our experiments, we
use long short-term memory units (Hochreiter and Schmidhuber, 1997) as RNN’s transition. Enhanced

j = RNNθ(h(tar)

with attention, the RNN is computed by h(tar)
by a softmax layer p(yj) = softmax(Wouth(tar)
traditional attention computes aj in a deterministic fashion by Eq. (5).

j = RNNθ(h(tar)

j−1, [yj−1; aj]). The predicted word is given
), where Wout is a weight matrix. As discussed earlier,

j

To build a variational attention, we treat both the traditional latent space z and the attention vector aj

as random variables. The recognition and reconstruction graphical models are shown in Figure 1d.

3.1 Lower Bound

Since the likelihood of the nth data point decomposes for different time steps, we consider the lower
bound L(n)

(θ, φ) at the jth step. The variational lower bound in Eq. (2) becomes

(cid:105)

Eq. (7) is due to the independence in both recognition and reconstruction phrases. The posterior factor-
izes as qφ(z, a|·) = q(z)
φ (a|·) because z and a are conditionally independent given x (dashed
lines in Figure 1d), whereas the prior factorizes because z and a are marginally independent (solid lines
in Figure 1d). In this way, the sampling procedure can be done separately and the KL loss can also be
computed independently.

φ (z|·) q(a)

3.2 Prior

We propose two plausible prior distributions for aj.

• The simplest prior, perhaps, is the standard normal, i.e., p(aj) = N (0, I). This follows the prior
of the latent space z as in a conventional autoencoder (Kingma and Welling, 2014; Bowman et al.,
2016).

• We observe that the attention vector has to be inside the convex hull of hidden representations of the
}. We impose a normal prior whose mean is the average of
, making the prior non-informative.

3.3 Posterior
We model the posterior of q(a)
φ (aj|x) as a normal distribution N (µaj , σaj ), where the parameters µaj
and σaj are obtained by a recognition neural network. Similar to VAEs, we compute parameters as if in
the deterministic attention in Eq. (5) (denoted by adet
in this part) and then transform them by another
j
layer, shown in Figure 2d.

For the mean µaj , we apply an identity transformation, i.e., µaj ≡ adet

j . The identify transformation
makes much sense as it preserves the spirit of “attention.” To compute σaj , we ﬁrst transform adet
j by a
neural layer with tanh activation. The resulting vector then undergoes a linear transformation followed
by an exp activation function to ensure that the values are positive.

3.4 Training Objective

The overall training objective of Seq2Seq with both variational latent space z and variational attention a
is to minimize

Here, we have a hyperparameter λKL to balance the reconstruction loss and KL losses. γa further
balances the attention’s KL loss and z’s KL loss. Since VAE and VED are tricky with Seq2Seq models

Figure 3: Geometric interpretation of attention mechanisms.

(e.g., requiring KL annealing), we tie the change of both KL terms and only anneal λKL. (Training
details will be presented in Section 4.1.)

Notice that if aj has a prior of N (¯h(src), I), the derivative of the KL term also goes to ¯h(src). This can

be computed straightforwardly or by auto-differentiation tools, e.g., TensorFlow.

3.5 Geometric Interpretation

We present a geometric interpretation of both deterministic and variational attention mechanisms in
Figure 3.

Suppose the hidden representations h(src)

is of k-dimensional space (represented as a 3-d space in
}|x|
Figure 3). In the deterministic mechanism, the attention model is a convex combination of {h(src)
i=1,
as the weights in Eq. (5) are a probabilistic distribution. The attention vector aj is a point in the convex
hull conv{h(src)

}, shown in Figure 3a.

(indicated by red arrows).

For variational attention in Figures 3b and 3c, the mean of posterior is still in the convex hull, but
the sample drawn from the posterior is populated over the entire space (although mostly around the
mean, shown as a ball). The difference between the two variants is that the standard normal prior
N (0, I) pulls the posterior to the origin, whereas the prior N (¯h(src), I) pulls the posterior to the mean of
h(src)
1
Finally we would like to present a (potential) alternative of modeling variational attention. Instead of
treating aj as random variables, we might also treat αj as random variables. Since αj is the parameter
of a categorical distribution, its conjugate prior is a Dirichlet distribution. In this case, the resulting
attention vector populates the entire convex hull (Figure 3d). However, it relies on a reparametrization
trick to propagate reconstruction error’s gradient back to the recognition neural network (Kingma and
Welling, 2014). In other words, the sampling of latent variables should be drawn from a ﬁxed distribution
(without parameters) and then transformed to a desired sample using the distribution’s parameters. This
is nontrivial for Dirichlet distributions and further research is needed to address this problem.

4 Experiments

We evaluated our model on two tasks: question generation (Section 4.1) and dialog systems (Section 4.2).

4.1 Experiment I: Question Generation

Task, Dataset, and Metrics. We ﬁrst evaluated our approach on a question generation task. It uses the
Stanford Question Answering Dataset (Rajpurkar et al., 2016, SQuAD), and aims to generate questions
based on a sentence in a paragraph. We used the same train-validation-test split as in Du et al. (2017).
According to Du et al. (2017), the attention mechanism is especially critical in this task in order to
generate relevant questions. Also, generated questions do need some variety (e.g., in the creation of
reading comprehension datasets), as opposed to machine translation, which is typically deterministic.

We followed Du et al. (2017) and used BLEU-1 to BLEU-4 scores (Papineni et al., 2002) to evaluate
the quality (in the sense of accuracy) of generated sentences. Besides, we adopted entropy and distinct
metrics to measure the diversity. Entropy is computed as − (cid:80)
w p(w) log p(w), where p(·) is the unigram
probability in generated sentences. Distinct metrics—used in previous works to measure diversity (Li
et al., 2016)—computes the percentage of distinct unigrams or bigrams (denoted as Dist-1 and Dist-2,
respectively).

Table 2: BLEU, entropy, and distinct scores. We compare the deterministic encoder-decoder (DED)
and variational encoder-decoders (VEDs). For VED, we have several variates: deterministic attention
(DAttn) and the proposed variational attention (VAttn). Variational models are evaluated by both max a
posteriori (MAP) inference and sampling.

Training Details. We used LSTM-RNNs with 100 hidden units for both the encoder and decoder;
the dimension of the latent vector z was also 100d. We adopted 300d word embeddings (Mikolov et al.,
2013), pretrained on the SQuAD dataset. For both the source and target sides, the vocabulary was limited
to the most frequent 40k tokens. We used the Adam optimizer (Kingma and Ba, 2015) to train all models,
with an initial learning rate of 0.005, a multiplicative decay of 0.95, and other default hyperparameters.
The batch size was set to be 100.

As shown in Bowman et al. (2016), Seq2Seq VAE is hard to train because of the issues associated
with the KL term vanishing to zero. Following Bowman et al. (2016), we adopted KL cost annealing
and word dropout during training. The coefﬁcient of the KL term λKL was gradually increased using
a logistic annealing schedule, allowing the model to learn to reconstruct the input accurately during the
early stages of training. A ﬁxed word dropout rate of 25% was used.

All the hyperparameter tuning was based on validation performance on the motivating Seq2Seq VAE
discussed in Section 2.4, and the same hyperparameters were used for all of the models described in
Section 3.

Overall Performance. Table 2 represents the performance of various models. We ﬁrst implemented a
traditional vanilla Seq2Seq model, which we call a deterministic encoder-decoder (DED), and generally
replicated the results on the question generation task as reported in Du et al. (2017), showing that our
implementation is fair. Incorporating attention mechanism in this model (DED+DAttn) improves BLEU
scores, as expected. In the variational encoder-decoder (VED) framework, we report results obtained by
both max a posterior (MAP) inference as well as sampling. In the sampling setting, we draw 10 samples
(z and/or a) from the posterior given x for each data point, and report average BLEU scores.

The proposed variational attention model (VED+VAttn) largely outperforms deterministic attention
(VED+DAttn) in terms of all diversity metrics. It should be noted that entropy is a logarithmic measure,
and hence a difference of 0.1 in Table 2 is signiﬁcant; VED+VAttn also generates more distinct unigrams
and bigrams than VED+DAttn.

Regarding the prior of variational attention, we propose two variants: N (0, I) and N (¯h(src), I), de-
noted as VED+VAttn-0 and VED+VAttn-¯h, respectively. VED+VAttn-0 has slightly lower BLEU but
higher diversity. The results are generally comparable, showing both priors are reasonable.

We also tried a heuristic of 2-stage training (VED+DAttn 2-stage), in which the VED is ﬁrst trained
without attention for 6 epochs, and then the attention mechanism is added to the model. This heuristic is
proposed in hopes of better training the variational latent space at the beginning stages. However, exper-
iments show that such simple heuristic does not help much, and is worse than the principled variational
attention mechanism in terms of all BLEU and diversity metrics.

Human Evaluation.
In order to assess the quality of the generated text in terms of language ﬂuency,
a human evaluation study was carried out. For each of the two models under comparison (VED+DAttn
and VED+VAttn-¯h), a randomly shufﬂed subset of 100 generated questions were selected. Six human
evaluators were asked to rate the ﬂuency of these 200 questions on a 5-point scale: 5-Flawless, 4-Good,
3-Adequate, 2-Poor, 1-Incomprehensible, following Stent et al. (2005). The average rating obtained for
VED+DAttn was 3.99 and for VED+VAttn-¯h was 4.01, the difference between which is not statistically
signiﬁcant. The human annotations achieved 0.61 average Spearman correlation coefﬁcient (measuring
order correlation) between any two annotators. According to Swinscow (1976), this indicates moderate
to strong correlation among different annotators. Hence, we conclude variational attention does not
negatively affect the ﬂuency of sentences.

Learning curves. Figure 4 shows the trends of sentence quality (BLEU-2 and BLEU-4) and diversity
(entropy and Dist-1) of all models on the validation set, as training progresses.2 We see that BLEU
and diversity are conﬂicting objectives: a high BLEU score indicates resemblance to the groundtruth,
resulting in low diversity. However, the variational attention mechanisms (red and green lines in Figure 4)
remain high in both aspects, showing the effectiveness of our model.

Strength of Attention’s KL Loss. We tuned the KL term’s strength in variational attention, i.e., γa
in Eq. (8), and plot the BLEU and diversity metrics in Figure 5.
In this experiment, we used the
VED+DAttn-¯h variant. As shown, a decrease in γa increases the quality of generated sentences at the
cost of diversity. This is expected because a lower γa gives the model less incentive to optimize the
attention’s KL term, which then causes the model to behave more “deterministic.” Based on this experi-

2Other metrics are omitted because the trend is the same.

ment, we chose a value of 0.1 for γa, as it yields a learning curve in the middle among those of different
hyperparameters, being a good balance between quality and diversity.

It should be further mentioned that, with a milder γa (e.g., 0.01), VED+VAttn outperforms
VED+DAttn in terms of both quality and diversity (on the validation set). This is consistent with the
evidence that variational latent space may serve as a way of regularization and improves quality (Zhang
et al., 2016). However, a small γa only slightly improves diversity, and hence we did not choose this
hyperparameter in Table 2.

Case study. We show in Table 3 two examples of generated sentences by VED+DAttn and
VED+VAttn-¯h, each containing three random sentences drawn from the variational latent space(s) for
a given input. In both examples, the variational attention generates more diversiﬁed sentences than de-
terministic attention. The quality of generated sentences is close in both models.

4.2 Experiment II: Dialog Systems

We present another experiment on generative conversation systems. The goal is to generate a reply based
on a user-issued utterance. We used the Cornell Movie-Dialogs Corpus3 (Danescu-Niculescu-Mizil and
Lee, 2011) as our dataset, which contains more than 200k conversational exchanges. All the settings
in this experiment were the same as in Subsection 4.1 except that we had 30k words as the vocabulary
for both the encoder and decoder. We evaluated the quality of generated replies with BLEU-2, as it has
been observed to be more or less correlated with human annotators among the BLEU metrics (Liu et al.,
2016).

Table 4 shows the performance of our model (VED-VAttn-¯h) compared with two main baselines.
We see that VEDs are slightly worse than the deterministic encoder-decoder (DED) in this experiment.
However, variational attention outperforms deterministic attention in terms of both quality and diversity,
showing that our model is effective in different applications. However, we ﬁnd the improvement is not
so large as in the previous experiment. We conjecture that in conversational systems, there is a weaker
alignment between the source and target information. Hence, the attention mechanism itself is less
effective.

5 Related Work

The variational autoencoder (VAE) was proposed by Kingma and Welling (2014) for image generation.
In NLP, it has been used to generate sentences (Bowman et al., 2016). Serban et al. (2017) propose a
variational encoder-decoder (VED) model to generate better (more diverse and thus meaningful) replies
in a dialog system. VED frameworks have also been applied to knowledge base reasoning (Zhang et al.,
2018). Another thread of VAE/VED applications is to control some characteristics of generated data,
such as the angle of a face image (Kumar et al., 2017), and the sentiment of a sentence (Hu et al., 2017).
In this paper, the focus is on the scenario where VED is combined with attention mechanism. We
show that the variational attention space is effective, in terms of the diversity of sampled sentences (since
VEDs are probabilistic models). Although previous studies have addressed diversity using diversiﬁed
beam search (Vijayakumar et al., 2016) and determinantal point processes (Song et al., 2018), we would
like to point out that our paper is “orthogonal” to those studies. The diversity in our approach arises

through probabilistic modeling, as opposed to a manually speciﬁed heuristic function of the diversity
metric. It is to be noted that our approach can be naturally combined with the above methods.

6 Conclusion and Future Work

In this paper, we proposed a variational attention mechanism for variational encoder-decoder (VED)
frameworks. We observe that, in VEDs, if the decoder has direct access to the encoder, the connection
may bypass the variational space. Traditional attention mechanisms might serve as bypassing connection,
making the output less diverse. Our variational attention mechanism imposes a probabilistic distribution
on the attention vector. We also proposed different priors for the attention vector. The proposed model
was evaluated on two tasks: question generation and dialog systems, showing that variational attention
yields more diversiﬁed samples while retaining high quality.

In future work, it would be interesting to investigate VEDs that model the attention probability with
Dirichlet distributions (see Figure 3d). Our framework also provides a principled methodology for de-
signing variational encoding-decoding models without the bypassing phenomenon.
