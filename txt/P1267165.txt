Abstract

This paper presents an augmentation of MSCOCO dataset
where speech is added to image and text. Speech captions
are generated using text-to-speech (TTS) synthesis resulting in
616,767 spoken captions (more than 600h) paired with images.
Disﬂuencies and speed perturbation are added to the signal in
order to sound more natural. Each speech signal (WAV) is
paired with a JSON ﬁle containing exact timecode for each
word/syllable/phoneme in the spoken caption. Such a corpus
could be used for Language and Vision (LaVi) tasks including
speech input or output instead of text. Investigating multimodal
learning schemes for unsupervised speech pattern discovery is
also possible with this corpus, as demonstrated by a preliminary
study conducted on a subset of the corpus (10h, 10k spoken cap-
tions).

1. Introduction

During the past few years, there has been an increasing interest
in research gathering language and vision (LaVi) communities.
This trend can be explained by the availability of multimodal
corpora such as Flickr30k [1] or MSCOCO [2], containing im-
ages and their captions in natural language text. LaVi systems
also have beneﬁted from the introduction of neural encoder-
decoder approaches [3, 4] that allow text to be generated from
images or speech (or vice-versa), or to learn joint embeddings
of images and text [5].

After the pioneering work done at MIT 15 years ago [6],
these recent advances have also fueled fundamental research in
(grounded) language acquisition and understanding (linguistics,
cognitive science, autonomous robotics) as well as in more ap-
plied research to solve tasks such as image captioning [7] or
visual question answering [8].

While many benchmark image datasets have been designed
to assess the quality of machine-generated image descriptions
(for a survey see [7]), speech modality has been less focused
on, probably because of the lack of large corpora for conduct-
ing such studies. In fact, except the augmentation of Flickr8k
dataset (by collecting a corpus of 40,000 spoken captions using
Amazon Mechanical Turk - AMT) proposed by [9] which lead
to the following research papers [10, 11], very few researches
on spoken language and vision were conducted so far.

Paper contributions.
This paper proposes a dataset that is an order of magnitude
bigger than what is already available (600k spoken captions in-
stead of 40k in [9]). Our dataset is built on top of MSCOCO
[2] and contains more than 600,000 spoken captions (we will
refer to it as SPEECH-COCO in the rest of this paper). We be-
lieve that this corpus may be useful for further Language and

Vision (LaVi) tasks including speech input or output instead of
text. The data set is made available online1. Moreover, speech
data is perfectly annotated (does not rely on error-prone forced
alignment) since the annotations are produced during the TTS
process itself (at word, syllable and phone level).

Paper outline.

This paper is organized as following.

In section 2, we
quickly review existing corpora usable for visually grounded
language acquisition and motivates the choice of MSCOCO as
a starting point. In section 3, we present our general method-
ology and describe the spoken caption generation itself while
section 4 presents some analysis on SPEECH-COCO as well as
its ﬁrst use for an unsupervised word discovery task. Finally,
section 5 concludes this work and gives some perspectives.

2. Existing Corpora of Visually Grounded
Speech

Flickr30K [1] (an extension of Flickr8K [12]) and MSCOCO
[2] are now widely used in LaVi community. We can also men-
tion the Visual Genome dataset, an ongoing effort to connect
structured image concepts to language [13]. For a broader sur-
vey on image captioning datasets, the reader may refer to [7].

Flickr8K and Flickr30K contain images from Flickr with
approximately 8,000 and 30,000 images, respectively. The im-
ages in these two datasets were selected through user queries
for speciﬁc objects and actions. Both contain ﬁve descriptions
per image which were collected using a crowdsourcing platform
(AMT).

The MSCOCO dataset currently consists of 123,287 im-
ages with ﬁve different descriptions per image. Images in this
dataset are annotated for 80 object categories and bounding
boxes around all instances in one of these categories are avail-
able for all images. The MSCOCO dataset has been widely
used for automatic image captioning. Several extensions of
MSCOCO are currently under development, including the ad-
dition of questions&answers for Visual Question Answering
(VQA) task2 or FOIL-COCO (Find One mismatch between Im-
age and Language caption) which consists of images associated
with incorrect captions to challenge existing LaVi models3.

Concerning spoken captions, AMT recordings were ob-
tained from Flickr8K by [9] but only 40k captions are made
available online4. In addition, time-coded annotations are ob-

tained after alignment of speech data with transcripts through
(error-prone) automatic forced-alignment. Very recently, spo-
ken captions for MSCOCO were generated using Google TTS
by [14]. However, only one TTS voice was used limiting the
speaker variability.

3. SPEECH-COCO: Adding Spoken
Captions to MSCOCO

3.1. Our Starting Point: MSCOCO

We used Microsoft’s Common Objects in Context (MSCOCO)
[2] training and validation datasets as our starting point.
In
MSCOCO, each image is described by at least ﬁve descriptions
written by humans. The images contain 91 common object cat-
egories (e.g. dog, elephant, bird, car, bicycle, air plane, etc.)
from 11 super-categories (Animal, Vehicle, etc.), with 82 of
them having more than 5K labelled instances. In total there are
123,287 images with captions (82,783 for training and 40,504
for validation). The test set is not available for download since
it is used on an evaluation server for continuous benchmarking
of image captioning systems. Consequently, 616,767 captions
from 123,287 images are available for download.

3.2. Spoken Captions Generation

Synthetic speech was generated for each caption using Voxy-
gen5, a commercial speech synthesis system, for 4 different UK
voices (Paul, Elizabeth, Judith and Bronwen) and 4 different
It is important
US voices (Phil, Bruce, Amanda and Jenny).
to note that this is corpus-based concatenative speech synthesis
[15] and not parametric synthesis. So, for each speaker’s voice,
speech utterances are generated by concatenation of units mined
from a large speech corpus (generally around 3000 sentences/s-
peaker). This means that despite having little intra-speaker vari-
ability in our speech data, there is a realistic level of inter-
speaker variability, as opposed to the small corpus proposed in
[14].

On average, each caption comprises 10.79 tokens. The

WAV ﬁles are on average 3.52 second long.

3.3. Adding Variability

First, we applied speed perturbation on the spoken captions to
introduce intra-speaker variability in the dataset. For this, we
used the tempo function of Sox6 audio manipulation tool. This
simple processing only changes speech rate while trying to keep
the same pitch and spectral enveloppe. Our recordings were
either accelerated (speed x 1.1), slowed down (speed x 0.9) or
kept unchanged with equal probability of event.

Second, we added disﬂuencies to some of the captions so
that they would sound more natural. We chose to only include
ﬁllers (such as ”um”, ”uh”, ”er”, ”huh”, ”oh” and ”ah”). It was
shown that ﬁllers often occur when speakers have to face an
heavy processing load (when describing an image for example)
and that they also act as coordinators [16]. Thus, adding ﬁllers
to some captions is legitimate and makes the corpus more re-
alistic. The probability of adding a ﬁller to any given caption
was set to 0.3. The ﬁllers were either added at the beginning, at
the end or in the middle of a caption with equal probability of
event.

4. Spoken Corpus Analysis

4.1. Metadata and scripts

We adopted the following naming convention for both the WAV
and JSON ﬁles:

imageID captionID Speaker DisﬂuencyPosition Speed

Each WAV ﬁle is paired with a JSON ﬁle containing various
information: timecode of each word in the caption, name of the
speaker, name of the WAV ﬁle, etc. The JSON ﬁles have the
following data structure:
{

"duration": float,
"speaker": string,
"synthesisedCaption": string,
"timecode": list,
"speed": float,
"wavFilename": string,
"captionID": int,
"imgID": int,
"disfluency": list

}

We also created a Python script7 which handles the meta-
data, so that the user can easily make use of the corpus. The
script has the following features:

• Aggregate all the information in the JSON ﬁles into a

single SQLite database

• Find captions according to speciﬁc ﬁlters (name, gender
and nationality of the speaker, disﬂuency position, speed,
duration, and words in the caption). The script automati-
cally builds the SQLite query. The user can also provide
his own SQLite query.

• Find all the captions belonging to a speciﬁc image
• Parse the timecodes and have them structured
• Get the words, syllables and phonemes timecodes
• Convert the timecodes to Praat TextGrid ﬁles (see Figure

1)

4.2. Analysis of intra and inter speaker variability

To be sure that our corpus is realistic enough, we computed in-
ter and intra speaker variability measures on a subset of 100
captions corresponding to 20 images and added 2 additional
voices to our 8 synthetic voices for these captions: a real voice
(William) and Google TTS (gTTS). We then extracted words
that were repeated across sentences and analyzed their intra and
inter speaker variability using Dynamic Time Warping (DTW)
computed for all occurrences of the same word by the same
speaker (e.g. Amanda vs Amanda) and for all the occurrences of
the same word pronounced by different speakers (e.g Amanda
vs. Bronwen, Amanda vs. Bruce, etc.).

As expected, intra speaker variability is lower than inter-
speaker variability but we remark that there is not big differ-
ences between intra speaker variability of a real voice (William)
and the intra speaker variability of a synthetic voice (Amanda
for instance).
Inter speaker variability is slightly greater be-
tween the real human voice (William) and the other synthetic
voices, but inter speaker variability between synthetic voices
is still high, meaning our synthetic corpus should be difﬁcult
enough for tasks such as unsupervised term discovery (UTD)
accross a collection of speech utterances from multiple speak-
ers. This is what we intend to show in a preliminary experiment,
in the next subsection.

clusters also seem to be purer than the global clusters since the
within-speaker precision for the grouping task is higher than
the global precision. Grouping recall indicates that speech seg-
ments which should have been in the same clusters have been
assigned to different clusters. Finally, the low coverage and
matching recall clearly indicate that a lot of work has to be done
in order to get the most out of the available data and that SDTW
alone might not be enough to fully segment speech utterances.
For instance, modeling prosodic features could be of great help.
To summarize, this experiment with an off-the-shelf toolkit,
shows that our synthetic corpus of spoken captions is difﬁcult
enough for UTD task.

Table 2 shows examples of clusters found by the UTD sys-
tem along with the corresponding images of MSCOCO. As
shown in Table 1, segments rarely match single tokens. How-
ever, Table 2 shows that they often match frequent n-grams (”a
man riding”, ”ﬁre hydrant” and ”skiing down”) and multiword
expressions (MWE) such as ”a bunch of bananas”. As such,
adding a new metric to TDE that would assess the quality of
the segmentation according to gold chunks and MWE would be
interesting.

5. Japanese translations

A further augmentation of MSCOCO was created by [?] where
Japanese captions were collected using the same methodology
as [?]. This corpus comprises 131,740 captions for 26,500 im-
ages. As the augmentation created by [?] does not provided a
Japanese version for all of the captions, we used Machine Trans-
lation (MT)9 to translate all the available English captions to
Japanese. This allows SPEECH-COCO to be used for cross-
modal studies using speech, images, text and translations.

6. Conclusion

In this paper, we have presented SPEECH-COCO, an exten-
sion of the MSCOCO image recognition and captioning dataset,
which consists of more than 604 hours of speech.

spoken captions (subset of 100 speech signals corresponding to
20 images)

4.3. Unsupervised Term Discovery (UTD)

For UTD, we use the Zero Resource Toolkit (ZRTools [17]).
ZRTools uses segmental dynamic time warping (SDTW) to dis-
cover pairs of acoustically similar audio segments, and then
uses graph clustering on overlapping pairs to form a hard clus-
tering of the discovered segments. Replacing each discovered
segment with its unique cluster label, or pseudoterm, gives us a
partial, noisy transcription, or pseudotext.

To evaluate UTD performance, we used the term discovery
evaluation toolkit (TDE) [18]. UTD was done on a subset of
the corpus (10,000 captions which represent approximately 10
hours of speech) and the results are reported in Table 1.

Our results conﬁrm that the UTD task is still difﬁcult even if
our corpus is synthetic: we found very few gold tokens (low pre-
cision and even lower recall8). There is very little difference be-
tween the global precision and the within-speaker precision for
the matching task, suggesting that the clusters mainly consist of
speech segments belonging to the same speaker. Within-speaker

8TDE only gives three signiﬁcant ﬁgures after the decimal point.

Since our results are very low, there were rounded up to 0.000

The addition of speech as a new modality enables
SPEECH-COCO to be used in different ﬁelds of research
including language acquisition, visually-grounded word dis-
covery and keyword spotting, and semantic embedding using
speech and vision.

This corpus has been used during the Jelinek Memorial
Workshop on Speech and Language Technology (JSALT) 2017
jointly organized by CMU and JHU (Speaking Rosetta Stone
team on discovering grounded linguistic units for languages
without orthography).

We list below a list of topics that are as many LaVi tasks

possible with SPEECH-COCO:

• spoken caption generation from images (generating

speech from images),

• visually-grounded spoken term discovery,

• cross-modal speech-image-text studies,

• image generation from speech input,

• simulating language documentation tasks where speech

has been elicited from images,

• effect of visual context on computational language ac-

quisition,

• (spoken) visual question answering,

• data augmentation by adding synthetic multi-modal data

to more naturalistic (but small) corpora.

Abstract

This paper presents an augmentation of MSCOCO dataset
where speech is added to image and text. Speech captions
are generated using text-to-speech (TTS) synthesis resulting in
616,767 spoken captions (more than 600h) paired with images.
Disﬂuencies and speed perturbation are added to the signal in
order to sound more natural. Each speech signal (WAV) is
paired with a JSON ﬁle containing exact timecode for each
word/syllable/phoneme in the spoken caption. Such a corpus
could be used for Language and Vision (LaVi) tasks including
speech input or output instead of text. Investigating multimodal
learning schemes for unsupervised speech pattern discovery is
also possible with this corpus, as demonstrated by a preliminary
study conducted on a subset of the corpus (10h, 10k spoken cap-
tions).

1. Introduction

During the past few years, there has been an increasing interest
in research gathering language and vision (LaVi) communities.
This trend can be explained by the availability of multimodal
corpora such as Flickr30k [1] or MSCOCO [2], containing im-
ages and their captions in natural language text. LaVi systems
also have beneﬁted from the introduction of neural encoder-
decoder approaches [3, 4] that allow text to be generated from
images or speech (or vice-versa), or to learn joint embeddings
of images and text [5].

After the pioneering work done at MIT 15 years ago [6],
these recent advances have also fueled fundamental research in
(grounded) language acquisition and understanding (linguistics,
cognitive science, autonomous robotics) as well as in more ap-
plied research to solve tasks such as image captioning [7] or
visual question answering [8].

While many benchmark image datasets have been designed
to assess the quality of machine-generated image descriptions
(for a survey see [7]), speech modality has been less focused
on, probably because of the lack of large corpora for conduct-
ing such studies. In fact, except the augmentation of Flickr8k
dataset (by collecting a corpus of 40,000 spoken captions using
Amazon Mechanical Turk - AMT) proposed by [9] which lead
to the following research papers [10, 11], very few researches
on spoken language and vision were conducted so far.

This paper proposes a dataset that is an order of magnitude
bigger than what is already available (600k spoken captions in-
stead of 40k in [9]). Our dataset is built on top of MSCOCO
[2] and contains more than 600,000 spoken captions (we will
refer to it as SPEECH-COCO in the rest of this paper). We be-
lieve that this corpus may be useful for further Language and

Vision (LaVi) tasks including speech input or output instead of
text. The data set is made available online1. Moreover, speech
data is perfectly annotated (does not rely on error-prone forced
alignment) since the annotations are produced during the TTS
process itself (at word, syllable and phone level).

Paper outline.

This paper is organized as following.

In section 2, we
quickly review existing corpora usable for visually grounded
language acquisition and motivates the choice of MSCOCO as
a starting point. In section 3, we present our general method-
ology and describe the spoken caption generation itself while
section 4 presents some analysis on SPEECH-COCO as well as
its ﬁrst use for an unsupervised word discovery task. Finally,
section 5 concludes this work and gives some perspectives.

2. Existing Corpora of Visually Grounded
Speech

Flickr30K [1] (an extension of Flickr8K [12]) and MSCOCO
[2] are now widely used in LaVi community. We can also men-
tion the Visual Genome dataset, an ongoing effort to connect
structured image concepts to language [13]. For a broader sur-
vey on image captioning datasets, the reader may refer to [7].

Flickr8K and Flickr30K contain images from Flickr with
approximately 8,000 and 30,000 images, respectively. The im-
ages in these two datasets were selected through user queries
for speciﬁc objects and actions. Both contain ﬁve descriptions
per image which were collected using a crowdsourcing platform
(AMT).

The MSCOCO dataset currently consists of 123,287 im-
ages with ﬁve different descriptions per image. Images in this
dataset are annotated for 80 object categories and bounding
boxes around all instances in one of these categories are avail-
able for all images. The MSCOCO dataset has been widely
used for automatic image captioning. Several extensions of
MSCOCO are currently under development, including the ad-
dition of questions&answers for Visual Question Answering
(VQA) task2 or FOIL-COCO (Find One mismatch between Im-
age and Language caption) which consists of images associated
with incorrect captions to challenge existing LaVi models3.

Concerning spoken captions, AMT recordings were ob-
tained from Flickr8K by [9] but only 40k captions are made
available online4. In addition, time-coded annotations are ob-

tained after alignment of speech data with transcripts through
(error-prone) automatic forced-alignment. Very recently, spo-
ken captions for MSCOCO were generated using Google TTS
by [14]. However, only one TTS voice was used limiting the
speaker variability.

3. SPEECH-COCO: Adding Spoken
Captions to MSCOCO

3.1. Our Starting Point: MSCOCO

We used Microsoft’s Common Objects in Context (MSCOCO)
[2] training and validation datasets as our starting point.
In
MSCOCO, each image is described by at least ﬁve descriptions
written by humans. The images contain 91 common object cat-
egories (e.g. dog, elephant, bird, car, bicycle, air plane, etc.)
from 11 super-categories (Animal, Vehicle, etc.), with 82 of
them having more than 5K labelled instances. In total there are
123,287 images with captions (82,783 for training and 40,504
for validation). The test set is not available for download since
it is used on an evaluation server for continuous benchmarking
of image captioning systems. Consequently, 616,767 captions
from 123,287 images are available for download.

3.2. Spoken Captions Generation

Synthetic speech was generated for each caption using Voxy-
gen5, a commercial speech synthesis system, for 4 different UK
voices (Paul, Elizabeth, Judith and Bronwen) and 4 different
It is important
US voices (Phil, Bruce, Amanda and Jenny).
to note that this is corpus-based concatenative speech synthesis
[15] and not parametric synthesis. So, for each speaker’s voice,
speech utterances are generated by concatenation of units mined
from a large speech corpus (generally around 3000 sentences/s-
peaker). This means that despite having little intra-speaker vari-
ability in our speech data, there is a realistic level of inter-
speaker variability, as opposed to the small corpus proposed in
[14].

On average, each caption comprises 10.79 tokens. The

WAV ﬁles are on average 3.52 second long.

3.3. Adding Variability

First, we applied speed perturbation on the spoken captions to
introduce intra-speaker variability in the dataset. For this, we
used the tempo function of Sox6 audio manipulation tool. This
simple processing only changes speech rate while trying to keep
the same pitch and spectral enveloppe. Our recordings were
either accelerated (speed x 1.1), slowed down (speed x 0.9) or
kept unchanged with equal probability of event.

Second, we added disﬂuencies to some of the captions so
that they would sound more natural. We chose to only include
ﬁllers (such as ”um”, ”uh”, ”er”, ”huh”, ”oh” and ”ah”). It was
shown that ﬁllers often occur when speakers have to face an
heavy processing load (when describing an image for example)
and that they also act as coordinators [16]. Thus, adding ﬁllers
to some captions is legitimate and makes the corpus more re-
alistic. The probability of adding a ﬁller to any given caption
was set to 0.3. The ﬁllers were either added at the beginning, at
the end or in the middle of a caption with equal probability of
event.

4. Spoken Corpus Analysis

4.1. Metadata and scripts

We adopted the following naming convention for both the WAV
and JSON ﬁles:

imageID captionID Speaker DisﬂuencyPosition Speed

Each WAV ﬁle is paired with a JSON ﬁle containing various
information: timecode of each word in the caption, name of the
speaker, name of the WAV ﬁle, etc. The JSON ﬁles have the
following data structure:
{

"duration": float,
"speaker": string,
"synthesisedCaption": string,
"timecode": list,
"speed": float,
"wavFilename": string,
"captionID": int,
"imgID": int,
"disfluency": list

}

We also created a Python script7 which handles the meta-
data, so that the user can easily make use of the corpus. The
script has the following features:

• Aggregate all the information in the JSON ﬁles into a

single SQLite database

• Find captions according to speciﬁc ﬁlters (name, gender
and nationality of the speaker, disﬂuency position, speed,
duration, and words in the caption). The script automati-
cally builds the SQLite query. The user can also provide
his own SQLite query.

• Find all the captions belonging to a speciﬁc image
• Parse the timecodes and have them structured
• Get the words, syllables and phonemes timecodes
• Convert the timecodes to Praat TextGrid ﬁles (see Figure

1)

4.2. Analysis of intra and inter speaker variability

To be sure that our corpus is realistic enough, we computed in-
ter and intra speaker variability measures on a subset of 100
captions corresponding to 20 images and added 2 additional
voices to our 8 synthetic voices for these captions: a real voice
(William) and Google TTS (gTTS). We then extracted words
that were repeated across sentences and analyzed their intra and
inter speaker variability using Dynamic Time Warping (DTW)
computed for all occurrences of the same word by the same
speaker (e.g. Amanda vs Amanda) and for all the occurrences of
the same word pronounced by different speakers (e.g Amanda
vs. Bronwen, Amanda vs. Bruce, etc.).

As expected, intra speaker variability is lower than inter-
speaker variability but we remark that there is not big differ-
ences between intra speaker variability of a real voice (William)
and the intra speaker variability of a synthetic voice (Amanda
for instance).
Inter speaker variability is slightly greater be-
tween the real human voice (William) and the other synthetic
voices, but inter speaker variability between synthetic voices
is still high, meaning our synthetic corpus should be difﬁcult
enough for tasks such as unsupervised term discovery (UTD)
accross a collection of speech utterances from multiple speak-
ers. This is what we intend to show in a preliminary experiment,
in the next subsection.

clusters also seem to be purer than the global clusters since the
within-speaker precision for the grouping task is higher than
the global precision. Grouping recall indicates that speech seg-
ments which should have been in the same clusters have been
assigned to different clusters. Finally, the low coverage and
matching recall clearly indicate that a lot of work has to be done
in order to get the most out of the available data and that SDTW
alone might not be enough to fully segment speech utterances.
For instance, modeling prosodic features could be of great help.
To summarize, this experiment with an off-the-shelf toolkit,
shows that our synthetic corpus of spoken captions is difﬁcult
enough for UTD task.

Table 2 shows examples of clusters found by the UTD sys-
tem along with the corresponding images of MSCOCO. As
shown in Table 1, segments rarely match single tokens. How-
ever, Table 2 shows that they often match frequent n-grams (”a
man riding”, ”ﬁre hydrant” and ”skiing down”) and multiword
expressions (MWE) such as ”a bunch of bananas”. As such,
adding a new metric to TDE that would assess the quality of
the segmentation according to gold chunks and MWE would be
interesting.

5. Japanese translations

A further augmentation of MSCOCO was created by [?] where
Japanese captions were collected using the same methodology
as [?]. This corpus comprises 131,740 captions for 26,500 im-
ages. As the augmentation created by [?] does not provided a
Japanese version for all of the captions, we used Machine Trans-
lation (MT)9 to translate all the available English captions to
Japanese. This allows SPEECH-COCO to be used for cross-
modal studies using speech, images, text and translations.

6. Conclusion

In this paper, we have presented SPEECH-COCO, an exten-
sion of the MSCOCO image recognition and captioning dataset,
which consists of more than 604 hours of speech.

spoken captions (subset of 100 speech signals corresponding to
20 images)

4.3. Unsupervised Term Discovery (UTD)

For UTD, we use the Zero Resource Toolkit (ZRTools [17]).
ZRTools uses segmental dynamic time warping (SDTW) to dis-
cover pairs of acoustically similar audio segments, and then
uses graph clustering on overlapping pairs to form a hard clus-
tering of the discovered segments. Replacing each discovered
segment with its unique cluster label, or pseudoterm, gives us a
partial, noisy transcription, or pseudotext.

To evaluate UTD performance, we used the term discovery
evaluation toolkit (TDE) [18]. UTD was done on a subset of
the corpus (10,000 captions which represent approximately 10
hours of speech) and the results are reported in Table 1.

Our results conﬁrm that the UTD task is still difﬁcult even if
our corpus is synthetic: we found very few gold tokens (low pre-
cision and even lower recall8). There is very little difference be-
tween the global precision and the within-speaker precision for
the matching task, suggesting that the clusters mainly consist of
speech segments belonging to the same speaker. Within-speaker

8TDE only gives three signiﬁcant ﬁgures after the decimal point.

Since our results are very low, there were rounded up to 0.000

language processing:

The addition of speech as a new modality enables
SPEECH-COCO to be used in different ﬁelds of research
including language acquisition, visually-grounded word dis-
covery and keyword spotting, and semantic embedding using
speech and vision.

This corpus has been used during the Jelinek Memorial
Workshop on Speech and Language Technology (JSALT) 2017
jointly organized by CMU and JHU (Speaking Rosetta Stone
team on discovering grounded linguistic units for languages
without orthography).

We list below a list of topics that are as many LaVi tasks

possible with SPEECH-COCO:

• spoken caption generation from images (generating

speech from images),

• visually-grounded spoken term discovery,

• cross-modal speech-image-text studies,

• image generation from speech input,

• simulating language documentation tasks where speech

has been elicited from images,

• effect of visual context on computational language ac-

quisition,

• (spoken) visual question answering,

• data augmentation by adding synthetic multi-modal data

to more naturalistic (but small) corpora.

Abstract

This paper presents an augmentation of MSCOCO dataset
where speech is added to image and text. Speech captions
are generated using text-to-speech (TTS) synthesis resulting in
616,767 spoken captions (more than 600h) paired with images.
Disﬂuencies and speed perturbation are added to the signal in
order to sound more natural. Each speech signal (WAV) is
paired with a JSON ﬁle containing exact timecode for each
word/syllable/phoneme in the spoken caption. Such a corpus
could be used for Language and Vision (LaVi) tasks including
speech input or output instead of text. Investigating multimodal
learning schemes for unsupervised speech pattern discovery is
also possible with this corpus, as demonstrated by a preliminary
study conducted on a subset of the corpus (10h, 10k spoken cap-
tions).

1. Introduction

During the past few years, there has been an increasing interest
in research gathering language and vision (LaVi) communities.
This trend can be explained by the availability of multimodal
corpora such as Flickr30k [1] or MSCOCO [2], containing im-
ages and their captions in natural language text. LaVi systems
also have beneﬁted from the introduction of neural encoder-
decoder approaches [3, 4] that allow text to be generated from
images or speech (or vice-versa), or to learn joint embeddings
of images and text [5].

After the pioneering work done at MIT 15 years ago [6],
these recent advances have also fueled fundamental research in
(grounded) language acquisition and understanding (linguistics,
cognitive science, autonomous robotics) as well as in more ap-
plied research to solve tasks such as image captioning [7] or
visual question answering [8].

While many benchmark image datasets have been designed
to assess the quality of machine-generated image descriptions
(for a survey see [7]), speech modality has been less focused
on, probably because of the lack of large corpora for conduct-
ing such studies. In fact, except the augmentation of Flickr8k
dataset (by collecting a corpus of 40,000 spoken captions using
Amazon Mechanical Turk - AMT) proposed by [9] which lead
to the following research papers [10, 11], very few researches
on spoken language and vision were conducted so far.

Paper contributions.
This paper proposes a dataset that is an order of magnitude
bigger than what is already available (600k spoken captions in-
stead of 40k in [9]). Our dataset is built on top of MSCOCO
[2] and contains more than 600,000 spoken captions (we will
refer to it as SPEECH-COCO in the rest of this paper). We be-
lieve that this corpus may be useful for further Language and

Vision (LaVi) tasks including speech input or output instead of
text. The data set is made available online1. Moreover, speech
data is perfectly annotated (does not rely on error-prone forced
alignment) since the annotations are produced during the TTS
process itself (at word, syllable and phone level).

Paper outline.

This paper is organized as following.

In section 2, we
quickly review existing corpora usable for visually grounded
language acquisition and motivates the choice of MSCOCO as
a starting point. In section 3, we present our general method-
ology and describe the spoken caption generation itself while
section 4 presents some analysis on SPEECH-COCO as well as
its ﬁrst use for an unsupervised word discovery task. Finally,
section 5 concludes this work and gives some perspectives.

2. Existing Corpora of Visually Grounded
Speech

Flickr30K [1] (an extension of Flickr8K [12]) and MSCOCO
[2] are now widely used in LaVi community. We can also men-
tion the Visual Genome dataset, an ongoing effort to connect
structured image concepts to language [13]. For a broader sur-
vey on image captioning datasets, the reader may refer to [7].

Flickr8K and Flickr30K contain images from Flickr with
approximately 8,000 and 30,000 images, respectively. The im-
ages in these two datasets were selected through user queries
for speciﬁc objects and actions. Both contain ﬁve descriptions
per image which were collected using a crowdsourcing platform
(AMT).

The MSCOCO dataset currently consists of 123,287 im-
ages with ﬁve different descriptions per image. Images in this
dataset are annotated for 80 object categories and bounding
boxes around all instances in one of these categories are avail-
able for all images. The MSCOCO dataset has been widely
used for automatic image captioning. Several extensions of
MSCOCO are currently under development, including the ad-
dition of questions&answers for Visual Question Answering
(VQA) task2 or FOIL-COCO (Find One mismatch between Im-
age and Language caption) which consists of images associated
with incorrect captions to challenge existing LaVi models3.

Concerning spoken captions, AMT recordings were ob-
tained from Flickr8K by [9] but only 40k captions are made
available online4. In addition, time-coded annotations are ob-

(error-prone) automatic forced-alignment. Very recently, spo-
ken captions for MSCOCO were generated using Google TTS
by [14]. However, only one TTS voice was used limiting the
speaker variability.

3. SPEECH-COCO: Adding Spoken
Captions to MSCOCO

3.1. Our Starting Point: MSCOCO

We used Microsoft’s Common Objects in Context (MSCOCO)
[2] training and validation datasets as our starting point.
In
MSCOCO, each image is described by at least ﬁve descriptions
written by humans. The images contain 91 common object cat-
egories (e.g. dog, elephant, bird, car, bicycle, air plane, etc.)
from 11 super-categories (Animal, Vehicle, etc.), with 82 of
them having more than 5K labelled instances. In total there are
123,287 images with captions (82,783 for training and 40,504
for validation). The test set is not available for download since
it is used on an evaluation server for continuous benchmarking
of image captioning systems. Consequently, 616,767 captions
from 123,287 images are available for download.

3.2. Spoken Captions Generation

Synthetic speech was generated for each caption using Voxy-
gen5, a commercial speech synthesis system, for 4 different UK
voices (Paul, Elizabeth, Judith and Bronwen) and 4 different
It is important
US voices (Phil, Bruce, Amanda and Jenny).
to note that this is corpus-based concatenative speech synthesis
[15] and not parametric synthesis. So, for each speaker’s voice,
speech utterances are generated by concatenation of units mined
from a large speech corpus (generally around 3000 sentences/s-
peaker). This means that despite having little intra-speaker vari-
ability in our speech data, there is a realistic level of inter-
speaker variability, as opposed to the small corpus proposed in
[14].

On average, each caption comprises 10.79 tokens. The

WAV ﬁles are on average 3.52 second long.

3.3. Adding Variability

First, we applied speed perturbation on the spoken captions to
introduce intra-speaker variability in the dataset. For this, we
used the tempo function of Sox6 audio manipulation tool. This
simple processing only changes speech rate while trying to keep
the same pitch and spectral enveloppe. Our recordings were
either accelerated (speed x 1.1), slowed down (speed x 0.9) or
kept unchanged with equal probability of event.

Second, we added disﬂuencies to some of the captions so
that they would sound more natural. We chose to only include
ﬁllers (such as ”um”, ”uh”, ”er”, ”huh”, ”oh” and ”ah”). It was
shown that ﬁllers often occur when speakers have to face an
heavy processing load (when describing an image for example)
and that they also act as coordinators [16]. Thus, adding ﬁllers
to some captions is legitimate and makes the corpus more re-
alistic. The probability of adding a ﬁller to any given caption
was set to 0.3. The ﬁllers were either added at the beginning, at
the end or in the middle of a caption with equal probability of
event.

4. Spoken Corpus Analysis

4.1. Metadata and scripts

We adopted the following naming convention for both the WAV
and JSON ﬁles:

imageID captionID Speaker DisﬂuencyPosition Speed

Each WAV ﬁle is paired with a JSON ﬁle containing various
information: timecode of each word in the caption, name of the
speaker, name of the WAV ﬁle, etc. The JSON ﬁles have the
following data structure:
{

"duration": float,
"speaker": string,
"synthesisedCaption": string,
"timecode": list,
"speed": float,
"wavFilename": string,
"captionID": int,
"imgID": int,
"disfluency": list

}

We also created a Python script7 which handles the meta-
data, so that the user can easily make use of the corpus. The
script has the following features:

• Aggregate all the information in the JSON ﬁles into a

single SQLite database

• Find captions according to speciﬁc ﬁlters (name, gender
and nationality of the speaker, disﬂuency position, speed,
duration, and words in the caption). The script automati-
cally builds the SQLite query. The user can also provide
his own SQLite query.

• Find all the captions belonging to a speciﬁc image
• Parse the timecodes and have them structured
• Get the words, syllables and phonemes timecodes
• Convert the timecodes to Praat TextGrid ﬁles (see Figure

1)

4.2. Analysis of intra and inter speaker variability

To be sure that our corpus is realistic enough, we computed in-
ter and intra speaker variability measures on a subset of 100
captions corresponding to 20 images and added 2 additional
voices to our 8 synthetic voices for these captions: a real voice
(William) and Google TTS (gTTS). We then extracted words
that were repeated across sentences and analyzed their intra and
inter speaker variability using Dynamic Time Warping (DTW)
computed for all occurrences of the same word by the same
speaker (e.g. Amanda vs Amanda) and for all the occurrences of
the same word pronounced by different speakers (e.g Amanda
vs. Bronwen, Amanda vs. Bruce, etc.).

As expected, intra speaker variability is lower than inter-
speaker variability but we remark that there is not big differ-
ences between intra speaker variability of a real voice (William)
and the intra speaker variability of a synthetic voice (Amanda
for instance).
Inter speaker variability is slightly greater be-
tween the real human voice (William) and the other synthetic
voices, but inter speaker variability between synthetic voices
is still high, meaning our synthetic corpus should be difﬁcult
enough for tasks such as unsupervised term discovery (UTD)
accross a collection of speech utterances from multiple speak-
ers. This is what we intend to show in a preliminary experiment,
in the next subsection.

clusters also seem to be purer than the global clusters since the
within-speaker precision for the grouping task is higher than
the global precision. Grouping recall indicates that speech seg-
ments which should have been in the same clusters have been
assigned to different clusters. Finally, the low coverage and
matching recall clearly indicate that a lot of work has to be done
in order to get the most out of the available data and that SDTW
alone might not be enough to fully segment speech utterances.
For instance, modeling prosodic features could be of great help.
To summarize, this experiment with an off-the-shelf toolkit,
shows that our synthetic corpus of spoken captions is difﬁcult
enough for UTD task.

Table 2 shows examples of clusters found by the UTD sys-
tem along with the corresponding images of MSCOCO. As
shown in Table 1, segments rarely match single tokens. How-
ever, Table 2 shows that they often match frequent n-grams (”a
man riding”, ”ﬁre hydrant” and ”skiing down”) and multiword
expressions (MWE) such as ”a bunch of bananas”. As such,
adding a new metric to TDE that would assess the quality of
the segmentation according to gold chunks and MWE would be
interesting.

5. Japanese translations

A further augmentation of MSCOCO was created by [?] where
Japanese captions were collected using the same methodology
as [?]. This corpus comprises 131,740 captions for 26,500 im-
ages. As the augmentation created by [?] does not provided a
Japanese version for all of the captions, we used Machine Trans-
lation (MT)9 to translate all the available English captions to
Japanese. This allows SPEECH-COCO to be used for cross-
modal studies using speech, images, text and translations.

6. Conclusion

In this paper, we have presented SPEECH-COCO, an exten-
sion of the MSCOCO image recognition and captioning dataset,
which consists of more than 604 hours of speech.

spoken captions (subset of 100 speech signals corresponding to
20 images)

4.3. Unsupervised Term Discovery (UTD)

For UTD, we use the Zero Resource Toolkit (ZRTools [17]).
ZRTools uses segmental dynamic time warping (SDTW) to dis-
cover pairs of acoustically similar audio segments, and then
uses graph clustering on overlapping pairs to form a hard clus-
tering of the discovered segments. Replacing each discovered
segment with its unique cluster label, or pseudoterm, gives us a
partial, noisy transcription, or pseudotext.

To evaluate UTD performance, we used the term discovery
evaluation toolkit (TDE) [18]. UTD was done on a subset of
the corpus (10,000 captions which represent approximately 10
hours of speech) and the results are reported in Table 1.

Our results conﬁrm that the UTD task is still difﬁcult even if
our corpus is synthetic: we found very few gold tokens (low pre-
cision and even lower recall8). There is very little difference be-
tween the global precision and the within-speaker precision for
the matching task, suggesting that the clusters mainly consist of
speech segments belonging to the same speaker. Within-speaker

8TDE only gives three signiﬁcant ﬁgures after the decimal point.

Since our results are very low, there were rounded up to 0.000

The addition of speech as a new modality enables
SPEECH-COCO to be used in different ﬁelds of research
including language acquisition, visually-grounded word dis-

• spoken caption generation from images (generating

speech from images),

• visually-grounded spoken term discovery,

• cross-modal speech-image-text studies,

• image generation from speech input,

• simulating language documentation tasks where speech

has been elicited from images,

• effect of visual context on computational language ac-

quisition,

• (spoken) visual question answering,

• data augmentation by adding synthetic multi-modal data

to more naturalistic (but small) corpora.

Abstract

This paper presents an augmentation of MSCOCO dataset
where speech is added to image and text. Speech captions
are generated using text-to-speech (TTS) synthesis resulting in
616,767 spoken captions (more than 600h) paired with images.
Disﬂuencies and speed perturbation are added to the signal in
order to sound more natural. Each speech signal (WAV) is
paired with a JSON ﬁle containing exact timecode for each
word/syllable/phoneme in the spoken caption. Such a corpus
could be used for Language and Vision (LaVi) tasks including
speech input or output instead of text. Investigating multimodal
learning schemes for unsupervised speech pattern discovery is
also possible with this corpus, as demonstrated by a preliminary
study conducted on a subset of the corpus (10h, 10k spoken cap-
tions).

1. Introduction

During the past few years, there has been an increasing interest
in research gathering language and vision (LaVi) communities.
This trend can be explained by the availability of multimodal
corpora such as Flickr30k [1] or MSCOCO [2], containing im-
ages and their captions in natural language text. LaVi systems
also have beneﬁted from the introduction of neural encoder-
decoder approaches [3, 4] that allow text to be generated from
images or speech (or vice-versa), or to learn joint embeddings
of images and text [5].

After the pioneering work done at MIT 15 years ago [6],
these recent advances have also fueled fundamental research in
(grounded) language acquisition and understanding (linguistics,
cognitive science, autonomous robotics) as well as in more ap-
plied research to solve tasks such as image captioning [7] or
visual question answering [8].

While many benchmark image datasets have been designed
to assess the quality of machine-generated image descriptions
(for a survey see [7]), speech modality has been less focused
on, probably because of the lack of large corpora for conduct-
ing such studies. In fact, except the augmentation of Flickr8k
dataset (by collecting a corpus of 40,000 spoken captions using
Amazon Mechanical Turk - AMT) proposed by [9] which lead
to the following research papers [10, 11], very few researches
on spoken language and vision were conducted so far.

Paper contributions.
This paper proposes a dataset that is an order of magnitude
bigger than what is already available (600k spoken captions in-
stead of 40k in [9]). Our dataset is built on top of MSCOCO
[2] and contains more than 600,000 spoken captions (we will
refer to it as SPEECH-COCO in the rest of this paper). We be-
lieve that this corpus may be useful for further Language and

Vision (LaVi) tasks including speech input or output instead of
text. The data set is made available online1. Moreover, speech
data is perfectly annotated (does not rely on error-prone forced
alignment) since the annotations are produced during the TTS
process itself (at word, syllable and phone level).

Paper outline.

This paper is organized as following.

In section 2, we
quickly review existing corpora usable for visually grounded
language acquisition and motivates the choice of MSCOCO as
a starting point. In section 3, we present our general method-
ology and describe the spoken caption generation itself while
section 4 presents some analysis on SPEECH-COCO as well as
its ﬁrst use for an unsupervised word discovery task. Finally,
section 5 concludes this work and gives some perspectives.

2. Existing Corpora of Visually Grounded
Speech

Flickr30K [1] (an extension of Flickr8K [12]) and MSCOCO
[2] are now widely used in LaVi community. We can also men-
tion the Visual Genome dataset, an ongoing effort to connect
structured image concepts to language [13]. For a broader sur-
vey on image captioning datasets, the reader may refer to [7].

Flickr8K and Flickr30K contain images from Flickr with
approximately 8,000 and 30,000 images, respectively. The im-
ages in these two datasets were selected through user queries
for speciﬁc objects and actions. Both contain ﬁve descriptions
per image which were collected using a crowdsourcing platform
(AMT).

The MSCOCO dataset currently consists of 123,287 im-
ages with ﬁve different descriptions per image. Images in this
dataset are annotated for 80 object categories and bounding
boxes around all instances in one of these categories are avail-
able for all images. The MSCOCO dataset has been widely
used for automatic image captioning. Several extensions of
MSCOCO are currently under development, including the ad-
dition of questions&answers for Visual Question Answering
(VQA) task2 or FOIL-COCO (Find One mismatch between Im-
age and Language caption) which consists of images associated
with incorrect captions to challenge existing LaVi models3.

Concerning spoken captions, AMT recordings were ob-
tained from Flickr8K by [9] but only 40k captions are made
available online4. In addition, time-coded annotations are ob-

tained after alignment of speech data with transcripts through
(error-prone) automatic forced-alignment. Very recently, spo-
ken captions for MSCOCO were generated using Google TTS
by [14]. However, only one TTS voice was used limiting the
speaker variability.

3. SPEECH-COCO: Adding Spoken
Captions to MSCOCO

3.1. Our Starting Point: MSCOCO

We used Microsoft’s Common Objects in Context (MSCOCO)
[2] training and validation datasets as our starting point.
In
MSCOCO, each image is described by at least ﬁve descriptions
written by humans. The images contain 91 common object cat-
egories (e.g. dog, elephant, bird, car, bicycle, air plane, etc.)
from 11 super-categories (Animal, Vehicle, etc.), with 82 of
them having more than 5K labelled instances. In total there are
123,287 images with captions (82,783 for training and 40,504
for validation). The test set is not available for download since
it is used on an evaluation server for continuous benchmarking
of image captioning systems. Consequently, 616,767 captions
from 123,287 images are available for download.

3.2. Spoken Captions Generation

Synthetic speech was generated for each caption using Voxy-
gen5, a commercial speech synthesis system, for 4 different UK
voices (Paul, Elizabeth, Judith and Bronwen) and 4 different
It is important
US voices (Phil, Bruce, Amanda and Jenny).
to note that this is corpus-based concatenative speech synthesis
[15] and not parametric synthesis. So, for each speaker’s voice,
speech utterances are generated by concatenation of units mined
from a large speech corpus (generally around 3000 sentences/s-
peaker). This means that despite having little intra-speaker vari-
ability in our speech data, there is a realistic level of inter-
speaker variability, as opposed to the small corpus proposed in
[14].

On average, each caption comprises 10.79 tokens. The

WAV ﬁles are on average 3.52 second long.

3.3. Adding Variability

First, we applied speed perturbation on the spoken captions to
introduce intra-speaker variability in the dataset. For this, we
used the tempo function of Sox6 audio manipulation tool. This
simple processing only changes speech rate while trying to keep
the same pitch and spectral enveloppe. Our recordings were
either accelerated (speed x 1.1), slowed down (speed x 0.9) or
kept unchanged with equal probability of event.

Second, we added disﬂuencies to some of the captions so
that they would sound more natural. We chose to only include
ﬁllers (such as ”um”, ”uh”, ”er”, ”huh”, ”oh” and ”ah”). It was
shown that ﬁllers often occur when speakers have to face an
heavy processing load (when describing an image for example)
and that they also act as coordinators [16]. Thus, adding ﬁllers
to some captions is legitimate and makes the corpus more re-
alistic. The probability of adding a ﬁller to any given caption
was set to 0.3. The ﬁllers were either added at the beginning, at
the end or in the middle of a caption with equal probability of
event.

4. Spoken Corpus Analysis

4.1. Metadata and scripts

We adopted the following naming convention for both the WAV
and JSON ﬁles:

imageID captionID Speaker DisﬂuencyPosition Speed

Each WAV ﬁle is paired with a JSON ﬁle containing various
information: timecode of each word in the caption, name of the
speaker, name of the WAV ﬁle, etc. The JSON ﬁles have the
following data structure:
{

"duration": float,
"speaker": string,
"synthesisedCaption": string,
"timecode": list,
"speed": float,
"wavFilename": string,
"captionID": int,
"imgID": int,
"disfluency": list

}

We also created a Python script7 which handles the meta-
data, so that the user can easily make use of the corpus. The
script has the following features:

• Aggregate all the information in the JSON ﬁles into a

single SQLite database

• Find captions according to speciﬁc ﬁlters (name, gender
and nationality of the speaker, disﬂuency position, speed,
duration, and words in the caption). The script automati-
cally builds the SQLite query. The user can also provide
his own SQLite query.

• Find all the captions belonging to a speciﬁc image
• Parse the timecodes and have them structured
• Get the words, syllables and phonemes timecodes
• Convert the timecodes to Praat TextGrid ﬁles (see Figure

1)

4.2. Analysis of intra and inter speaker variability

To be sure that our corpus is realistic enough, we computed in-
ter and intra speaker variability measures on a subset of 100
captions corresponding to 20 images and added 2 additional
voices to our 8 synthetic voices for these captions: a real voice
(William) and Google TTS (gTTS). We then extracted words
that were repeated across sentences and analyzed their intra and
inter speaker variability using Dynamic Time Warping (DTW)
computed for all occurrences of the same word by the same
speaker (e.g. Amanda vs Amanda) and for all the occurrences of
the same word pronounced by different speakers (e.g Amanda
vs. Bronwen, Amanda vs. Bruce, etc.).

As expected, intra speaker variability is lower than inter-
speaker variability but we remark that there is not big differ-
ences between intra speaker variability of a real voice (William)
and the intra speaker variability of a synthetic voice (Amanda
for instance).
Inter speaker variability is slightly greater be-
tween the real human voice (William) and the other synthetic
voices, but inter speaker variability between synthetic voices
is still high, meaning our synthetic corpus should be difﬁcult
enough for tasks such as unsupervised term discovery (UTD)
accross a collection of speech utterances from multiple speak-
ers. This is what we intend to show in a preliminary experiment,
in the next subsection.

clusters also seem to be purer than the global clusters since the
within-speaker precision for the grouping task is higher than
the global precision. Grouping recall indicates that speech seg-
ments which should have been in the same clusters have been
assigned to different clusters. Finally, the low coverage and
matching recall clearly indicate that a lot of work has to be done
in order to get the most out of the available data and that SDTW
alone might not be enough to fully segment speech utterances.
For instance, modeling prosodic features could be of great help.
To summarize, this experiment with an off-the-shelf toolkit,
shows that our synthetic corpus of spoken captions is difﬁcult
enough for UTD task.

Table 2 shows examples of clusters found by the UTD sys-
tem along with the corresponding images of MSCOCO. As
shown in Table 1, segments rarely match single tokens. How-
ever, Table 2 shows that they often match frequent n-grams (”a
man riding”, ”ﬁre hydrant” and ”skiing down”) and multiword
expressions (MWE) such as ”a bunch of bananas”. As such,
adding a new metric to TDE that would assess the quality of
the segmentation according to gold chunks and MWE would be
interesting.

5. Japanese translations

A further augmentation of MSCOCO was created by [?] where
Japanese captions were collected using the same methodology
as [?]. This corpus comprises 131,740 captions for 26,500 im-
ages. As the augmentation created by [?] does not provided a
Japanese version for all of the captions, we used Machine Trans-
lation (MT)9 to translate all the available English captions to
Japanese. This allows SPEECH-COCO to be used for cross-
modal studies using speech, images, text and translations.

6. Conclusion

In this paper, we have presented SPEECH-COCO, an exten-
sion of the MSCOCO image recognition and captioning dataset,
which consists of more than 604 hours of speech.

spoken captions (subset of 100 speech signals corresponding to
20 images)

4.3. Unsupervised Term Discovery (UTD)

For UTD, we use the Zero Resource Toolkit (ZRTools [17]).
ZRTools uses segmental dynamic time warping (SDTW) to dis-
cover pairs of acoustically similar audio segments, and then
uses graph clustering on overlapping pairs to form a hard clus-
tering of the discovered segments. Replacing each discovered
segment with its unique cluster label, or pseudoterm, gives us a
partial, noisy transcription, or pseudotext.

To evaluate UTD performance, we used the term discovery
evaluation toolkit (TDE) [18]. UTD was done on a subset of
the corpus (10,000 captions which represent approximately 10
hours of speech) and the results are reported in Table 1.

Our results conﬁrm that the UTD task is still difﬁcult even if
our corpus is synthetic: we found very few gold tokens (low pre-
cision and even lower recall8). There is very little difference be-
tween the global precision and the within-speaker precision for
the matching task, suggesting that the clusters mainly consist of
speech segments belonging to the same speaker. Within-speaker

8TDE only gives three signiﬁcant ﬁgures after the decimal point.

Since our results are very low, there were rounded up to 0.000

language processing:

The addition of speech as a new modality enables
SPEECH-COCO to be used in different ﬁelds of research
including language acquisition, visually-grounded word dis-
covery and keyword spotting, and semantic embedding using
speech and vision.

This corpus has been used during the Jelinek Memorial
Workshop on Speech and Language Technology (JSALT) 2017
jointly organized by CMU and JHU (Speaking Rosetta Stone
team on discovering grounded linguistic units for languages
without orthography).

We list below a list of topics that are as many LaVi tasks

possible with SPEECH-COCO:

• spoken caption generation from images (generating

speech from images),

• visually-grounded spoken term discovery,

• cross-modal speech-image-text studies,

• image generation from speech input,

• simulating language documentation tasks where speech

has been elicited from images,

• effect of visual context on computational language ac-

quisition,

• (spoken) visual question answering,

• data augmentation by adding synthetic multi-modal data

to more naturalistic (but small) corpora.
