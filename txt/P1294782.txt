Abstract

Recognizing attributes of objects and their parts is im-
portant to many computer vision applications. Although
great progress has been made to apply object-level recog-
nition, recognizing the attributes of parts remains less ap-
plicable since the training data for part attributes recog-
nition is usually scarce especially for internet-scale appli-
cations. Furthermore, most existing part attribute recog-
nition methods rely on the part annotation which is more
expensive to obtain. To solve the data insufﬁciency prob-
lem and get rid of dependence on the part annotation, we
introduce a novel Concept Sharing Network (CSN) for part
attribute recognition. A great advantage of CSN is its ca-
pability of recognizing the part attribute (a combination
of part location and appearance pattern) that has insufﬁ-
cient or zero training data, by learning the part location
and appearance pattern respectively from the training data
that usually mix them in a single label. Extensive exper-
iments on CUB-200-2011 [51], CelebA [35] and a newly
proposed human attribute dataset demonstrate the effective-
ness of CSN and its advantages over other methods, espe-
cially for the attributes with few training samples. Fur-
ther experiments show that CSN can also perform zero-shot
part attribute recognition. The code will be made avail-
able at https://github.com/Zhaoxiangyun/Concept-Sharing-
Network.

1. Introduction

The computer vision community has seen tremendous
progress in recognizing global features of objects, such as
performing category detection [44, 15, 43, 68] and classiﬁ-
cation [24] (e.g. detect the bounding box and classify the
category of a bird from an image). Meanwhile, recognizing
attributes of object parts (e.g.
localize the wing of a bird
and classify its biologic feature) is still a very challenging
problem due to multiple issues. First, attributes (e.g.
the
color of the wing of a bird ) normally attach to a very lim-

Figure 1. In many datasets and real applications, the labeling of
part attributes is usually very limited. For example, as this ﬁgure
shows, in CUB-200-2011 [51] dataset the labels of breast spotted
is very few, whereas the number of the labels of wing spotted, wing
white, and breast black are more but still limited. We propose to
identify the relationships between different labels based on their
locations and patterns, so as to re-use the labels of other attributes
to facilitate the recognition of the attribute that lacks labels (e.g.
breast spotted in this ﬁgure). Further, we ﬁnd that the recognition
of all these attributes can be jointly improved if individual con-
cepts of different attributes can be shared.

ited area of an object, which are usually more difﬁcult to be
accurately localized from an image compared to the over-
all object. Most existing part attribute recognition meth-
ods [64, 30, 62] train a part detector with large extra anno-
tations to detect the relevant part. However, such part anno-
tations are very expensive to obtain. Therefore, these meth-
ods generally fail when the part annotation is not available.
How to recognize the part attribute with only image-level
annotation is still under-explored.

Another important problem is that the training data is
expensive to obtain and usually insufﬁcient in the existing
dataset. For example, in a commonly used bird parts at-
tribute recognition dataset CUB-200-2011 [51], the number
of training images for most attributes varies from merely

In this work, we also contribute a large-scale human at-
tribute dataset, named as SurveilA, which contains 75,000
images with 10 carefully annotated attributes focusing on
the ﬁne-grained human activities for video surveillance.
The human images are collected in the wild under different
scenes, scales, poses and viewpoint variations. The dataset
is challenging as shown in the experiments that simply ﬁne-
tuning standard networks cannot provide accurate enough
estimation, and recognition would require a model to focus
on local discriminative parts.

Overall, our work has the following contributions: 1) We
aim at addressing the data insufﬁciency problem in part at-
tribute recognition, which is rarely discussed in previous
work. 2) We present an effective part attribute recognition
framework which does not depend on the part annotation.
3) Our network is proven to be effective in zero-shot part
attribute recognition. 4) We will release a new dataset for
part attribute recognition, which consists of 75000 images
of human in a real-world scenario with 10 attributes anno-
tation.

2. Related Work

Attribute Recognition Attribute Recognition was ﬁrst
introduced as a computer vision problem in [12]. From
then, attribute recognition have been studied extensively
with numerous datasets and methods [11, 10, 26, 25, 27, 28,
55, 67]. Part Attribute recognition is a harder problem be-
cause it is only attached to a very limited area of an object.
State of the art methods [5, 64, 30] usually rely on the part
location annotations to train part detectors such as Pose-
lets [5], Deformable Part Models [63] or R-CNN [16] to
ﬁrst localize parts then extract visual features to recognize
attributes [22]. But the part annotation is very expensive to
obtain. Although, recently some methods [57, 21, 69] are
proposed to localize the important regions for recognition,
they are not carefully designed for part attribute recognition
and do not attempt to address the data insufﬁciency prob-
lem. [14, 32] used attribute recognition results to facilitate
the ﬁne-grained recognition, but both of them will fail when
training data is insufﬁcient.

Few-shot / Zero-shot Learning Besides collecting more
data, few-shot learning [50] and zero-shot learning [39] at-
tempt to directly address the data insufﬁciency problem -
predicting novel concepts that were either very few or com-
pletely unseen from the training set. These problems are
classical because almost all in-the-wild data follow a heavy-
tail distribution [19] with new classes appearing frequently
after the training and no ﬁnite set of samples can cover the
diversity of the real world. Recently, few-shot learning is
modeled as a meta learning problem [42, 13] through ex-
plicitly building training loss to enforce adaptation to new
categories with few examples. On the other hand, due to
the complete lack of training data, zero-shot models at-

Figure 2. Overview of the training. Training images of differ-
ent attributes are forwarded through the CNN to obtain the image
representation, then attribute samples with the same part are for-
warded through the same localization module and attribute sam-
ples with the same appearance pattern are forwarded through the
same pattern recognition module. New attribute with no training
data could be recognized as the combination of the learned mod-
ules.

a few dozens to at most a few hundred. Most existing at-
tribute recognition methods (if not all) process each part at-
tribute independently, and ignore the spatial correlation of
different part attributes. As a result, their performance is
simply limited by the volume of training data of each iso-
lated attribute. How to solve the data insufﬁciency problem
is rarely discussed.

To address these challenges, we propose a novel Con-
cept Sharing Network (CSN) for part attribute recognition.
In CSN, the part attribute is deﬁned as the combination of
two concepts: part location and appearance pattern, as il-
lustrated in Fig. 1. Our neural network models the two con-
cepts as two modules, in contrast to individually modeling
each attribute in different branches. Since the two mod-
ules in CSN could be shared among different attributes, the
labeling of attributes (e.g. color and shape) belong to cer-
tain parts (e.g. wing) of an object can be used to facilitate
the training of another attribute of the same parts, and vice
versa. In such a manner, we maximize the usage of the pre-
cious training data to boost the attribute recognition perfor-
mance independently and aggregately. Note that CSN only
needs image-level attributes labels to train, so it would be
more general than existing part attribute recognition meth-
ods [64, 30, 62] which depend on the part location annota-
tion.

Furthermore, CSN can be used to discover new at-
tributes, i.e. zero-shot part attribute recognition. Given a
training set with certain attributes, the training result of part
localization and pattern recognition in CSN could be used to
recognize a new attribute that does not belong to the training
set. As illustrated in Fig. 2, after the wing location and color
(red) pattern are learned, a new attribute wing red could be
recognized even though the training data of such attribute
does not exist.

tempt to learn to transfer knowledge from other external
sources [1, 45, 7, 52, 65, 31, 58]. In contrast to these works,
we make use of the visual attention mechanism to disen-
tangle part location with appearance features and share the
disentangled representations between attributes, which en-
able us to conduct zero-shot or few-shot generalization on
novel attributes.

Visual Attention and Visual Question Answering Vi-
sual attention models [38, 4] have been widely used in ob-
ject recognition [69, 53], ﬁne-grained recognition [47, 33],
image captioning [60] and visual question answering [8].
These models also decompose the location and appearance
during representation, but do not focus on addressing the
data insufﬁciency problem. CSN improves the visual at-
tention models on data efﬁciency by sharing the attention
mechanism across multiple attribute labels.

The attention region and feature sharing depend on at-
tribute labels, which is similar to visual question answering
(VQA) [3]. In VQA, existing methods [2, 37] also try to
localize the relevant region according to the given question.
But in VQA, all Q/A pairs use the same classiﬁer (i.e. shar-
ing image and language feature extraction, sharing answer
classiﬁer). In contrast, recognition of multiple attributes are
usually considered as a multi-task problem with different
classiﬁers to be trained. It is very expensive to collect suf-
ﬁcient data so as to well train each classiﬁer, especially in
large-scale recognition. This poses a special challenge of
data insufﬁciency, which is the focus of our method.

Attribute Dataset There are some attribute recognition
datasets existing, from general objects and scenes [11, 27,
10, 46, 40, 28, 41, 66] to speciﬁc ﬁne-grained classes such
as faces [20, 26, 25, 35], birds [51], cars [61], clothes [34]
or even butterﬂies [54]. Due to the importance of human
attribute recognition [17, 5, 48, 70, 9, 64, 49, 29, 30] in real
world applications and challenges, we propose a large scale
challenging dataset for human part attribute recognition.

3. Concept Sharing Network

Part attribute recognition aims to predict whether or not
the statement of the attribute of a part is true, e.g. whether
or not ’the wing of the bird is black’ or ’the bill of the bird
is red’. In this work, we introduce a novel Concept Sharing
Network(CSN) for part attribute recognition, as illustrated
in Fig. 3. In CSN, each attribute is deﬁned as a combination
of two concepts: part localization and pattern recognition.

3.1. Network

In CSN, attributes are recognized based on two modules:
the part localization module and the appearance pattern
recognition module. In our training process, as illustrated in
Fig. 2, training images of different attributes are forwarded
through the CNN to obtain the image representation, then
attribute samples with the same part are forwarded through

the same localization module and attribute samples with the
same appearance pattern are forwarded through the same
pattern recognition module. The modules are learned by
the training samples which are forwarded through them. In
the inference process, as illustrated in Fig. 3, given an im-
age and recognizing attribute Pi,j corresponding to part i
and appearance pattern j, the image is forwarded through
the corresponding location module and pattern module to
obtain the ﬁnal prediction.

3.1.1 Part Localization module

One novelty of our work is the employment of attention
mechanism within CSN neural network to localize the part
for attributes. We propose an attention based method
inspired by CAM [69]. Note that many other alterna-
tives [53, 56] can also be incorporated with our framework.
Given an image x, we use the stack of CNN to extract fea-
tures at different location over the image. The output of the
CNNs at a particular layer is Q(x; Θ) ∈ Rhw×d where h
and w are the spatial height and width respectively, d is the
number of channels and Θ is the parameters of the CNN
adopted. For a speciﬁc part, we maintain a learnable vec-
tor Vi ∈ Rd×1 which is called part representation to en-
code the associated part. We expect the inner-product value
between Vi and features in the feature map Q(X; Θ) be-
ing high in associated regions, while the value being low at
other places. As shown in Fig. 3, the localization module
takes image representation Q and location representation Vi
as input and outputs the inner-product map Ai:

Ai(x; Vi, Θ) = Ai(Q; Vi) = Q(x; Θ)Vi

T .

(1)

We then normalize Ai over spatial domain by the soft-max
operation to derive the attention map as

A(cid:48)

i = s(Ai).

(2)

(3)

where s is spatial Softmax function. The attention map is
broadcasted over channels and the results are then multi-
plied back to the feature map resulting an attention weighted
feature map Q(cid:48)
i:

Q(cid:48)

i = Q(x; Θ)T ⊗ A(cid:48)
i.

where ⊗ is the operation of broadcasted multiplication.
Note that, the attention weighted feature maps Q(cid:48)
i are dif-
ferent for different i, though the input feature map Q is
the same, which render output features to focus on differ-
ent spatial location.

3.1.2 Pattern Recognition Module

Conventional attribute recognition methods usually adopt
an average pool followed by a fully-connected layer and a

corresponding location module i and pattern module j to obtain the ﬁnal prediction.

soft-max layer to produce ﬁnal probability of an attribute.
In contrast, our method learns an attention map for each
attribute to weight the feature map so that the following ap-
pearance pattern could be learned by aggregating all train-
ing data of different part locations. Speciﬁcally, for each ap-
pearance pattern j which is annotated a binary classiﬁer la-
bel in part attribute recognition, the probability of predicted
label is calculated as,

f (x; Θ, Vi, W T

j ) = sof tmax(W T

i over spatial domain, and Wj ∈ Rd×2 are appearance

3.2. Concept Sharing Training

In this part, we describe the concept sharing training pro-
cess. We denote an attribute by Pi,j where the part location
index is denoted by i and the pattern indexed is denoted
by j. The attribute recognition model has parameters Θ,
Vi, and Wj to optimize. We denote the training images for
attribute Pi,j as Xij = x0, x1, ..., xNij −1 whose labels are
Yij = y0, y1, ..., yNij −1 where Nij denotes the total number
of training samples for the attribute Pi,j. The Θ, Vi, Wj are
trained by an end-to-end fashion using cross-entropy loss
at ﬁnal binary outputs of recognition modules. The overall
loss is:

L =

L(f (xi; Θ, Vi, W T

j ), yi).

(5)

N −1
(cid:88)

i=0

Where L is the cross-entropy loss and N is the total num-
ber of training samples satisfying: N = (cid:80)
i,j Nij. All at-
tributes in Eq. 5 share the same Θ which are used to extract
the CNN features. In our concept sharing training, the local-
ization module is learned from all training samples sharing
the same part, and the pattern recognition module is learned
from all training samples which sharing the same pattern.
Consequently, the weights of sharing models Vi and Wj are

updated by:

It is worthwhile to mention that, if the attributes are treated
to be independent as in conventional recognition frame-
works, training Vi and Wj will only involve training sam-
ples (Xij, Yij). Since the number of training samples of
a single attribute is usually small in practice, and therefore
the performance of conventional recognition frameworks is
limited by the insufﬁciency of training samples for each iso-
lated attribute. In contrast, the number of training samples
for a particular module would be enlarged in our conceptual
sharing framework i.e. (cid:80)
k Nkj for the pattern recognition,
and (cid:80)
k Nik for part localization. The training data expan-
sion improves the learning sufﬁciency with the limited data.

3.3. New Attribute Recognition

In large-scale applications where the number of at-
tributes is large, it is almost infeasible to obtain reasonable
amount of qualiﬁed training data for every attribute. In this
part, we explain how CSN can be used to recognize a new
attribute without requiring any training samples. As we
discussed above, the localization and recognition module
are shared among different attributes, one speciﬁc combina-
tion of localization and recognition modules determines the
recognition for one speciﬁc attribute, such as the attribute
breast spotted in Fig. 1. Notice that we do not have any
training data for breast spotted. However, we can still train
breast localization module and spotted pattern module from
other attributes. Therefore, by combining the learned loca-
tion forehead and pattern spotted, forehead spotted could be

understandably recognized without any such training data.
Speciﬁcally, attribute Pi,j recognition model is determined
by its parameters Θ, Wj and Vi. Since Wj could be learned
from attributes Pα,j(α (cid:54)= i), and Vi could be learned from
attributes Pi,β(β (cid:54)= j), attribute Pi,j recognition model
could be determined even without any Pi,j data.

4. Experiments

We conduct experiments on three attribute recognition
datasets including CUB-200-2011 [51], CelebA [35] and
our new SurveilA dataset. Since the positive and nega-
tive samples are highly imbalanced in CUB-200-2011 and
SurveilA, we use average precision as our main evaluation
metric.

4.1. Datasets

The CUB-200-2011 dataset [51] contains 11,788 images
of 200 bird categories, where 5994 images are selected for
training and the rest 5794 images for testing. Each image
is annotated with 312 attributes among which 278 are part
related attributes. These part related attributes are all binary
attributes indicating whether a speciﬁc appearance pattern
exists in one particular part such as attribute wing-black tells
whether the wing is black. During experiments,we observe
that the back and tail attributes are nosily labelled. There-
fore, we exclude these labels and conduct experiments on
the remaining 204 attributes. This is the main dataset for
our experimental comparison and ablation study.

CelebA [35] consists of 202,599 face images and 40 bi-
nary face attributes. 16,000 images are selected for training
and 20,000 images for testing and validation.

Our new SurveilA dataset contains 75,000 images with
10 binary attributes, among which 70,000 are selected for
training and the rest 5,000 for testing. The dataset fo-
cuses on human part attribute (e.g. whether carrying an
item, whether wearing shorts or pants), collected under real
surveillance scenarios with large pose and appearance vari-
ations. We will release the dataset to facilitate the research
of attribute recognition.

4.2. Implementation Details

We ﬁrst resize the image to be 512 × 512, then randomly
cropped 446 × 446 for training. We use ResNext50 [59]
as the visual representation module for feature extrac-
tion. The outputs from the layer ‘conv5’ in ResNext50
are used as the feature representation for part localization
i.e. Q in eq. 1.The network is trained for 100 epochs with
ADAM[23] where initial learning rate is set to 0.0001 with
a learning rate decay of 0.1 after 50 epochs.

4.3. Experiments on CUB-200-2011 Dataset

4.3.1 Study the Number of Training Samples

In this part, we empirically study the the effectiveness of
CSN as the number of training samples varies.
In order
to study this, we select attributes belly-solid, breast-white,
bill-grey and bill-black which could share the same part and
have relatively larger positive samples. All experiments are
run on joint training of 91 attributes(i.e. all bill relevant at-
tributes, all grey attributes, all black attributes, all belly, all
breast, all white). We evaluate the performance of the CSN
w/o(without) share, CSN w/part share, CSN w/part + pat-
tern share on the 3 attributes selected. The results are shown
in Tab. 2 and Tab. 1 We see the beneﬁts of sharing attributes
is more obvious when the number of training samples is
small. The pattern features extracted at different location
still varies, forcing them to be the same pattern when they
have relatively large data will harm the performance. But
when the training data size decreases, their own data is in-
sufﬁcient to learn the pattern module. Pattern sharing will
improve the learning efﬁciency of the pattern module.

We also try to decrease the training samples to zero. CSN
still obtains promising results for belly-solid (84.7% AP),
breast-white (79.9% AP), bill-grey (46.3% AP), bill-black
(64.2% AP) that are comparable to the supervised train-
ing. We will further investigate the effectiveness of CSN
for zero-shot recognition in the following section.

4.3.2 Study the Number of Sharing Attributes

In this part, we empirically study the effects of the number
of sharing attributes on the overall performance. In Tab. 5,
we compare sharing different number of attributes in pattern
module and localization module. We select attribute bill-
curved,bill-brown,bill-orange and bill-red. We perform ex-
periments on joint training of all bill attributes, all brown at-
tributes, all orange attributes and all red attributes. We com-

ing attribute number. N1 is the number of sharing part attributes,

available.

with attributes with small number of training images, we se-
lect the attributes with more than 1000 positive images for
a fair comparison. Such selection leads to 32 attributes (e.g.
as white relevant attributes and black relevant attributes) in
the experiments. CSN produces AP of 65.2% compared to
the competitors: 63.2% from CAM, 63.7% from STN and
63.1% of CSN baseline. This illustrates the advantage of
CSN over alternatives given a reasonably large training set.
We investigate all 204 part attributes to further understand
the overall performance of different methods. Fig. 5 shows
the AP difference between of CSN and the baseline on all
204 attributes. Signiﬁcant improvement over the baseline is
observed on average.

We then compare with state-of-the-art attributes recog-
nition methods [64, 62]. We used the public implementa-
tion [64, 6, 62] to train a parts detector(i.e. poselets [6]
and R-CNN [62] ) with part annotation and then recognize
the attributes. Without part annotation, we still obtain com-
parable performance with PANDA [64] and R-CNN based
method [62]. Since they both depend on the part annota-
tions to train the part detector, they fail when the part an-
notation is not available. Furthermore, they both can not be
used for zero shot recognition while ours can.

We also visualize the localization heat map(i.e. the at-
tention map) obtained by CSN w/o share and CSN in Fig.
4. The localization heat map obtained by CSN is obviously
better than that obtained by CSN w/o share. This further
veriﬁes the effectiveness of the concept sharing.

pare the four attributes performance under different number
of sharing part attributes and sharing pattern attributes.

From (a) - (c) in Tab. 5, as the number of sharing part
attributes increases, the overall performance steadily in-
creases. This illustrates that it is more effective when num-
ber of sharing part attributes become larger. Note that as
the number of sharing pattern attributes increases to be 9,
the improvement is observed, this also indicates the sharing
pattern is effective.

4.3.3 Comparison with the State-of-the-art

4.3.4 Soft Sharing among Attributes

We ﬁrst compare with state-of-the-art recognition method
with only image level annotation CAM [69], Spatial Trans-
form Network(STN) [21] and our baseline (a multi task
learning framework with different branches). STN aims at
explicitly localizing important regions for recognition. We
used the public implementation and replace the recognition
by our part attribute recognition. Our CAM implementation
follows [69] (i.e. localize and crop) for recognition. Tab. 3
shows the performance of our method against other meth-
ods. Since the baseline always shows very low performance

In the above section, attributes with the same part are man-
ually grouped to the same part localization module, and at-
tributes with the same pattern are manually grouped to the
same pattern module. Accordingly, attributes with differ-
ent concepts (localization / pattern) can not share the same
module. In this part, we study the soft sharing among parts.
We add a learnable soft weight vector Ti = t1, t2, .., tm
for attribute k, where m is number of parts modules. This
weight vector is used to combine the attention map from
different part. That is

We ﬁrst initialize the vector to be one hot vector(i.e. one
value is 1, others are 0 in Ti). Let the attributes sharing the
same part have the same initialization, and let them learn-
able during the training. This obtains 65.1%(i.e. CSN-soft
in Tab. 3) which is comparable with CSN. We then initial-
ize the vectors as 1(i.e. all values in Ti are initialized as
1). This indicates that we do not have the prior knowledge
which attributes are of the same part. We obtain 63.8%(i.e.
CSN-soft-1 in Tab. 3) which is lower than 65.1% of the pre-
vious one. This indicates that this prior knowledge provide
important information.

4.3.5 Zero-Shot Attribute Recognition

In this part, we study the capability of CSN on zero shot
attribute recognition. The experiments are carried out on all
204 attributes where we randomly select 20 attributes as un-
seen attributes and leave the other 184 attributes for training
the network. In Tab. 8, zero-shot algorithm refers to CSN w/
sharing pattern and part with no training data on the 20 at-
tributes, this is the algorithm for zero shot in Tab. 8, and su-
pervised refers to CSN w/o sharing trained on all available

data. Since the performance gap between zero-shot and su-
pervised is highly relevant to the size of train data, we also
list the number of positive samples in statistics. As shown
in Tab. 8, zero-shot obtains promising results on the con-
dition of zero shot learning. Note that attributes with very
small data, such as ’forehead purple’, ’wing olive’, ’under-
parts green’, zero shot even outperforms results trained on
their own data. For most of attributes, zero shot algorithm is
surprisingly effective as it shows accuracy comparable with
trained on their own data.

4.4. Experiments on CelebA

Our method can also be applied on the general at-
tributes(i.e. global and parts attributes), so we also perform
experiments on a general attributes dataset CelebA [35]. We
follow the protocol in [18]. In table 7, we evaluate the av-
erage accuracy which is usually reported for CelebA. Our
CSN obtains better performance than our baseline and beats
the state of the art methods. This is because all other meth-
ods fail to explicit localize the important regions for recog-
nition. In CSN, we group the parts attributes to share the
same localization module such as nose related and mouth
related. We observe further improvement by sharing the lo-
calization module. This indicates that the concept sharing
is still effective.

Table 6. Average Precision(AP) on our new human attribute test set. The attributes 1-10 are some of the most useful ones in security
surveillance applications: 1 the length of sleeve (short / long), 2 the length of pants (long / short), 3 using a cell phone or not, 4 carrying
an item or not, 5 dragging a luggage or not, 6 smoking or not, 7 wearing a glove or not, 8 holding a baby in arm or not, 9 wearing a mask
or not, 10 holding an umbrella or not. The 2nd row shows the number of the training samples. It can be observed that CSN obtains higher
performance gain for attributes with fewer training samples.

4.5. Experiments on SurveilA Dataset

Tab. 6 shows that in this dataset CSN achieves 51.2%
mAP compared to baseline mAP 30.3%. Such a huge per-
formance improvement is achieved since most of these hu-
man attributes only depend on a small part of the image (e.g.
wearing a mask or not are only related to the face area).
Hence, the localization function of CSN establishes higher
importance than the CUB-200-2011 dataset. In Fig. 7, we
visualize the parts localization obtained by our methods.

Figure 7. Exemplar images of our human dataset. The heat map
placed on the right of each image visualizes the localization infor-
mation predicted in the CSN inference process. We see that most
attributes are only associated with a very small area in images.

The experiments on humans further verify that our proposed
method is effective and reliable for recognizing parts of dif-
ferent types of objects.

5. Conclusion

In this paper, we proposed a new neural network struc-
ture (CSN) for part attribute recognition. By identifying
part locations and appearance patterns from the training
data that do not explicitly label these two concepts, CSN
can increase part attribute recognition accuracy especially
if the number of labels is small. In the special case of data
limitation where none data is available, CSN is still valid
to recognize attributes (i.e. zero-shot part attribute recogni-
tion).
