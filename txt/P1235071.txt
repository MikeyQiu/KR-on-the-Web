Abstract

This paper reports on a reimplementation of a system on detecting implicit positive meaning
from negated statements. In the original regression experiment, different positive interpretations
per negation are scored according to their likelihood. We convert the scores to classes and report
our results on both the regression and classiﬁcation tasks. We show that a baseline taking the
mean score or most frequent class is hard to beat because of class imbalance in the dataset. Our
error analysis indicates that an approach that takes the information structure into account (i.e.
which information is new or contrastive) may be promising, which requires looking beyond the
syntactic and semantic characteristics of negated statements.

Introduction

Modeling inference is one of the most challenging tasks in computational linguistics, yet crucial for
true natural language understanding. It requires looking beyond the literal meaning of statements and
determining what exactly the author intends to convey. The position of focus (the new or contrastive
information) in a sentence, for instance, is one pragmatic phenomenon that can affect its interpretation.
The theory of alternative semantics (Rooth, 1992) assumes that the general function of focus is to evoke
alternatives, i.e. a set of propositions potentially contrasting with the intended meaning of the sentence. A
number of lexical items and constructions have been identiﬁed as focus-sensitive in English, such as only,
even, too, counterfactual conditionals (if ), frequency adverbs (always, sometimes, often) and negation.
Their semantics depend on the information structure of the sentence; different choices of focus can
result in different truth values. For example, Kawamura (2007) illustrates how focus contributes to the
interpretation of negation in Sentence 1 below. In English, focus can be explicitly signaled prosodically,
e.g. in the form of a strong pitch accent, or syntactically, e.g. by moving focused phrases to a special
position in the sentence (Stevens, 2017). If no explicit signal is present, one has to rely on the context to
determine which part of the sentence is in focus and, hence, what is its correct interpretation. This is a
notoriously difﬁcult task that so far has received little attention in the ﬁeld.

This paper reports on a reproduction study for the purpose of understanding the performance of a system
on detecting implicit positive meaning from negated statements. Such a system could support a range of
Natural Language Processing (NLP) technologies that require deep understanding of language, such as
Recognizing Textual Entailment (RTE) and Question Answering (QA). The research that we reproduce

is that of Blanco and Sarabi (2016), who propose an interesting methodology to automatically generate
positive interpretations from negated statements and score them according to their likelihood. We reﬂect
on the deﬁnition of the task and the contribution of the different features to the performance of their
system. Our ﬁndings show that the features they propose are not able to improve upon our baseline
because of class imbalance. Based on an error analysis that we perform on the output of our baseline,
we discuss future lines of research that take levels of informativeness into account, which we expect to
be also applicable to related problems that have to do with implicit meaning and pragmatic phenomena.
The remainder of this paper is structured as follows. In Section 2, we report on related work. Section 3
describes the dataset and the task as created, deﬁned and performed by Blanco and Sarabi (2016). In
Section 4, we report on the replication of the original experiment on our test set and the ablation tests
on feature combinations against the baseline. In Section 5, we redeﬁne the task as a classiﬁcation task
and apply an error analysis to understand system performance against the baseline and the role of the
different features in the classiﬁcation task. Our error analysis leads to a discussion reported in Section 6
and plans for future work. Section 7 summarizes our conclusions.

2 Related Work

The task of scoring implicit positive meanings from negated statements was preceded by the task of de-
tecting the focus of negation. This task was pioneered by Blanco and Moldovan (2011), who argued that
the scope and focus of negation are crucial for a correct interpretation of negated statements. Following
Huddleston and Pullum (2002), they deﬁned scope as “the part of the meaning that is negated” and focus
as “the part of the scope that is most prominently or explicitly negated.” More speciﬁcally, according to
Blanco and Moldovan (2011), the focus of negation gives rise to implicit positive meaning. To capture
this information, they created the PB-FOC corpus, which contains annotations for the focus of negation
in the 3,993 verbal negations in PropBank (Palmer et al., 2005). Candidates for focus annotation were
the verb itself or any of its semantic roles and annotators were instructed to choose only one.

The PB-FOC corpus was used in the ﬁrst edition of the *SEM Shared Task, which was dedicated to
resolving the scope (Task 1) and focus (Task 2) of negation (Morante and Blanco, 2012). Only one team
(Rosenberg and Bergler, 2012) participated in the Focus Detection task. Their system, called CLaCs
NegFocus, is rule-based and consists of three components: the identiﬁcation of explicit negation cues
(not, nor and never), the detection of the syntactic scope of negation, and the detection of the focus of
negation using a set of four syntactic heuristics (e.g. “if an adverb directly precedes the negated verb
and is connected through an advmod dependency relation to the negated verb, this adverb is annotated
as the focus”). They report an F-measure of 0.584. Blanco and Moldovan (2013) report an F-measure
of 0.641 with their system FOC-DET, which is trained with bagging over standard C4.5 decision trees
using a set of features derived from gold syntactic annotation and semantic role labels. Whereas both
CLaCs NegFocus and FOC-DET use only information from within the sentence, Zou et al. (2015) argue
that contextual discourse information plays a critical role in negation focus identiﬁcation and propose a
word-topic graph model that uses this contextual information from both lexical and topical perspectives.
They report an accuracy of 69.39 on PB-FOC.

PB-FOC has given rise to various alternative approaches to the annotation of focus and different deﬁ-
nitions of the corresponding task. Blanco and Moldovan (2012) introduce the concept of granularity of
focus and add ﬁne-grained foci on top of the course-grained foci in PB-FOC; whereas coarse-grained fo-
cus includes all words belonging to a semantic role, ﬁne-grained focus comprises fewer words within the
semantic role (e.g. We didn’t get [an offer for more than $40]FOCUS), allowing for more speciﬁc implicit
positive interpretations (“we got something, but not an offer for more than $40” versus “we got an offer
for $40 or less”). Anand and Martell (2012) evaluated the annotations of PB-FOC, arguing that positive
interpretations resulting from scalar implicatures and neg-raising predicates should be separated from
those (indirectly) resulting from focus, and reannotated the corpus by using an alternative annotation
approach that relies on relevant questions under discussion (QUDs).

Another criticism on PB-FOC was raised by Blanco and Sarabi (2016), who point out that the guide-
lines required the annotators to choose one semantic role as the focus, prioritizing “the one that yields the

most meaningful implicit [positive] information” in case of multiple candidates, but that it is not speciﬁed
what “most meaningful” means. Therefore, they designed a new annotation task where several positive
interpretations per negation (automatically generated by manipulating semantic roles) are scored accord-
ing to their likelihood (see Section 3 for more details). Similar to the distinction between ﬁne-grained and
coarse-grained foci, Sarabi and Blanco (2016) propose to extract and score more ﬁne-grained positive
interpretations by manipulating syntactic dependencies instead of semantic roles. Sanders and Blanco
(2016) further extend this approach of generating and scoring implicit positive interpretations by apply-
ing it to modal constructions.

3 Dataset and Task

The dataset created by Blanco and Sarabi (2016) contains 1,888 positive interpretations generated from
600 negated verbs in OntoNotes 5.0 (Hovy et al., 2006). These positive interpretations are automatically
generated by ﬁrst converting the negated statement into its positive counterpart by (1) removing the
negation mark, (2) removing auxiliaries, expanding contractions and ﬁxing third-person singular and
past tense, and (3) rewriting negatively-oriented polarity-sensitive items (e.g. anyone becomes someone).
From this positive counterpart, positive interpretations are generated by rewriting each semantic role or
the (originally negated) verb. For example, ARG0-ARG4 are rewritten as someone / some people /
something, and ARGM-TMP is rewritten as at some point of time. To illustrate, this results in the three
positive interpretations listed for Sentence 2.

but not ‘exist’

(b) {someone / some people / something} exist in many places in the world.

but not ‘The proper climatic conditions’

(c) The proper climatic conditions exist {somewhere}.

but not ‘in many places in the world’

On average, 3.15 positive interpretations are generated per negation, each of which is manually scored
with a value between 0 and 5. A positive interpretation with a score of 5 is deemed very plausible given
the context (i.e. the previous and next sentence), whereas a score of 0 indicates that this interpretation is
highly implausible. Inter-annotator agreement is calculated using Pearson’s correlation and is reported to
be 0.761. The task is deﬁned as a regression task, where each positive interpretation becomes an instance
for which the system should produce a score.

3.1 Data releases

The dataset of scored positive interpretations is not publicly available, but the authors provided us with
all their annotations. Blanco and Sarabi (2016) have used the CoNLL-2011 Shared Task distribution
of OntoNotes1 (Pradhan et al., 2011). In order to use the annotations for learning, both OntoNotes 5.0
and the CoNLL-2011 Shared Task release are required, since the latter contains all annotations but not
the underlying words. The organizers of this shared task provide scripts and instructions to merge the
annotations with the words in OntoNotes. Originally, the data was meant to be merged with the data
from OntoNotes 4.0,2 but it can also be used with OntoNotes 5.0,3 which is the ﬁnal release of the
OntoNotes project. The resulting .conll ﬁles contain a merged representation of all the OntoNotes
layers in CoNLL-style tabular format with one line per token, and with multiple columns specifying the
annotations for each token. This format is similar to the CoNLL-formatted release of OntoNotes 5.0.4
However, there are two important differences between the two CoNLL-formatted releases. First, for

complete dataset.

CoNLL-2011 some of the documents were split into smaller parts to reduce the complexity of coreference
annotation, which increases with the length of a document. Second, disﬂuencies in conversation data
(e.g. restarts, hesitations), which are marked with a special EDITED phrase tag in the original OntoNotes
parses, were removed. The splitting of documents and removal of disﬂuencies result in different sentence
and token identiﬁers, since sentence numbering restarts for each document part and token count excludes
disﬂuent tokens. Therefore, the CoNLL-2011 release is required for resolving the identiﬁers used in the
positive interpretations dataset. However, the CoNLL-2011 release does not provide gold annotations for
the complete dataset; for the test set used for this shared task, only automatic annotations are provided.
The gold annotations required to replicate the experiment by Blanco and Sarabi (2016) were provided to
us by the authors instead.

4 Regression Task: Scoring Positive Interpretations

The system for scoring the positive interpretations as reported in (Blanco and Sarabi, 2016) is not publicly
available. However, since the authors provided us with the annotations and the required OntoNotes data,
we were able to replicate their experiment for further analysis.

4.1 Experimental set-up

Simulating the approach reported by Blanco and Sarabi (2016), we trained a Support Vector Machine
(SVM) for regression with RBF kernel using scikit-learn (Pedregosa et al., 2011) with the set of features

presented in Table 1. Whereas Blanco and Sarabi (2016) report on results obtained with features extracted
from gold-standard and predicted linguistic annotations, we only report on those obtained from the gold-
standard annotations in the CoNLL-2011 dataset. We compare the results to a baseline system that
simply takes the mean score of the semantic role from which the positive interpretation was generated as
calculated over our train set (Table 2). Blanco and Sarabi (2016) evaluate their results using Pearson’s
correlation (r). However, we question the appropriateness of this evaluation measure, since Pearson’s r
assumes that the data is continuous and (at least approximately) normally distributed. Whereas the
predicted scores are continuous indeed, the gold scores are rather ordinal of nature. Moreover, the data is
not normally distributed, as can be seen in Figure 1. Therefore, we report our results using two additional
evaluation measures: Spearman’s correlation (ρ) with correction for ties, which can be used when the
assumptions of Pearson’s r are not met, and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), which is the standard
deviation of the residuals (prediction errors). RMSE is a measure of how spread out the residuals are;
this way, it informs how concentrated the predicted scores are around the line of best ﬁt. Lower values
of RMSE indicate better ﬁt, and since it is an absolute measure with the same units as the score being
estimated, the values should be interpreted in the same range, in our case, between 0 and 5.

Unfortunately, due to time constraints, the authors were not (yet) able to provide us with the train/test
splits as used in their paper. Therefore, we created our own test set using the same approach: we used a
80/20 split and made sure that all positive interpretations belonging to one negated verb were assigned
to either the train or the test set.

4.2 Results

Table 3 presents the results of our experiments with the different combinations of feature sets on the
regression task. We observe that, depending on the evaluation measure, different systems perform best.
We also observe that our results are mostly comparable to those reported in (Blanco and Sarabi, 2016),

(a) Baseline (mean)

(b) Best-performing system in (Blanco and Sarabi, 2016)

(c) Baseline (mean)

(d) Best-performing system in (Blanco and Sarabi, 2016)

Figure 2: The upper ﬁgures show regression lines with a 95% conﬁdence interval. The observations are
collapsed in bins to plot an estimate of central tendency. The lower ﬁgures show regression lines per
semantic role.

although just using the semrole label as feature shows better results and is even the second-best system
after our baseline, if we consider Pearson’s r and the RMSE scores. This contradicts the ﬁnding of Blanco
and Sarabi (2016), who found that considering all features yields the best performance. However, we
emphasize that we tested on a different test set than Blanco and Sarabi (2016), so it is possible that this
accounts for the differences in results. If we look at Spearman’s ρ, the feature combination {semrole,
verb-semrole} performs best, followed by {verb, semrole label, verb-semrole, verbarg-struct}.

Figures 2a-2d visualize the regression lines for the baseline system and for the system that was reported
as best-performing in (Blanco and Sarabi, 2016). We show both the overall tendency as the relation
between the gold and the predicted scores per semantic role. As expected, Figure 2c shows ﬂat lines for
each semantic role, corresponding to the mean scores of each, except for those semantic roles that occur
only once in the test set (ARG3, ARGM-CAU and ARGM-PRP) and ARG4, which is correctly scored
as 5 in all cases. In contrast, Figure 2d shows more variation within most semantic roles (indicated by
their slope), but in general, the predicted scores are too high, as can also be concluded from the overall
overview in Figure 2b. In fact, the lowest predicted score according to this system is 2.96. The baseline
seems to account a bit better for the lower and middle scores (the lowest predicted score is 2).

5 Classiﬁcation Task: Classifying Positive Interpretations as TRUE or FALSE

In a second experiment, we redeﬁne the task as a classiﬁcation task. We argue that the scores assigned
to each positive interpretation in the dataset reﬂect the conﬁdence of the annotators rather than what we
are interested in predicting. In other words, in the end a binary classiﬁcation system that can predict
whether some positive meaning is implied in a negated statement or not would sufﬁce in most real-world
applications. Instead of predicting a score between 0 and 5, one option is thus to redeﬁne the task as
a binary classiﬁcation problem where each positive interpretation is to be classiﬁed as either TRUE or
FALSE. The original annotated scores can easily be divided: all scores between 0-2 become FALSE,
and all scores between 3-5 become TRUE. However, intuitively, it is clear that the scores 2 and 3 are
somewhat problematic in the sense that they present the middle cases that less clearly belong to either
class. Therefore, these two scores could potentially make up their own class of UNCERTAIN. As can be
seen in Figure 3, the UNCERTAIN class comprises a considerably large portion of the complete dataset.

5.1 Experimental set-up

We use the same sets of features to train an SVM with RBF kernel, but now for classiﬁcation.
We apply it to both the binary classiﬁcation task (TRUE/FALSE) and the tertiary classiﬁcation task
(TRUE/FALSE/UNCERTAIN). The results are evaluated using precision, recall and F1-measure. We use
weighted averaging for all scores, which accounts for class imbalance by computing the average of bi-
nary metrics in which each class’ score is weighted by its presence in the true data sample. Our baseline
system takes the most frequent class of the semantic role from which the positive interpretation was
generated (corresponding to the classes in bold in Table 4 in both tasks).

5.2 Results

We summarize our results on both the tertiary and the binary classiﬁcation tasks in Table 5. None of
the feature combinations were able to beat the most-frequent baseline, which achieves an F1-measure of
0.725 with three classes and 0.840 with two classes. The differences with the second-best system, which
uses only semrole label as a feature, are small (0.721 and 0.834 respectively), but adding more features
only appears to hurt performance. This is mostly in line with what we observed in the regression task. We
analyzed the precision, recall and F1-measure per class for each of the feature combinations and observe
that for most of them, the FALSE class performs 0.0 on each in both tasks, except for the better performing
ones (indicated with bold scores in Table 5). Moreover, the UNCERTAIN class always performs 0.0 in
the tertiary task, including the baseline. In the binary task, the baseline achieves 0.65 / 0.89 / 0.75 on
precision, recall and F1-measure on the FALSE class and 0.95 / 0.81 / 0.87 on the TRUE class. In the
tertiary task, the respective scores are 0.54 / 0.91 / 0.68 (FALSE) and 0.91 / 0.85 / 0.88 (TRUE).

Table 5: Results of the Support Vector Machine (SVM) for classiﬁcation with RBF kernel with different
feature sets on the classiﬁcation task with three classes and with two classes.

5.3 Error analysis

The results on the classiﬁcation task can easily be explained if we have another look at Figure 3 and
Table 4. ARG0, ARG1 and V are by far the most frequent cases in the dataset and their classes are
very imbalanced. ARGM-ADV, ARGM-CAU and ARGM-DIR are the only roles for which FALSE is the
most frequent class and the classes are somewhat balanced, but these roles are not as well represented
in the dataset. As expected, our error analysis on the results of the baseline show that the positive
interpretations generated from the verb itself comprise the largest portion of classiﬁcation errors: 39 out
of 63 (62%) were incorrectly predicted as FALSE. This is followed by ARGM-ADV (16%, incorrectly
predicted as FALSE), ARG1 (8%, TRUE), ARGM-TMP (5%, TRUE) and ARG0 (3%, TRUE). ARG2,
ARGM-DIR, ARGM-LOC and ARGM-PRP were only misclassiﬁed once. From these results, we learn
that the challenge of this task is to make a system perform well for the minority classes of each role. In
other words, we need to know when the verb or ARGM-ADV results to TRUE and when the other roles
result to FALSE.

We discuss some examples of misclassiﬁcation. According to the gold annotations, the positive inter-
pretation generated from the verb create in Sentence 3 results to TRUE. We argue that this is because the
sentence contains contrastive focus. That is, create contrasts with another verb mentioned in the previous
context: enrich. Evidence is provided by the subject being shared between the verbs, i.e. a diversity of
cultures. Generally speaking, implicit positive meanings involving contrasting actions seem to be more
easily evoked when the verb has a strong antonym, even if this is not explicitly mentioned in the context.
For example, verbs like win (lose) or like (dislike) are more likely to give rise to alternatives than verbs
that do not have a clear opposite meaning, such as write.

3. [A diversity of cultures]ARG0 will only enrich a person, not create [a crisis of identity]ARG1.

A diversity of cultures will only enrich a person, {some verb / action / state} a crisis of identity, but
not ‘create’

Another observation in the TRUE positive interpretations generated from the verb, is that many of them
contain coreferential expressions. For example, all semantic roles belonging to the negated verb in
Sentence 4 consist of pronouns, indicating that the agent and patient have already been introduced in the
previous context. The acceptability of this positive interpretation seems to be a result of new information
focus, since the only ‘new’ information is the action expressed by the verb. This makes it more likely
that the negation of the action is what the author intended to convey.

4. But [he]ARG0 didn’t win [it]ARG1.

But he {some verb / action / state} it, but not ‘won’

Sentence 5, on the other hand, illustrates how information that is already introduced in the previous
context is less likely to be in the pragmatic scope of negation. The ARG1, the advance, is coreferential
with gained in the preceding context; the new, relevant information is the lack of participation of many
issues in this advance. Therefore, in this case, the positive interpretation generated from this semantic
role is FALSE instead of the more frequent TRUE class associated with ARG1.

5. But while the Composite gained 1.19, to 462.89, [many issues]ARG0 didn’t participate [in the

advance]ARG1.
But while the Composite gained 1.19, to 462.89, many issues participated {in someone / some
people / something}, but not ‘in the advance’

6 Discussion and future work

The relation between information structure and inference is an interesting research area that needs further
exploration in computational linguistics. Blanco and Moldovan (2011) laid some important groundwork
for deriving implicit positive meaning from negations by trying to detect the (single) focus of negation.
However, as correctly noted by Anand and Martell (2012), implicit positive meaning only indirectly
results from focus. This is partially because, as Kawamura (2007) explains, negation does not require a
focused element (in contrast to focus-sensitive elements such as only, even and either) and at the same
time induces ambiguity in focus constructions. That is, negation without focus can still be grammatical;
its absence simply produces a different interpretation. If the sentence does contain focus, negation yields
a focus-associated reading (6a) and a non-associated reading (6b), as Kawamura (2007) illustrates with
the example below. This ambiguity has been regarded as a result of the scope interaction of focus and
negation (Jackendoff, 1972; Krifka, 2006).

6. John didn’t criticize Mary [at the conference]FOCUS.

(a) John criticized Mary. It was not at the conference.
(b) John did something other than criticizing Mary. It happened at the conference.

Therefore, we think Blanco and Sarabi (2016) improved upon the task by scoring each and every po-
tential positive interpretation generated from the negation. The question remains, however, whether we
really need to score positive interpretations on a scale from 0 to 5. We believe that, from an application
perspective, classifying them as TRUE/FALSE (and optionally UNCERTAIN) is sufﬁcient.

We have shown that class imbalance in the dataset is the reason why our baseline performs so well
on the task, and that –even though there is no one-to-one correspondence between focus and implicit
positive meaning– knowing which part of the proposition is new or contrastive seems to play a crucial
role in correctly predicting the infrequent classes. We therefore argue that an approach to detecting
implicit meaning should aim to include this pragmatic layer of information. The features described in
this paper only partially capture this layer since they rely on explicit signals within the sentence (i.e. by
determining which information is present and in what position), but they do not take context into account.
However, we need more annotated data and more experiments to conﬁrm our hypothesis.

Special cases of negation that we would like to highlight here are those that contain negatively-oriented
polarity-sensitive items, such as anyone, anything or either. In the current deﬁnition of the task, these

items are rewritten to positively-oriented polarity-sensitive items (e.g. anyone becomes someone, any-
thing becomes something) before generating the positive interpretations. For example, Sentence 7 would
result in the interpretations 7a and 7b with this procedure. While 7a may be classiﬁed as UNCERTAIN
(or, less likely, as TRUE), 7b will always be FALSE. Moreover, neither interpretations cover the actual
meaning of the sentence. Instead, it should be interpreted as “Kim read nothing”, which in turn brings us
to the next question: how to deal with other markers of negation, such as nothing or nobody? We suggest
treating sentences with these kind of markers of negation or with negatively-oriented polarity-sensitive
items both as special cases that probably do not need any annotation, since their correct interpretation
directly follows from the meaning of the words.

7. Kim didn’t read anything.

(a) {someone / some people / something} read something (but not Kim)
(b) Kim read {something}

Finally, while the task explored in this paper restricts itself to negation, it could possibly be extended to
include also inferences resulting from focus in sentences without negation or with other focus-sensitive
elements. As Kawamura (2007), among others, describes, the semantic effect of focus depends on the
type of focus-sensitive elements present in the sentence. As noted above, some focus-sensitive elements
require a focused element for their interpretation, while others do not. In addition, in sentences without
focus-sensitive elements, focus-shift does not affect the truth conditions (even though intuitively the
interpretations are different), whereas the truth conditions of sentences with a focus-sensitive element
such as only do change. That is, if John reads something other than books in the bathroom, Sentence 8a
and 8b can both be TRUE, while the focus-shift causes Sentence 9a to be FALSE.

8.

9.

(a) John reads [books]FOCUS in the bathroom.
(b) John reads books [in the bathroom]FOCUS.

(a) John only reads [books]FOCUS in the bathroom.
(b) John only reads books [in the bathroom]FOCUS.

This leaves us with many opportunities for future work to further investigate the inferences and truth
conditions of sentences in relation to the interaction between focus and focus-sensitive elements.

7 Conclusion

We reimplemented a system for scoring implicit positive interpretations from negated statements for the
purpose of understanding its performance, the task itself and the role that different features play. We have
argued that the original task could be redeﬁned as a classiﬁcation task, where each positive interpretation
is to be classiﬁed as TRUE or FALSE (optionally, with a third class of UNCERTAIN representing the middle
cases). We showed that a simple baseline that takes the mean over the scores or the most frequent class
per semantic role is hard to beat in both the regression and the classiﬁcation tasks. Our error analysis
indicated that improvements can only be achieved with a system that is able to account for the infrequent
classes, and we hypothesize that modeling informativeness (e.g. new information or contrastive focus)
may be useful in this respect. This would require looking beyond the syntactic and semantic character-
istics of the proposition and taking the broader context into account. Our code is publicly available at
https://github.com/cltl/positive-interpretations.
