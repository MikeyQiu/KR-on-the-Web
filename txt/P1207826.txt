Abstract

introduce Discriminative BLEU
We
(∆BLEU), a novel metric for intrinsic
evaluation of generated text in tasks that
admit a diverse range of possible outputs.
Reference strings are scored for quality
by human raters on a scale of [−1, +1]
to weight multi-reference BLEU. In tasks
involving generation of conversational
responses, ∆BLEU correlates reasonably
with human judgments and outperforms
sentence-level and IBM BLEU in terms of
both Spearman’s ρ and Kendall’s τ .

Introduction

Many natural language processing tasks involve
the generation of texts where a variety of outputs
are acceptable or even desirable. Tasks with intrin-
sically diverse targets range from machine transla-
tion, summarization, sentence compression, para-
phrase generation, and image-to-text to generation
of conversational interactions. A major hurdle for
these tasks is automation of evaluation, since the
space of plausible outputs can be enormous, and
it is it impractical to run a new human evaluation
every time a new model is built or parameters are
modiﬁed.

In Statistical Machine Translation (SMT), the
automation problem has to a large extent been ame-
liorated by metrics such as BLEU (Papineni et al.,
2002) and METEOR (Banerjee and Lavie, 2005)
Although BLEU is not immune from criticism (e.g.,
Callison-Burch et al. (2006)), its properties are well

understood, BLEU scores have been shown to cor-
relate well with human judgments (Doddington,
2002; Coughlin, 2003; Graham and Baldwin, 2014;
Graham et al., 2015) in SMT, and it has allowed
the ﬁeld to proceed.

BLEU has been less successfully applied to non-
SMT generation tasks owing to the larger space
of plausible outputs. As a result, attempts have
been made to adapt the metric. To foster diversity
in paraphrase generation, Sun and Zhou (2012)
propose a metric called iBLEU in which the BLEU
score is discounted by a BLEU score computed be-
tween the source and paraphrase. This solution,
in addition to being dependent on a tunable pa-
rameter, is speciﬁc only to paraphrase. In image
captioning tasks, Vendantam et al. (2015), employ
a variant of BLEU in which n-grams are weighted
by tf ·idf. This assumes the availability of a corpus
with which to compute tf ·idf. Both the above can
be seen as attempting to capture a notion of target
goodness that is not being captured in BLEU.

In this paper, we introduce Discriminative BLEU
(∆BLEU), a new metric that embeds human judg-
ments concerning the quality of reference sen-
tences directly into the computation of corpus-level
multiple-reference BLEU. In effect, we push part of
the burden of human evaluation into the automated
metric, where it can be repeatedly utilized.

Our testbed for this metric is data-driven con-
versation, a ﬁeld that has begun to attract inter-
est (Ritter et al., 2011; Sordoni et al., 2015) as an
alternative to conventional rule-driven or scripted
dialog systems. Intrinsic evaluation in this ﬁeld
is exceptionally challenging because the semantic
space of possible responses resists deﬁnition and is
only weakly constrained by conversational inputs.
Below, we describe ∆BLEU and investigate its
characteristics in comparison to standard BLEU in
the context of conversational response generation.

We demonstrate that ∆BLEU correlates well with
human evaluation scores in this task and thus can
provide a basis for automated training and evalua-
tion of data-driven conversation systems—and, we
ultimately believe, other text generation tasks with
inherently diverse targets.

data with the hope of ﬁnding distinct responses,
but this solution is not feasible. Indeed, the larger
the context, the less likely we are to ﬁnd pairs that
match exactly. Furthermore, while it is feasible to
have writers create additional references when the
downstream task is relatively unambiguous (e.g.,
MT), this approach is more questionable in the
case of more subjective tasks such as conversa-
tional response generation. Our solution is to mine
candidate responses from conversational data and
have judges rate the quality of these responses. Our
new metric thus naturally incorporates qualitative
weights associated with references.

2 Evaluating Conversational Responses

3 Discriminative BLEU

Given an input message m and a prior conversation
history c,
the goal of a response generation
system is to produce a hypothesis h that is both
well-formed and a pertinent response to message
m (example in Fig. 1). We assume that a set of J
references {ri,j} is available for the context ci and
message mi, where i ∈ {1 . . . I} is an index over
the test set. In the case of BLEU,1 the automatic
score of the system output h1 . . . hI is deﬁned as:

with:

BLEU = BP · exp

(cid:18) (cid:88)

(cid:19)

log pn

n

(cid:40)

BP =

1
e(1−ρ/η)

if η > ρ
otherwise

(1)

(2)

where ρ and η are respectively hypothesis and refer-
ence lengths.2 Then corpus-level n-gram precision
is deﬁned as:

pn =

(cid:80)

(cid:80)
i

g ∈ n-grams(hi) maxj
(cid:80)
i

(cid:80)

g ∈ n-grams(hi) #g(hi)

(cid:8)#g(hi, ri,j)(cid:9)

where #g(·) is the number of occurrences of
n-gram g in a given sentence, and #g(u, v) is a
shorthand for min (cid:8)#g(u), #g(v)(cid:9).

It has been demonstrated that metrics such as
BLEU show increased correlation with human judg-
ment as the number of references increases (Przy-
bocki et al., 2008; Dreyer and Marcu, 2012). Unfor-
tunately, gathering multiple references is difﬁcult
in the case of conversations. Data gathered from
naturally occurring conversations offer only one
response per message. One could search (c, m)
pairs that occur multiple times in conversational

1Unless mentioned otherwise, BLEU refers to the original

IBM BLEU as ﬁrst described in (Papineni et al., 2002).

2In the case of multiple references, BLEU selects the refer-

ence whose length is closest to that of the hypothesis.

Discriminative BLEU, or ∆BLEU, extends BLEU
by exploiting human qualitative judgments wi,j ∈
[−1, +1] associated with references ri,j. It is dis-
criminative in that it both rewards matches with
“good” reference responses (w > 0) and penalizes
matches with “bad” reference responses (w < 0).
Formally, ∆BLEU is deﬁned as in Equation 1 and 2,
except that pn is instead deﬁned as:

(cid:80)

(cid:80)
i

g ∈ n-grams(hi) maxj:g ∈ ri,j
(cid:80)
g ∈ n-grams(hi) maxj
i

(cid:80)

(cid:8)wi,j ·#g(hi, ri,j)(cid:9)
(cid:8)wi,j ·#g(hi)(cid:9)

In a nutshell, this is saying that each n-gram match
is weighted by the highest scoring reference in
which it occurs, and this weight can sometimes be
negative. To ensure that the denominator is never
zero, we assume that, for each i there exists at least
one reference ri,j whose weight wi,j is strictly pos-
itive. In addition to its discriminative nature, this
metric has two interesting properties. First, if all
weights wi,j are equal to 1, then the metric score is
identical to BLEU. As such, ∆BLEU admits BLEU
as a special case. Second, as with IBM BLEU, the
maximum theoretical score is also 1. If the hy-
pothesis happens to match the highest weighted
reference for each sentence, the numerator equals
the denominator and the metric score becomes 1.
While we ﬁnd this metric particularly appropriate
for response generation, the metric makes no as-
sumption on the task and is applicable to other text
generation tasks such as MT and image captioning.

methodology of Sordoni et al. (2015). From a cor-
pus of 29M Twitter context-message-response con-
versational triples, we randomly extracted approxi-
mately 33K candidate triples that were then judged
for conversational quality on a 5-point Likert-type
scale by 3 crowdsourced annotators. Of these, 4232
triples scored an average 4 or higher; these were
randomly binned to create seed dev and test sets
of 2118 triples and 2114 triples respectively. Note
that the dev set is not used in the experiments of
this paper, since ∆BLEU and IBM BLEU are met-
rics that do not require training. However, the dev
set is released along with a test set in the dataset
release accompanying this paper.

We then sought to identify candidate triples in
the 29M corpus for which both message and re-
sponse are similar to the original messages and
responses in these seed sets. To this end, we em-
ployed an information retrieval algorithm with a
bag-of-words BM25 similarity function (Robertson
et al., 1995), as detailed in Sordoni et al. (2015),
to extract the top 15 responses for each message-
response pair. Unlike Sordoni et al. (2015), we
further appended the original messages (as if par-

roted back). The new triples were then scored for
quality of the response in light of both context and
message by 5 crowdsourced raters each on a 5-
point Likert-type scale.3 Crucially, and again in
contradistinction to Sordoni et al. (2015), we did
not impose a score cutoff on these synthetic multi-
reference sets. Instead, we retained all candidate
responses and scaled their scores into [−1, +1].

Table 1 presents representative multi-reference
examples (from the dev set) together with their con-
verted scores. The context and messages associated
with the supplementary mined responses are also
shown for illustrative purposes to demonstrate the
range of conversations from which they were taken.
In the table, negative-weighted mined responses are
semantically orthogonal to the intent of their newly
assigned context and message. Strongly negatively
weighted responses are completely out of the ball-
park (“the weather in Russia is very cool”, “well
then! Why were the biscuits needed?”); others are a
little more plausible, but irrelevant or possibly topic

seed responses for consistency with the mined responses. As a
result, scores for some seed responses slipped below our initial
threshold of 4. Nonetheless, these responses were retained.

changing (“ohh I love that song”). Higher-valued
positive-weighted mined responses are typically
reasonably appropriate and relevant (even though
extracted from a completely unrelated conversa-
tion), and in some cases can outscore the original
response, as can be seen in the third set of exam-
ples.

4.2 Human Evaluation of System Outputs

Responses generated by the 7 systems used in this
study on the 2114-triple test set were hand evalu-
ated by 5 crowdsourced raters each on a 5-point
Likert-type scale. From these 7 systems, 12 system
pairs were evaluated, for a total of about pairwise
126K ratings (12 · 5 · 2114). Here too, raters were
asked to evaluate responses in terms of their rele-
vance to both context and message. Outputs from
different systems were randomly interleaved for
presentation to the raters. We obtained human rat-
ings on the following systems:

Phrase-based MT: A phrase-based MT system
similar to (Ritter et al., 2011), whose weights
have been manually tuned. We also included
four variants of that system, which we tuned with
MERT (Och, 2003). These variants differ in their
number of features, and augment (Ritter et al.,
2011) with the following phrase-level features: edit
distance between source and target, cosine similar-
ity, Jaccard index and distance, length ratio, and
DSSM score (Huang et al., 2013).
RNN-based MT: the log-probability according to
the RNN model of (Sordoni et al., 2015).
Baseline: a random baseline.

While ∆BLEU relies on human qualitative judg-
ments, it is important to note that human judgments
on multi-references (§ 4.1) and those on system out-
puts were collected completely independently. We
also note that the set of systems listed above specif-
ically does not include a retrieval-based model, as
this might have introduced spurious correlation be-
tween the two datasets (§ 4.1 and § 4.2).

5 Setup

We use two rank correlation coefﬁcients—
Kendall’s τ and Spearman’s ρ—to assess the level
of correlation between human qualitative ratings
(§4.2) and automated metric scores. More formally,
we compute each correlation coefﬁcient on a series
of paired observations (m1, q1), · · · , (mN , qN ).
Here, mi and qi are respectively differences in auto-
matic metric scores and qualitative ratings for two

given systems A and B on a given subset of the
test set.4While much prior work assesses automatic
metrics for MT and other tasks (Lavie and Agarwal,
2007; Hodosh et al., 2013) by computing correla-
tions on observations consisting of single-sentence
system outputs, it has been shown (e.g., Przybocki
et al. (2008)) that correlation coefﬁcients signiﬁ-
cantly increase as observation units become larger.
For instance, corpus-level or system-level correla-
tions tend to be much higher than sentence-level
correlations; Graham and Baldwin (2014) show
that BLEU is competitive with more recent and ad-
vanced metrics when assessed at the system level.5
Therefore, we deﬁne our observation unit size to
be M = 100 sentences (responses),6 unless stated
otherwise. We evaluate qi by averaging human rat-
ings on the M sentences, and mi by computing
metric scores on the same set of sentences.7 We
compare three different metrics: BLEU, ∆BLEU,
and sentence-level BLEU (sBLEU). The last com-
putes sentence-level BLEU scores (Nakov et al.,
2012) and averages them on the M sentences (akin
to macro-averaging). Finally, unless otherwise
noted, all versions of BLEU use n-gram order up
to 2 (BLEU-2), as this achieves better correlation
for all metrics on this data.

6 Results

The main results of our study are shown in Table 2.
∆BLEU achieves better correlation with human
than BLEU, when comparing the best conﬁgura-
tion of each metric.8 In the case of Spearman’s ρ,

4For each given observation pair (mi, qi), we randomize
the order in which A and B are presented to the raters in order
to avoid any positional bias.

5We do not intend to minimize the beneﬁt of a metric that
would be competitive at the sentence-level, which would be
particularly useful for detailed error analyses. However, our
main goal is to reliably evaluate generation systems on test
sets of thousands of sentences, in which case any metric with
good corpus-level correlation (such as BLEU, as shown in
(Graham and Baldwin, 2014)) would be sufﬁcient.

6Enumerating all possible ways of assigning sentences to
observations would cause a combinatorial explosion. Instead,
for all our results we sample 1K assignments and average
correlations coefﬁcients over them (using the same 1K assign-
ments across all metrics). These assignments are done in such
a way that all sentences within an observation belong to the
same system pair.

7We refrained from using larger units, as creating larger
observation units M reduces the total number of units N . This
would have caused conﬁdence intervals to be so wide as to
make this study inconclusive.

8This is also the case on single reference. While ∆BLEU
and BLEU would have the same correlation if original refer-
ences all had the same score of 1, it is not unusual for original
references to get ratings below 1.

references (w ≥ 0.6), and all references.

the conﬁdence intervals of BLEU (.265, .416) and
∆BLEU (.415, .546) barely overlap, while interval
overlap is more signiﬁcant in the case of Kendall’s
τ . Correlation coefﬁcients degrade for BLEU as
we go from w ≥ 0.6 to using all references. This
is expected, since BLEU treats all references as
equal and has no way of discriminating between
them. On the other hand, correlation coefﬁcients
increase for ∆BLEU after adding lower scoring ref-
erences. It is also worth noticing that BLEU and
sBLEU obtain roughly comparable correlation co-
efﬁcients. This may come as a surprise, because it
has been suggested elsewhere that sBLEU has much
worse correlation than BLEU computed at the cor-
pus level (Przybocki et al., 2008). We surmise that
(at least for this task and data) the differences in
correlations between BLEU and sBLEU observed
in prior work may be less the result of a difference
between micro- and macro-averaging than they are
the effect of different observation unit sizes (as
discussed in §5).

Finally, Figure 2 shows how Spearman’s ρ is
affected along three dimensions of study. In par-
ticular, we see that ∆BLEU actually beneﬁts from
the references with negative ratings. While the im-
provement is not pronounced, we note that most ref-
erences have positive ratings. Negatively-weighted
references could have a greater effect if, for exam-
ple, randomly extracted responses had also been
annotated.

7 Conclusions

∆BLEU correlates well with human quality judg-
ments of generated conversational responses, out-
performing both IBM BLEU and sentence-level
BLEU in this task and demonstrating that it can
serve as a plausible intrinsic metric for system de-

versions of BLEU.

velopment.9 An upfront cost is paid for human
evaluation of the reference set, but following that,
the need for further human evaluation can be min-
imized during system development. ∆BLEU may
help other tasks that use multiple references for
intrinsic evaluation, including image-to-text, sen-
tence compression, and paraphrase generation, and
even statistical machine translation. Evaluation of
∆BLEU in these tasks awaits future work.
