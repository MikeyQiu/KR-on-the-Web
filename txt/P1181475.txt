Abstract   
 
The power law is ubiquitous in natural and social phenomena, and is considered as a 
universal  relationship  between  the  frequency  and  its  rank  for  diverse  social  systems. 
However,  a  general  model  is  still  lacking  to  interpret  why  these  seemingly  unrelated 
systems share great similarity. Through a detailed analysis of natural language texts and 
simulation experiments based on the proposed ‘Hierarchical Selection Model’, we found 
that the existence of hierarchies and human’s pursuit of top hierarchy lead to the power 
law. Further, the power law is a statistical and emergent performance of hierarchies, and it 
is the universality of hierarchies that contributes to the ubiquity of the power law.

Introduction 
 
The  frequency  and  its  rank  of  numerous  natural  and  man-made  phenomena  can  be 
described  as  the  power-law  relationship
,  where  p  is  the  frequency  of  the 
occurrence,  r  indicates  the  frequency  rank,  and  the  constant  α  is  referred  to  as  the 
power-law exponent. Research has documented a large number of phenomena that follow 
the power law, such as the city populations [1,2], individual wealth [3,4], firm sizes [5], 
the frequency of occurrence of personal  names [6],  the number of citations received by 
papers  [7],  the  scale  of  war  [8],  the  sales  volume  of  books,  music  disks  [9],  market 
fluctuations[10], moon craters [11], the numbers of species in biological taxa [12], energy 
released  in  earthquakes  [13]  and  so  on  [a  review  see  14].  According  to  incomplete 
statistics,  about  800  articles  and  monographs  have  been  published  [15]  by  June  2011. 
Among  all  different  interpretations  of  the  relationship,  of  great  fame  is  Zipf's  law  [1], 
theorizing  that  in  texts  of  human  language,  the  frequency  of  a  word  has  an  inverse 
proportion to its rank.   

Approaches differ in this line of research. Some studies have investigated particular 
phenomena  associated  with  specific  areas  [16-21],  whereas  others  propose  several

mechanisms  to  account  for  these  phenomena  [22-25].  However,  most  of  these 
mechanisms  have  only 
introduced  an  abstract  model,  without  providing  solid 
explanations  related  with  general  phenomena.  Moreover,  some  fundamental  questions 
still remain open for discussion. One key question is what kind of universality is reflected 
in the power law. Specifically, does the frequency rank in the power law only represent 
the rank of the frequency, or is it related with the meaning of the power law? What is the 
significance of the power-law exponent α? What factors contribute to the change of the 
power-law exponent?   

To explore the above questions, this study proposed the Hierarchical Selection Model 
by examining a large pool of natural language texts. To anticipate, this model can explain 
the meaning of the power law exponent and almost all of the frequency-rank relationships, 
and  provide  a  controlling  method  for  the  power  law  system.  These  explanations  have 
gained support from previous research, and the predications of this model are broadly in 
line  with  the  natural  and  social  phenomena.  We  found  that  for  diverse  phenomena  in 
human society, the existence of hierarchies and human’s preference for top hierarchy lead 
to the power law. In other words, the power law is a statistical and emergent performance 
of hierarchies. Given that “It is a commonplace observation that nature loves hierarchies” 
[26], the power law also possesses the characteristics of popularity and universality. 
 
2    Text analysis and the linguistic meaning of power law 
 

 
Words in text are sequenced according to  rules and purposes. Some words, such as 
function  words,  can  appear  in  texts  of  any  topic,  whereas  many  content  words  only 
appear in texts of associated topics, suggesting that the distribution frequency of a word is 
associated  with  topics  it  can  appear  in.  It  is  likely  that  the  frequency  rank  is  also 
correlated  with  topics.  In  the  present  study,  we  chose  short  news  reports  with  different 
topics as  the pool  of  texts  data  in  order  to  explore the influence of topic number  that  a 
word can appear in  upon the word frequency distribution,  and to  further investigate the 
significance of word frequency rank. 

The pool  of texts data is composed  of 10,287,433 word tokens, with  138,243 word 
types.  The  texts  include  8  topic  subsets,  namely,  IT,  health,  sports,  tourism,  education, 
employment,  history  and military. Each subset  contains about  1990  short  Chinese  news 
reports.  Table  1  is  an  overview  of  the  texts  and  the  eight  topics,  specifically,  the  word 
number,  cumulative  word  frequency  in  topics,  and  their  respective  power-law  fitness 
results  between  the  word  frequency  and  its  rank  of  each  topic  and  the  collection  of  all 
texts.  Here,  the  curve  fitting  was  obtained  by  using  the  method  of  least  squares.  The 
results  include  the  goodness  of  fit  (Adjusted  R2)  and  the  power  law  coefficients.  This 
method was adopted in the following power-law fit. Figure 1 depicts the curves of log-log 
coordinate  of  the  word  frequency  of  total  texts  and  texts  of  each  topic  with  their 
corresponding frequency rank.

Fig. 1. The log-log coordination curves of the relationship between the word frequency and its rank in texts of 

8 topics and texts collection. 

The relationships between the word frequency and its rank in topics texts and texts 
collection  both  follow  the  power  law,  with  the  exponent  α  close  to  1.5.  However,  the 
exponent of the collection is around 1.7, evidently higher than all the subsets.   
  Words have their own distinctive contexts of occurrence in that some words appear in 
contexts  of  any  topic,  and  are  generally  high  in  word  frequency  but  low  in  word 
frequency  rank;  whereas  some  other  words  appear  only  in  a  few  topics,  and  in  general 
have a low word frequency but a high frequency rank. Apparently, the frequency rank of 
a word is associated with the number of topics this word appears in. As shown in Figure 2, 
the  horizontal  axis  is  the  word  frequency  rank,  and  the  vertical  axis  is  the  probability 
density.  Eight  curves  represent  the  number  distribution  of  topics  a  word  belongs  to 
(hereinafter referred to as 'the number of topics', abbreviated as ‘NT’). Curve 8 indicates 
that this word appears in all topics, regardless of any specific topic. Curve 1 indicates that 
this  word  is  only  used  in  one  topic,  a  highly  topic-specific  word.  As  plotted  is  the 
estimated  density  of  the  number  of  topics  for  a  word  using  a  kernel  smoothing  method 
[27]. Clearly, the number of words in each field  concentrated on the locations reversely 
3 

 

ordered  in  the  rank  of  word  frequency,  implicating  that  the  rank  of  word  frequency  is 
correlated with the NT.   

 

Fig. 2. The estimated density function of the number of topics distributing in word frequency rank. Eight distributions 

of NT are in sequence on the axis of Rank, indicating that the frequency rank also has the meaning of NT. 

To examine the nature of the NT, we calculated the number of words in each  field, 
the  average  word  frequency  rank,  and  the  power-law  fitting  results  of  word  frequency 
distribution in each field.   

 

Table 2 The distribution of various types of word. The meaning of the second column (Average word frequency rank), 

as  previously  mentioned  in  Fig.2,  is  that  the  average  word  frequency  rank  of  each  NT  has  a  monotonic  sequence, 

suggesting that there exists a correlation between NT and the rank; The third column (Number of words) indicates that 

NT has an inversed relationship with the number of words this NT has. The fifth column (Word frequency percentage) 

reveals that most words constituting a text are chosen from the NT=8 subset. The last two columns manifest that the 

word frequency in each NT follows the power law quite well.

With the increase of the  NT, the number of words is  monotonically decreasing, but 
begins  to  rise  when  the  NT  reaches  8  (Table  2),  thus  demonstrating  a  U-shaped 
distribution.  Further,  we  used  two  power  function  fits  for  the  relationship  between  the 
number of words and the NT. The fitting function is f (x) = 81530x-2.094 +69.9 x2.26, where 

 

4 

x represents the NT, f(x) is the number of words with NT as x. As seen from Table 2 and 
the  fitting  function,  two  rules  affect  the  number  of  words  in  a  field:  The  first  is  a 
decreasing rule, mainly relevant to the specific topic-related words occurring in  a small 
NT,  that  with  the  increase  of  the  topic  availability,  or  the  applicability  of  the  word,  the 
number  of  words  significantly  decreases  in  a  manner  of  power-law.  The  second  is  an 
increasing  rule,  mainly  relevant  to  the  topic-free  words,  that  when  the  use  of  word  is 
extending  to  any  field,  the  number  of  words  once  again  increases  in  the  manner  of 
power-law.   

To  further  analyze  the  relation  between  the  word  frequency  rank  and  the  NT,  we 
computed  their  correlation  coefficient.  The  number  of  words  in  each  field  obeys  a 
power-law,  so  computing  is  on  the  same  proportional  number  rather  than  the  same 
number  of  words.  The  resulting  correlational  coefficient  is  -0.9811,  suggesting  that  the 
frequency rank of a word is correlated with its NT.   

Next, we analyzed the distribution of cumulative word frequency in NT in Table 2. 
While  composing  a  text,  nearly  84%  words  have  the  NT  as  8,  and  put  differently,  are 
common  words  that  can  be  used  in  any  field.  Instead,  words  with  the  NT  1~6,  the 
frequency  ratios  are  about  1-2  percent.  For  the  NT  as  7,  the  word  frequency  is  slightly 
higher  than  that  of  the  NT  1~6.  The  power-law  fitting  results  for  the  word  frequency 
percentage  is  f  (x)  =  83.84(9-x)  -3.791,  with  goodness  adjusted  R2  =  0.9971,  where  x 
represents  the  NT,  and  f  is  the  word  frequency  percentage.  It  is  worth  noting  that  the 
group  of  words  with  the  smallest  number  (namely,  with  the  NT  as  8)  gets  the  highest 
word frequency percentage.   

In  addition,  among  words  with  a  same  NT,  only  a  small  number  of  words  have  an 
absolute high word frequency, whereas the majority of words have a very low frequency, 
the fitting results of which still follow the power law.   

The  distribution  of  word  frequency  in  each  field  (As  shown  in  Table  2  Column  5) 
indicates  when  we  conceptualize  what  we  intend  to  say,  we  are  most  likely  to  choose 
common words that can be used in all topics, and then a few content words help flesh out, 
making the expression specific and significant. Grammatically presented, all the common 
words can be taken as formulating a construction, and then the slots in this construction 
will be filled up with content words, thus forming a complete exposition, a notion that is 
consistent with the major tenets of Construction Grammar[28-30]. Given that the NT of a 
word  represents  how  many  topics  this  word  can  appear  in,  it  per  se  means  the  word’s 
‘expressive  ability’.  As  shown  in  Table  2,  the  higher  the  words’  ‘ability’,  the  fewer  the 
words.  That  is,  words  are  divided  into  different  hierarchies.  Albeit  that  the  number  of 
words at the highest hierarchy is the smallest, they have the highest probability of being 
selected, and vice versa.   

The data pattern here  suggests that in  human language, each  word has its own  NT, 
and the relationship between the number of words and the NT that words can appear in 
follows the power law. When people choose words to express ideas, most likely they will 
use words that are not limited by topics, indicating that word frequency and the degree of 

 

5 

limit have a power-law relationship. That is to say, the word frequency-rank is an inherent 
attribute of human languages, instead of being determined by any text. Taken together, it 
is  the  inherent  word  frequency  rank  of  a  language  and  these  several  power  laws  that 
generate the power law between word frequency and its rank.   
 
3  Hierarchical Selection Model and its simulation results 
 

 
As  displayed  in  Fig.  2  and  Table  2,  the  frequency  of  a  word  is  determined  by  the 
following  two  parameters:  One  is  the  NT  this  word  can  appear  in,  and  the  other  is  its 
probability  of  being  selected.  According  to  the  computation  of  conditional  probability, 
while choosing words to compose texts, the formation of word frequency can be divided 
into two steps: choose the NT, and then choose words among those with the same NT. In 
this  vein,  there  are  three  factors  affecting  the  relationship  between  the  word  frequency 
and its rank: First, the distribution of word numbers in NT fm (x), where x refers to the 
NT;  Second,  the  distribution  of  word  frequency  in  each  NT  fw  (x),  where  x  is  the 
frequency  rank  of  words  with  the  same  NT;  Third,  each  field’s  probability  of  being 
selected fc (x), where x represents the NT. 

To explore the generalizability of the power law, we propose a model from the above 

findings, named as "Hierarchical Selection Model":   

Given there are N 'objects', (the equivalent of words), belonging to M hierarchies 
(The hierarchy number is equivalent to the NT of words), M <<N;   
The  numbers  of  'objects'  at  different  hierarchies  have  the  distribution  fm(x), 
where x is the hierarchy number;   
When  a  hierarchy  is  selected,  for  each  ‘object’  in  it,  the  probability  of  being 
selected has distribution fw (x), where x refers to the frequency rank of words at 
that hierarchy. During every selection, the frequency rank of each word remains 
unchanged. 
For each hierarchy, the probability of being selected has distribution fc (x), where 
x is the hierarchy.   

The process of selecting objects follows two steps: first selecting the hierarchy, and 

then selecting the objects within this hierarchy. 

For this Hierarchical Selection Model, of our interest is the limit distribution of each 
object’s frequency after repeated selections. We assume that fw at each hierarchy is fixed, 
since fm, fw and fc all show a power-law distribution, the resulting power-law is hence the 
superposition of these power-laws. Does the relationship between word frequency and its 
rank  continue  to  follow  the  power  law  if  the  three  distribution  functions  have  much 
slower  changing  forms  than  the  power  law?  To  this  end,  we  used  the  triangular 
distribution on the fm, fw and fc for simulation, wherein the total number of objects  was 
kept  constant,  and  the  number  of  hierarchies  and  the  ratio  of  maximum  and  minimum 
values  were  changed  systematically  in  these  triangular  distributions.  The  goodness  of 
fitting  the  frequency-  rank  relationship  of  objects  to  power  law  and  the  power-law 

 

6 

exponent were computed.   

The analysis of variance (ANOVA) of the fitting goodness with respect to the number 
of  hierarchy,  fm,  fw,  and  fc  show  that  all  of  their  p-values  are  0.000,  indicating  that  the 
four factors all have a significant effect on the fitting goodness of the power law. When 
the  ratio  between  the  maximum  and  minimum  number  of  objects  at  the  hierarchies  is 
greater  than  3,  as  long  as  the  fc  is  not  a  uniform  distribution,  the  resulting  relationship 
between the frequency and its rank will follow a power-law distribution. 

Of  particular  note  is  that  when  fw  has  a  uniform  distribution,  the  result  can  still 
follow  the  power  law.  Figure  3  shows  the  contour  of  fm  and  fc  on  the  fitting  goodness 
when  fw  has  the  uniform  distribution  and  the  number  of  hierarchy  is  5.  In  many 
conditions,  the  result  can  be  a  power  law.  Figure  4  is  the  curves  of  three  simulation 
results.  It  manifests  the  relation  of  the  object’s  frequency  of  being  chosen  and  its  rank. 
The linear fitness is all good after logarithm (the fitting goodness are 0.8926, 0.9146 and 
0.9275 respectively).

fw has the uniform distribution and the number of hierarchy is 5.Values in this figure are the fitting goodness of power 

law.    Data  at  the  upper  left  part  show  that  in  this  condition,  the  results  still  show  a  power-law  relationship.  This 

indicates  that,  even  if  objects  at  each  hierarchy  are  evenly  selected,  when  the  number  of  objects  differs  across 

hierarchies,  and  the  hierarchy  with  a  smaller  number  of  objects  has  a  bigger  probability  of  being  selected,  the 

frequency-rank result is still in line with the power-law relationship. 

 
In  order  to  examine  the  impact  of  the  number  of  hierarchies,  fm,  fw,  and  fc  on  the 
power-law exponent α, the ANOVA of the power law exponent with respect to the four 
factors is computed. All p-values are 0.000, indicating that each of them has a significant 
effect  on  the  power  law  exponent.  The  regression  analysis  of  power  law  exponent 
exhibits  that fm, fw  and fc all  have  a positive correlation  with α. That is, the  greater the 
degree of non-uniform distribution, the greater its power-law exponent α.

Fig. 4.  Simulation results of the triangular distribution. When the number of hierarchy is 5, the number of objects is 

50000, and the number of repeated selection reaches 2,000,000, the object’s probability of being selected within each 

hierarchy will be uniformly distributed, and the number of objects within each hierarchy and the hierarchy’s probability 

of being selected are both subject to the simulation of triangular distributions. The numbers 5, 7, 9 in this figure are the 

ratios between the maximum and the minimum number of objects within each hierarchy. 

 
The experimental results suggest that when the objects are divided into hierarchies, 
the number of objects in  each hierarchy varies widely, and the hierarchy with a smaller 
number of objects have a larger probability of being selected, even if the objects within a 
same  hierarchy  has  an  equal  probability  of  being  selected,  the  resulting  frequency-rank 
relationship can still follow the power law.    If the hierarchy with the smallest number of 
objects and selection priority is taken  as the highest one (which is same as many social 
and  natural  phenomenon),  the  mechanism  for  the  generating  of  power  law  can  be 
attributed to the existence of hierarchies. We thus suggest that the existence of hierarchies 
and  the  preference  for  top  hierarchy  lead  to  the  power  law.  Previous  research  on  the 
non-linear  growth  of  complex  network [31] suggests that, when the number of network 
nodes increases, if the correspondingly increasing edges have the priority  linear  growth 
(the same as the triangular distribution in this article), then the degree of nodes follows 
the power-law distribution, which is consistent with the conclusion in the current research. 
Importantly, our results not only accounts for the reasons why the degree of nodes in the 
complex network follows the power-law, but also may provide a solid explanation for the 
causes of power laws in the human society. 
 
Further,  we  explored  the  relationship  between  the  exponent  α  and  the  number  of 
hierarchies,  the  number  of  objects  based  on  the  Hierarchy  Selection  Model.  In  the 
simulation  experiment,  fm,  fw  and  fc  were  fixed  as  the  exponential  distributions,  the 
exponential  values  of  their  distributions  were  taken  from  the  corresponding  values  in 
Table  2.  The  number  of  objects  and  the  number  of  hierarchies  were  changed 
systematically, and then we fitted the relationship between the object’s frequency and its 
rank to power law and computed the exponent. The mean of fit goodness is 0.9363 and 
the standard deviation is 0.0204, indicating that the frequency-rank relationship of objects 

 

8 

obeys the power law. The relationship between the power law exponent and the number 
of objects (Fig. 5A) suggests that when the number of hierarchies remain unchanged, the 
more  the  number  of  objects,  the  smaller  the  exponent  α;  Moreover,  the  relationship 
between  the  power  law  exponent  and  the  number  of  hierarchies  (Fig.  5B)  suggests  that 
when the number of objects remains unchanged, the more the hierarchies, the bigger the 
exponent  α  will  be.  In  short,  the  power  law  exponent  manifests  the  bias  degree  of 
“abilities” that all the objects in the system have.

objects, the smaller the power-law index α, and vice versa. B. The power-law exponent as the monotonic function the 

number of hierarchies, each curve represents the α of various numbers of objects. That is, when the number of objects

If  the  topic  of  a  discourse  has  changed  during  the  information  flow,  the  simulation 
results are effective in  predicting  the  changes in  the exponents: the beginning of a new 
topic does not significantly increase the number of words (Table 2 shows the majority of 
words  in  the  new  topic  are  topic-free  words,  that  is,  the  same  words  with  the  original 
topic), but heightens the number of hierarchies, which increases the power law exponent 
α (Fig. 5B). If a speech contains many different topics, then its power law exponent will 
rise  significantly.  For  example,  the  language  of  the  fragmented  discourse  schizophrenia 
has such features, thus their power law exponent α is relatively higher [32]. A large text 
generally involves a diversity of topics, such that it has a larger power-law exponent. This 
is congruent with the predictions of the “Hierarchical Selection Model”, and also broadly 
in line with the data in Table 1. 
 
4  The applications of Hierarchical Selection Model   

 
Among  most  of  the  already  found  power-law  phenomena  in  nature  or  society,  one 
property is shared: there exist hierarchies, and the top hierarchy is  always preferentially 
selected.  For  instance,  a  couple  of  cities  in  one  country,  with  better  conditions  and 
resources,  are  widely  preferred  as  ideal  places  for  career  and  inhabitation;  Likewise,  a

small  number  of  journal  articles,  with  their  highest  academic  values,  are  frequently 
quoted  by  scientists  in  various  fields  of  research.  The  simulation  results  based  on  our 
model suggest that the existence of hierarchical structures and human’s preference for top 
hierarchy lead to the power law. Table 3 lists the power-law phenomena with hierarchical 
structures, and  their  explanations  on the basis of  the Hierarchical  Selection Model. The 
model elements and the corresponding phenomena are also included.

As it can be seen, the number of objects at each hierarchy is unequal, the higher the 
hierarchy,  the  smaller  the  number  of  objects.  Further,  since  man’s  preference  for 
excellence  is  in  accord  with  the  ordinal  level  of  hierarchies,  and  thus  the  higher  the 
hierarchy,  the  higher  the  probability  of  being  selected  for  the  objects  at  that  hierarchy. 
This  account  satisfies  the  conditions  for  the  generating  of  power  law  suggested  by  the 
‘Hierarchical Selection Model’.   

The existence of hierarchies and the pursuit of top hierarchy lead to the power law in 
various  natural  and  social  phenomena.  This  suggests,  albeit  it  might  not  be  the 
fundamental  mechanism  for  the  generating  of  power  law,  compared  with  preexisting 
models, the Hierarchical Selection Model enjoys more universal and explanatory power.

5  Discussion and conclusion 

 
The  word  frequency  and  its  rank  in  natural  texts  follow  the  power  law  (in  special 
cases  referred  as  Zipf’s  Law),  and  its  underlying  mechanism,  as  well  as  that  of  some 
social  phenomena,  is  suggested  as  follows:  ‘objects’  are  hierarchical,  such  that  each 
hierarchy  represents  the  object's  ‘ability’  or  comprehensive  power  of  ’abilities’,  and 
different hierarchy contains a different number of ‘objects’, the hierarchy with a smaller 
number of objects has a bigger probability of being selected.  Essentially, the power law 
exponent  represents  the  bias  level  of  object’s  abilities,  and  a  statistical  performance  of 
hierarchies. 

As  the  power  law  means  a  non-uniform  distribution,  an  excessive  degree  of 
non-uniformity  may  be  largely  undesirable  in  some  circumstances,  such  as  the 
over-concentration  of  urban  population,  monopolization  from  several  large  companies, 
discrepancy  of  personal  wealth.  Then  how  to  manipulate  the  degree  of  non-uniformity, 
that is, the power law exponent α? Simulation results in the present study point out that 
some  fundamental  measures  can  be  taken  to  eliminate  the  power  laws  or  decrease  the 
power  law  exponent  α,  for  instance,  reducing  the  gap  between  objects’  probability  of 
being selected at a same hierarchy, or decreasing the gap between hierarchies’ probability 
of  being  selected  so  as  to  undermine  man’s  irrational  pursuit  of  high  hierarchy  by 
diversifying  the  value  orientations.  Take  the  over  concentration  of  urban  population  for 
an example, the “power” of cosmopolitans at the highest hierarchy can be divided, such 
that  the  economic,  political,  cultural,  and  transportation  centers  will  be  scattered  to 
different  cities,  whereas  the  cities  at  a  lower  hierarchy  can  be  diversified  by  adding 
natural and cultural charms, decreasing the living cost and some others, to weaken man’s 
single desire for the highest hierarchy. 

We caution that for some other scale-rank relationships, such as the earthquake size, 
the moon craters, solar flares, the number of species and etc, the ‘Hierarchical Selection 
Model’  is  still  rather  under-qualified  to  provide  explanations,  and  needs  to  be  further 
developed. 

To  conclude,  the  power  law  is  generated  due  to  the  ability-based  hierarchies  of 
objects,  and  human’s  single  pursuit  of  highest  hierarchy.  In  human  society,  the  social 
order  and  value  system  give  birth  to  the  general  hierarchical  structures,  and  facilitate 
man’s constant and consistent pursuit of highest hierarchy, such that the power laws are 
ubiquitous in the world, particularly in human society.
