Abstract

Dialogue Act (DA) tagging is crucial for spoken language understanding systems, as it provides
a general representation of speakers’ intents, not bound to a particular dialogue system. Unfor-
tunately, publicly available data sets with DA annotation are all based on different annotation
schemes and thus incompatible with each other. Moreover, their schemes often do not cover
all aspects necessary for open-domain human-machine interaction. In this paper, we propose a
methodology to map several publicly available corpora to a subset of the ISO standard, in order
to create a large task-independent training corpus for DA classiﬁcation. We show the feasibility
of using this corpus to train a domain-independent DA tagger testing it on out-of-domain con-
versational data, and argue the importance of training on multiple corpora to achieve robustness
across different DA categories.

1 Introduction

The correct interpretation of the intents behind a speaker’s utterances plays an essential role in determin-
ing the success of a dialogue. Hence, the module responsible for intents classiﬁcation lies at the very
core of many dialogue systems, both in research and industry (e.g. Alexa, Siri). Moreover, although
the task of intent recognition is traditionally linked to task-based systems, recently it has also proved
crucial for non task-based conversational systems. According to the results of the Amazon Alexa Prize
challenge (Ram et al., 2017), the most successful conversational systems in the competition relied on a
strong spoken language understanding module, while more than 60% of the approaches explicitly used
intents.

Nevertheless, automatic intent recognition is hard, since participants’ intents in a dialogue are im-
plicit. Intent classiﬁcation has therefore been mostly modeled as a supervised machine learning prob-
lem (Gupta et al., 2006; Xu and Sarikaya, 2013; Yang et al., 2017), with the consequent deﬁnition of
intents taxonomies. Over time this led to the creation of expensive annotated resources (Price, 1990;
Henderson et al., 2014) with the related time-consuming design of multiple intent schemes.
In most
cases, however, intents taxonomies are deﬁned speciﬁcally for a given application or a dataset and are
not generalizable to other systems or tasks, making these resources difﬁcult to reuse (e.g. the popular Air
Travel Information Services (ATIS) corpus include heavily domain-dependent intents such as Airfare or
Ground Service).

Dialogue Acts (DA), also known as speech or communicative acts, represent an attempt to create a
formalized and generalized version of intents. As such, DAs have been investigated by the research
community for many years (Stolcke et al., 2000) and have been applied successfully to many tasks.
In particular, their aspiration to generality makes them an appealing option for non task-based ap-
plication (e.g. more than 20% of the teams in Amazon Alexa Prize Challenge explicitly used DAs
(Cervone et al., 2017; Bowden et al., 2017), including the winning team (Fang et al., 2017)). Also, in
the case of DAs, over the years there have been several efforts to produce publicly available annotated

resources (Godfrey et al., 1992; Carletta, 2006; Alexandersson et al., 1998) to train DA taggers. The DA
taxonomies created for these resources, albeit arguably more general compared to corpora like ATIS (for
example utilizing categories such as wh-questions), are still dataset speciﬁc; since many of these schemes
lack coverage of some crucial aspects of dialogic interaction. Furthermore, given that all these datasets
utilize different schemes, these resources are hardly compatible.

The ISO 24617-2 (Bunt et al., 2010; Bunt et al., 2012), the international ISO standard for DA an-
notation, represents the ﬁrst attempt to create a truly domain and task independent scheme. Given
its holistic approach compared to previous schemes, ISO 24617-2 can be used as a lingua franca for
cross-corpora DA mapping, as conﬁrmed by successful attempts to remap single corpora to the standard
(Chowdhury et al., 2016; Fang et al., 2012).

However, there is no reference training set for the standard, since the only public resource currently
available with ISO 24617-2 annotation (DialogBank, (Bunt et al., 2016)) is too small to be used to train
classiﬁers. Therefore, most DA tagging research still focuses on in-domain studies on large datasets with
incompatible DA annotations (Stolcke et al., 2000; Ji et al., 2016). Moreover, most publicly available
corpora are imbalanced with respect to the distribution of various DA dimensions such as Information
Transfer (e.g. “What’s your favourite book?”) or Action Discussion (e.g. “Tell me the news.”), which
are required for successful open-domain conversational systems.

In this work, we show how to reuse and combine publicly available annotated resources to create a
large training corpus for domain-independent DA tagging experiments. We map different corpora using
an ISO standard compliant DA taxonomy, following the previous research on the topic (Fang et al., 2012;
Petukhova et al., 2014b) and we share this resource with the research community.1

In order to investigate the soundness of our approach compared to in-domain models we further exper-
iment with domain-independent DA tagging. As previously done in the literature we cast the Dialogue
Act tagging task as a supervised multi-class classiﬁcation problem using Support Vector Machines. The
correctness of the approach is ﬁrst tested on the de facto DA tagging standard – the Switchboard (SWDA)
corpus (Godfrey et al., 1992), using the reference training and test sets and achieving performance com-
parable to the state-of-the-art approaches. Secondly, we experiment with domain-independent DA tag-
ging following the same approach and using our combined resource as a training corpus. The DialogBank
corpus, that represents a reference manual DA annotation for the ISO standard, is used for the evaluation
of the tagger. To the best of our knowledge this is the ﬁrst attempt to test automatic DA annotation on
this corpus.

The domain-independence and suitability of the tagger for conversational systems trained on multiple
resources is additionally evaluated on two other corpora annotated following our optimized taxonomy
(human-machine conversations from the Amazon Alexa Prize Challenge). The performances achieved on
these three datasets suggest that the training on multiple corpora represents a step forward for DA tagging
of open-domain non task-based human-machine conversations. Finally, we present experiments to in-
vestigate the contribution of the different corpora to the performance of the classiﬁers. The results of our
experiments show the importance of utilizing multiple resources to achieve a sound performance across
different types of DA categories. The multi-domain DA tagger presented here was successfully employed
in Roving Mind, our open-domain conversational system for the Alexa Prize (Cervone et al., 2017).

2 State of the Art

2.1 Dialogue Act Annotation Schemes

The notion of Dialogue Acts can be traced back to the one of illocutionary acts introduced by
(Austin and Urmson, 1962). The illocutionary act represents a level of description of an utterance’s
meaning that goes beyond the purely semantic level (“Is the window open?”) to encompass the intent of
the speaker in producing that utterance (“Please, close the window.”).

One of

the task-based corpus MapTask
(Anderson et al., 1991) in the early nineties. The MapTask scheme distinguishes between initiating

the ﬁrst DA taxonomies was the one created for

moves – such as giving instructions, explaining, checking information or asking questions – and response
moves – for example acknowledging instructions, answering questions and clarifying information. The
corpus also makes a distinction regarding the grammatical and semantic structure of the interactions,
classifying, for example wh-questions, yn-questions and positive/negative answers. Although pioneering
at the time, the MapTask annotation scheme is very speciﬁc to the described scenario, and some of its
instruct, clarify, check) do not scale well to generic, non task-based conversations. More-
DAs (e.g.
over, its taxonomy was not designed to capture all human behaviours during conversations, and, as a
consequence, its coverage for labelling a non task-based interaction is inadequate.

The ﬁrst attempt to deﬁne a uniﬁed, non task-based standard for DA tagging was the Discourse
Annotation and Markup System of Labeling (DAMSL) (Core and Allen, 1997) tag-set for the SWDA
(Godfrey et al., 1992) corpus. This annotation scheme proposes a taxonomy of 42 tags, describing
both semantic aspects of conversation (opinion, non-opinion, preference, etc.), syntactic aspects (yn-
questions, wh-questions, declarative questions, etc.) and behaviours related to the dialogue (conven-
tional closing, hedge, backchanneling, etc.). Nevertheless, the taxonomy still has some issues: tags are
mutually exclusive (making it impossible to annotate, for example, a no answer which was also signaling
non-understanding) and are organised in a ﬂat taxonomy, which does not take into account similarities
and differences between the tags.

Bunt (1999) introduced the Dynamic Interpretation Theory (DIT) for dialogues, setting the theoretical
foundation for a domain-independent and task-independent DA taxonomy. The paper introduced some
very important concepts like the idea of multidimensionality of DAs and the distinction between Action-
Discussion, a macro-category of DAs encompassing cases in which interlocutors negotiate actions to be
performed (e.g. requests like “Let’s switch topic.”), and Information-Transfer interactions, capturing the
DAs through which speakers exchange information (e.g. sharing personal information like “My name is
John.”). The DIT++ taxonomy (Bunt, 2009) was then deﬁned in 2009 with the aim of providing a unique
and universally recognized standard for DA annotation based on the theoretical ideas introduced in the
DIT scheme. Its ﬁfth version was accepted as ISO 24617-2.

The core aspects of the ISO standard are its multidimensionality and its domain and task independence.
The ISO scheme is multidimensional in the sense that it makes a clear distinction between semantic
dimensions (i.e. the aspect of the communication which the DA describes) and communicative functions
(i.e. the illocutionary act performed within that dimension). In this way, ambiguities between various
aspects of the communication and overlapping between DAs are removed. Furthermore, the scheme
contains a generic dimension and communicative functions, which is suitable for mapping virtually any
kind of conversation, both task-based and non task-based. Moreover, its multidimensional aspect and
hierarchical taxonomy make it extensible and potentially adaptable to speciﬁc conversational sets.

2.2 Dialogue Act Tagging

The automatic recognition of Dialogue Acts has been addressed by the literature using various ma-
chine learning techniques.
In particular DA classiﬁcation has been modeled both as a sequence la-
beling problem, using techniques such as HMM (Stolcke et al., 2000), neural networks (Ji et al., 2016;
Kumar et al., 2017) or CRF (Quarteroni et al., 2011), and as a multi-class classiﬁcation problem, using
for example SVM (Quarteroni and Riccardi, 2010). Mentioning and comparing all DA classiﬁcation ap-
proaches is difﬁcult because of the differences in annotation schemes and datasets used. All approaches,
however, are usually tested on in-domain data.

One of the most popular datasets for benchmarking is SWDA (Godfrey et al., 1992), a dataset of
human-human open-domain telephone conversations. The state-of-the-art on SWDA (77.0% accuracy
on 42 DA tags) was achieved by (Ji et al., 2016) using deep neural networks.

The ISO standard (Bunt et al., 2010) can be seen as a generalization of all these annotation schemes.

However, there is no available training data for the ISO standard.

3 Data Sets

3.1 Training sets

The scarcity of resources of adequate size annotated with the ISO standard makes it difﬁcult to train a
DA tagger for this taxonomy. To the best of our knowledge, the DBOX corpus (Petukhova et al., 2014a)
– the only resource manually annotated using the ISO standard – is not yet publicly available . The best
possible approach given the current availability of data is to map existing corpora’s DA schemes to the
ISO scheme. Given the limited – and often domain-dependent – annotation scheme of these resources,
it is impossible to map enough data to train a DA tagger for the full ISO taxonomy, since some of the
ISO dialogue acts have no correspondence in any of the considered corpora. Therefore, we opted for a
reduced version of the taxonomy, limiting our research to subsets of the General (Task), Social Obligation
Management and Feedback dimensions. So far, we mapped the following ﬁve different corpora to our
scheme:

SWDA: The Switchboard corpus (Godfrey et al., 1992) is a dataset of transcribed open-domain tele-
phone conversations. The Switchboard Dialogue Act Corpus (SWDA) is a subset of the Switchboard
corpus annotated with DAs. SWDA represents a logical choice when building a training set for a
domain-independent DA tagger, as it is a large collection of open-domain, non task-based conversa-
tions, and therefore provides a natural similarity to the conversational domain of social bots. Moreover,
there are already examples in literature of mappings from the Switchboard corpus to the ISO standard
(Fang et al., 2012). As visible from Figure 3.1, drawbacks of the corpus with respect to the task in-
clude its unbalancedness (60% of utterances are Information-providing) and lack of Action-Discussion
interactions (less than 1% of overall corpus).

AMI: This corpus contains transcriptions from 100 hours of meeting recordings of the European-
funded AMI project (FP6-506811), a consortium dedicated to the research and development of technol-
ogy (Carletta, 2006). This dataset presents a reasonably balanced collection of utterances and a taxon-
omy which shares some similarities with the ISO standard (e.g. distinction between Action-discussion
and Information-transfer). Drawbacks of the corpus include the fact that there are multiple speakers (it
is therefore more difﬁcult to capture contextual information) and sometimes its scheme does not map to
the leaves of the ISO tree.

MapTask: This is a task-based dialogue corpus collected by the HCRC at the University of Edinburgh
(Anderson et al., 1991). Dialogues involve two participants, one with an empty map and one with a route-
marked map which must instruct the other speaker to draw the same route. The corpus was chosen due to
its abundance of Action-discussion interactions (more than 30% of the overall corpus), which are often
lacking in other corpora.

VerbMobil: This is a collection of task-based dialogues released in 1997 (Burger et al., 2000). A
subset of these dialogues is annotated with DAs (Alexandersson et al., 1998). The scenario involves two
speakers, which play respectively the roles of a travel agent and of a client. The client usually provides a
set of constraints and requests to be satisﬁed, while the traveling agent has to ask questions and provide
information in order to satisfy the client’s requests. Interactions happening within the VerbMobil 2 corpus
closely resemble those usually seen with personal assistants, with a user looking for the fulﬁllment of a
task and a serving agent interacting with the user to solve his/her issues making it an appealing addition
to our training set.

BT Oasis: The BT Oasis corpus is a collection of task-based conversations involving personal as-
sistance for clients of the British Telecom services (Leech and Weisser, 2003). The conversations are
human-to-human, and usually involve a user who has a problem to solve and an assistant who helps the
user solving his issues. The BT Oasis corpus was chosen as part of the training set for its interesting
scheme, called SPAAC (Speech Act Annotation scheme for Corpora), which is easily mappable to the
ISO standard due to its clear separation of grammatical and illocutionary act.

3.2 Test sets

DialogBank (DB): the DialogBank (Bunt et al., 2016) is a corpus2 annotated with ISO 24617-2 which
currently contains 15 English dialogues: 3 from MapTask and 3 from TRAINS (Traum, 1996) (both
task-based), 5 from DBOX (games collected in a Wizard-of-Oz fashion) and 4 from Switchboard (open-
domain human-human conversation). Overall there are 1,596 DAs. The corpus currently represents the
only publicly available resource manually annotated using the ISO standard.

Common Alexa Prize Conversations (CAPC): The CAPC corpus (Ram et al., 2017) is a dataset of
3,764 anonymised individual user turns pooled from different users interacting with all socialbots partic-
ipating in the Alexa Prize. We have extracted a balanced subset of 458 turns and have annotated it with
DAs from our adapted version of the ISO standard by 3 annotators, with an inter-annotator agreement of
κ = 0.82. CAPC exempliﬁes frequent user interaction data not biased by the interaction with one social-
bot in particular. Another advantage of this dataset is that it is balanced across different DA categories.
One drawback is that no interaction context (previous DA) is available for the individual turns.

Socialbot Logs (S-Logs): S-Logs is a dataset of 13 open-domain conversations that different native
American English speakers had with one of the socialbots of the Alexa Prize Challenge 2017. Overall
this dataset contains 310 machine DAs and 165 user DAs. Two annotators tagged this dataset with DAs
from our adapted version of ISO 24617-2, with an inter-annotator agreement of κ = 0.81. While we have
annotated both machine and user turns, we test only on the latter and exploit machine turns as features
for our classiﬁcation experiments.

4 Methodology

4.1 Preprocessing

Before mapping the DA schemes of the corpora to the ISO subset scheme, a series of preprocessing
steps have been performed to obtain a uniform training resource with the same surface text features
as the testing corpora, since in S-Logs data, user input is lowercased and the punctuation is limited to
apostrophes. More speciﬁcally, the text has been lowercased (including any named entity appearing in
the original transcription and excluding the ‘I’ pronoun), punctuation has been removed (except for the
apostrophe character in contracted expressions like “let’s” and “can’t”) and any special characters have
been deleted from the utterances. Moreover, any information regarding prosody has been removed, since
this feature is not available in our test sets.

For experiments on the SWDA DAMSL corpus we recreated the same setting described in
(Stolcke et al., 2000), using the same train and test set and preprocessing the corpus in the same way
following the WS97 manual annotator guidelines (Jurafsky, 1997).

4.2 Dialogue Act scheme and mapping

The Socialbot scheme (S-scheme), the DA scheme used during the classiﬁcation experiments, is a
subset of the ofﬁcial ISO standard. Only three dimensions out of the ofﬁcial eight deﬁned in the standard
are considered (Task, Social Obligation Management and Feedback), and some of the communicative
functions are generalized with an higher level of the tree.

Figure 4.2 shows the labeled subset of the ISO standard taxonomy for the General-purpose functions
(i.e. functions independent from any given dimensions), while table 1 shows the correspondence for
dimension-speciﬁc functions. The main difference between the DA scheme labeled in this work and
the complete ISO taxonomy is the lack of further speciﬁcation for the Inform, Commissive and Direc-
tive tags. This is due to the fact that most of the DA schemes used when building the training set do
not provide contextual information detailed enough to label these tags accurately. Moreover, there is
confusion and discrepancies about when these contextual DA should be used, even in the ofﬁcial ISO
guidelines. Indeed, in (Fang et al., 2012), which provides the ofﬁcial mapping from Switchboard to the
ISO standard, it is reported that some contextual DA tags (for example other answer) do not have a di-
rect mapping to the standard. This becomes even more problematic considering that among the training
resources there are corpora like AMI, MapTask or VerbMobil, which label answers as Informs, which
would make training data for this class extremely noisy. A similar argument can be raised on the lower
leaves of the Directive and Commissive nodes, some of which are not labeled even in the very detailed
SWDA taxonomy. Mapping of the available corpora to this scheme was done according to the available
documentation in literature.

For the Switchboard corpus, a detailed mapping is provided in (Fang et al., 2012), which was fol-
lowed exactly for the supported dimensions/communicative functions. For MapTask and AMI, there is
already research highlighting similarities and differences between their schemes and the ISO standard
one (Petukhova et al., 2014b). These results do not provide an exact mapping between the two schemes,
which in some cases is impossible: for example the AMI Elicit-inform tag is the equivalent of ISO 24617-

It is frequently the case that DA tags do not map to any leaf-node, e.g. VerbMobil for Task dimension

2’s Question, but will not map to any speciﬁc question type (SetQ, PropQ, ChoiceQ, etc.). Utterances
whose tags cannot be directly mapped to the ISO scheme were dropped and do not appear in the training
set.

Since there is no available literature on mapping the VerbMobil 2 and BT Oasis corpora to the ISO
standard, a speciﬁc mapping was designed from scratch by drawing inspiration from the approaches
available on other corpora.

Table 2 presents counts of the DAs after mapping to our scheme, across all training and testing corpora.

As mentioned in the paper, the corpora present quite imbalanced distributions of DA categories.

5 Experiments and Results

Since, to the best of our knowledge, there is no established state of the art on DialogBank – the only cor-
pus manually annotated following the ISO 24617-2 scheme – we ﬁrst establish the tagging methodology
on the SWDA corpus using the DAMSL 42 tag set and compare it to the state of the art (Ji et al., 2016).
Then, the feature set and the parameters of the best performing models are used for the training of the
DA tagger on the aggregate dataset, considering some of the semantic dimensions and the communica-
tive functions of the ISO 24617-2 . The models are then evaluated on the DialogBank and open-domain
human-machine data from Amazon Alexa Prize Challenge. McNemar’s test (McNemar, 1947) for sta-
tistical signiﬁcance has been used to analyze whether introduced features give a signiﬁcant contribution
to the overall performance.

5.1 Experiments on SWDA

Prior to training the classiﬁcation models, the SWDA (Jurafsky, 1997) utterances are preprocessed fol-
lowing (Stolcke et al., 2000). The dataset is split into training (1,115 dialogues) and test set (19 dia-
logues) following the same paper, and the remaining 21 dialogues are used as development set to tune
the C parameter of Support Vector Machines (SVM) (Vapnik, 1995). For the experiments, we used

opment set by 2 points.3 For comparison, the table also includes majority baseline, the results from

experiment with n-grams (unigrams, bigrams, and trigrams) and previous DA tag features. We do not
consider the unit length feature from (Quarteroni and Riccardi, 2010), since classiﬁcation instances in the
SWDA scheme and ISO 24617-2 are different (slash unit vs. functional unit). The results are reported in
Table 3; since the results reported were obtained with SVM C parameter set to 0.1, they are higher than
the ones reported in (Quarteroni and Riccardi, 2010): e.g. for 1-2-grams 70.0 vs. 71.7.

The ﬁrst observation is that the addition of the previous DA signiﬁcantly improves the performance.
Addition of part-of-speech tags does not yield any improvement; however, when POS-tags are indexed
with their positions in an utterance, accuracy is signiﬁcantly improved and rises to 76.2. Addition of
dependency relations (both with and without indexing with their position) does not improve the perfor-
mance. Addition of the averaged pre-trained word-embedding vectors (from Google News) to the model
with indexed POS-tags, however, rises the accuracy to 76.7. The model with word embeddings comes
0.3 short of the state-of-the-art results reported in (Ji et al., 2016).

5.2 Experiments on Aggregate ISO-standard Data

The methodology established on SWDA is applied to training the ISO 24617-2 subset models using
the aggregate data set. Since in ISO 24617-2 annotation scheme DAs consist of semantic dimensions
and communicative functions, the utterances are ﬁrst classiﬁed into the considered semantic dimensions
– general, social obligations management (SOM), and feedback. Then, we experiment with the Task
dimension, reporting the results without error propagation from the previous step, in order to give the
reader a clearer understanding of the current classiﬁcation capabilities when restricting interactions with
the system to general communicative functions.

5.2.1 Semantic Dimension Classiﬁcation

The results of the binary dimension classiﬁcation models on the test sets – DialogBank (DB), CAPC,
and S-Logs – are reported in Table 4. The CAPC corpus consists of isolated utterances; consequently,
the Feedback dimension is not present. On DB and S-Logs, on the other hand, the Feedback dimension
yields the lowest accuracy in comparison to General and SOM dimension communicative functions. Low
performances on the Feedback dimension could be explained by the fact that the training data mostly
contains Allo-feedback and lacks Auto-feedback and Feedback elicitations, which are present in DB.

5.2.2 Communicative Function Classiﬁcation

The utterances are further classiﬁed into communicative functions of the General (Task) dimension, using
the methodology established on SWDA, i.e. the same hyper-parameter settings (C = 0.1) and features.
However, since models with dependency relations do not yield statistically signiﬁcant differences, they
are also considered. The results of the models on the test sets are reported in Table 5. The behavior of the
models trained with various feature combinations is in-line with the SWDA experiments: the addition
of the previous DA tags and part-of-speech tags indexed with their positions in a sentence improves the
performance. Different from the SWDA, the addition of the indexed dependency relations improves the
performance on the test sets. In the case of DialogBank and CAPC, their contribution is statistically
signiﬁcant. Additionally, unlike for SWDA, the addition of word embeddings with and without index
dependency relation (I-DEP) does not produce signiﬁcant improvements for all but CAPC. Consequently,
the model trained on 1-2-grams, previous DA tags, indexed POS-tags and dependency relations is chosen
for the ablation study.

5.2.3 Corpora Combinations

The aggregation of all the corpora mapped to our subset of ISO 24617-2 is not necessarily the best one, as
the distributions of DA categories varies from corpus to corpus. Consequently, we also present results on
the test sets for the models trained solely on SWDA and AMI; as well as perform an ablation experiment
removing one corpus at a time. The best performing model from the previous subsection (1-2-grams,
previous DA-tag, indexed POS-tags, and indexed dependency relations) is used for the study. The results
of these experiments are reported in Table 6.

While the best results for Dialog Bank are achieved considering all the corpora, for CAPC the best
results are achieved by removing MapTask. For S-Logs, on the other hand, the best performing corpora
combination is all except VerbMobil. However, the performance differences from the models trained
on all corpora are not statistically signiﬁcant. Training DA taggers solely on SWDA and AMI – the
largest and the most diverse corpora – yields performances inferior to the combination of all the corpora.
From the table, we can also observe that these two corpora – SWDA and AMI – contribute most to
the performance, as removing them affects the performance the most. On the other hand, removing the
smaller datasets – BT Oasis, MapTask, and VerbMobil – affects the performance less.

of our approach on both in-domain and out-of-domain datasets, proving that the described DA tagging
technique is indeed independent from the underlying scheme and task of the annotated corpora. Fi-
nally, the machine learning technique used for DA tagging was tested on a popular DA tagging task (the
Switchboard corpus), obtaining very close to state-of-the-art results.

This work represents one of the ﬁrst attempts to use an ISO compliant DA scheme for a real-life ap-
plication, as well as one of the ﬁrst structured approaches for evaluation of dialogue resources annotated
with this taxonomy.

Research on available training resources is one of the ﬁrst things to look forward to, since the current
data proved to be effective, but also presented numerous drawbacks (lack of adequate coverage for the
Feedback dimension, imbalanced DAs, lack of context-aware communicative functions). We plan to
make our resource continue to grow in the future by adding and mapping additional corpora, such as the
MRDA (Shriberg et al., 2004) corpus.

Abstract

Dialogue Act (DA) tagging is crucial for spoken language understanding systems, as it provides
a general representation of speakers’ intents, not bound to a particular dialogue system. Unfor-
tunately, publicly available data sets with DA annotation are all based on different annotation
schemes and thus incompatible with each other. Moreover, their schemes often do not cover
all aspects necessary for open-domain human-machine interaction. In this paper, we propose a
methodology to map several publicly available corpora to a subset of the ISO standard, in order
to create a large task-independent training corpus for DA classiﬁcation. We show the feasibility
of using this corpus to train a domain-independent DA tagger testing it on out-of-domain con-
versational data, and argue the importance of training on multiple corpora to achieve robustness
across different DA categories.

1 Introduction

The correct interpretation of the intents behind a speaker’s utterances plays an essential role in determin-
ing the success of a dialogue. Hence, the module responsible for intents classiﬁcation lies at the very
core of many dialogue systems, both in research and industry (e.g. Alexa, Siri). Moreover, although
the task of intent recognition is traditionally linked to task-based systems, recently it has also proved
crucial for non task-based conversational systems. According to the results of the Amazon Alexa Prize
challenge (Ram et al., 2017), the most successful conversational systems in the competition relied on a
strong spoken language understanding module, while more than 60% of the approaches explicitly used
intents.

Nevertheless, automatic intent recognition is hard, since participants’ intents in a dialogue are im-
plicit. Intent classiﬁcation has therefore been mostly modeled as a supervised machine learning prob-
lem (Gupta et al., 2006; Xu and Sarikaya, 2013; Yang et al., 2017), with the consequent deﬁnition of
intents taxonomies. Over time this led to the creation of expensive annotated resources (Price, 1990;
Henderson et al., 2014) with the related time-consuming design of multiple intent schemes.
In most
cases, however, intents taxonomies are deﬁned speciﬁcally for a given application or a dataset and are
not generalizable to other systems or tasks, making these resources difﬁcult to reuse (e.g. the popular Air
Travel Information Services (ATIS) corpus include heavily domain-dependent intents such as Airfare or
Ground Service).

Dialogue Acts (DA), also known as speech or communicative acts, represent an attempt to create a
formalized and generalized version of intents. As such, DAs have been investigated by the research
community for many years (Stolcke et al., 2000) and have been applied successfully to many tasks.
In particular, their aspiration to generality makes them an appealing option for non task-based ap-
plication (e.g. more than 20% of the teams in Amazon Alexa Prize Challenge explicitly used DAs
(Cervone et al., 2017; Bowden et al., 2017), including the winning team (Fang et al., 2017)). Also, in
the case of DAs, over the years there have been several efforts to produce publicly available annotated

resources (Godfrey et al., 1992; Carletta, 2006; Alexandersson et al., 1998) to train DA taggers. The DA
taxonomies created for these resources, albeit arguably more general compared to corpora like ATIS (for
example utilizing categories such as wh-questions), are still dataset speciﬁc; since many of these schemes
lack coverage of some crucial aspects of dialogic interaction. Furthermore, given that all these datasets
utilize different schemes, these resources are hardly compatible.

The ISO 24617-2 (Bunt et al., 2010; Bunt et al., 2012), the international ISO standard for DA an-
notation, represents the ﬁrst attempt to create a truly domain and task independent scheme. Given
its holistic approach compared to previous schemes, ISO 24617-2 can be used as a lingua franca for
cross-corpora DA mapping, as conﬁrmed by successful attempts to remap single corpora to the standard
(Chowdhury et al., 2016; Fang et al., 2012).

However, there is no reference training set for the standard, since the only public resource currently
available with ISO 24617-2 annotation (DialogBank, (Bunt et al., 2016)) is too small to be used to train
classiﬁers. Therefore, most DA tagging research still focuses on in-domain studies on large datasets with
incompatible DA annotations (Stolcke et al., 2000; Ji et al., 2016). Moreover, most publicly available
corpora are imbalanced with respect to the distribution of various DA dimensions such as Information
Transfer (e.g. “What’s your favourite book?”) or Action Discussion (e.g. “Tell me the news.”), which
are required for successful open-domain conversational systems.

In this work, we show how to reuse and combine publicly available annotated resources to create a
large training corpus for domain-independent DA tagging experiments. We map different corpora using
an ISO standard compliant DA taxonomy, following the previous research on the topic (Fang et al., 2012;
Petukhova et al., 2014b) and we share this resource with the research community.1

In order to investigate the soundness of our approach compared to in-domain models we further exper-
iment with domain-independent DA tagging. As previously done in the literature we cast the Dialogue
Act tagging task as a supervised multi-class classiﬁcation problem using Support Vector Machines. The
correctness of the approach is ﬁrst tested on the de facto DA tagging standard – the Switchboard (SWDA)
corpus (Godfrey et al., 1992), using the reference training and test sets and achieving performance com-
parable to the state-of-the-art approaches. Secondly, we experiment with domain-independent DA tag-
ging following the same approach and using our combined resource as a training corpus. The DialogBank
corpus, that represents a reference manual DA annotation for the ISO standard, is used for the evaluation
of the tagger. To the best of our knowledge this is the ﬁrst attempt to test automatic DA annotation on
this corpus.

The domain-independence and suitability of the tagger for conversational systems trained on multiple
resources is additionally evaluated on two other corpora annotated following our optimized taxonomy
(human-machine conversations from the Amazon Alexa Prize Challenge). The performances achieved on
these three datasets suggest that the training on multiple corpora represents a step forward for DA tagging
of open-domain non task-based human-machine conversations. Finally, we present experiments to in-
vestigate the contribution of the different corpora to the performance of the classiﬁers. The results of our
experiments show the importance of utilizing multiple resources to achieve a sound performance across
different types of DA categories. The multi-domain DA tagger presented here was successfully employed
in Roving Mind, our open-domain conversational system for the Alexa Prize (Cervone et al., 2017).

2 State of the Art

2.1 Dialogue Act Annotation Schemes

The notion of Dialogue Acts can be traced back to the one of illocutionary acts introduced by
(Austin and Urmson, 1962). The illocutionary act represents a level of description of an utterance’s
meaning that goes beyond the purely semantic level (“Is the window open?”) to encompass the intent of
the speaker in producing that utterance (“Please, close the window.”).

One of

the task-based corpus MapTask
(Anderson et al., 1991) in the early nineties. The MapTask scheme distinguishes between initiating

the ﬁrst DA taxonomies was the one created for

moves – such as giving instructions, explaining, checking information or asking questions – and response
moves – for example acknowledging instructions, answering questions and clarifying information. The
corpus also makes a distinction regarding the grammatical and semantic structure of the interactions,
classifying, for example wh-questions, yn-questions and positive/negative answers. Although pioneering
at the time, the MapTask annotation scheme is very speciﬁc to the described scenario, and some of its
instruct, clarify, check) do not scale well to generic, non task-based conversations. More-
DAs (e.g.
over, its taxonomy was not designed to capture all human behaviours during conversations, and, as a
consequence, its coverage for labelling a non task-based interaction is inadequate.

The ﬁrst attempt to deﬁne a uniﬁed, non task-based standard for DA tagging was the Discourse
Annotation and Markup System of Labeling (DAMSL) (Core and Allen, 1997) tag-set for the SWDA
(Godfrey et al., 1992) corpus. This annotation scheme proposes a taxonomy of 42 tags, describing
both semantic aspects of conversation (opinion, non-opinion, preference, etc.), syntactic aspects (yn-
questions, wh-questions, declarative questions, etc.) and behaviours related to the dialogue (conven-
tional closing, hedge, backchanneling, etc.). Nevertheless, the taxonomy still has some issues: tags are
mutually exclusive (making it impossible to annotate, for example, a no answer which was also signaling
non-understanding) and are organised in a ﬂat taxonomy, which does not take into account similarities
and differences between the tags.

Bunt (1999) introduced the Dynamic Interpretation Theory (DIT) for dialogues, setting the theoretical
foundation for a domain-independent and task-independent DA taxonomy. The paper introduced some
very important concepts like the idea of multidimensionality of DAs and the distinction between Action-
Discussion, a macro-category of DAs encompassing cases in which interlocutors negotiate actions to be
performed (e.g. requests like “Let’s switch topic.”), and Information-Transfer interactions, capturing the
DAs through which speakers exchange information (e.g. sharing personal information like “My name is
John.”). The DIT++ taxonomy (Bunt, 2009) was then deﬁned in 2009 with the aim of providing a unique
and universally recognized standard for DA annotation based on the theoretical ideas introduced in the
DIT scheme. Its ﬁfth version was accepted as ISO 24617-2.

The core aspects of the ISO standard are its multidimensionality and its domain and task independence.
The ISO scheme is multidimensional in the sense that it makes a clear distinction between semantic
dimensions (i.e. the aspect of the communication which the DA describes) and communicative functions
(i.e. the illocutionary act performed within that dimension). In this way, ambiguities between various
aspects of the communication and overlapping between DAs are removed. Furthermore, the scheme
contains a generic dimension and communicative functions, which is suitable for mapping virtually any
kind of conversation, both task-based and non task-based. Moreover, its multidimensional aspect and
hierarchical taxonomy make it extensible and potentially adaptable to speciﬁc conversational sets.

2.2 Dialogue Act Tagging

The automatic recognition of Dialogue Acts has been addressed by the literature using various ma-
chine learning techniques.
In particular DA classiﬁcation has been modeled both as a sequence la-
beling problem, using techniques such as HMM (Stolcke et al., 2000), neural networks (Ji et al., 2016;
Kumar et al., 2017) or CRF (Quarteroni et al., 2011), and as a multi-class classiﬁcation problem, using
for example SVM (Quarteroni and Riccardi, 2010). Mentioning and comparing all DA classiﬁcation ap-
proaches is difﬁcult because of the differences in annotation schemes and datasets used. All approaches,
however, are usually tested on in-domain data.

One of the most popular datasets for benchmarking is SWDA (Godfrey et al., 1992), a dataset of
human-human open-domain telephone conversations. The state-of-the-art on SWDA (77.0% accuracy
on 42 DA tags) was achieved by (Ji et al., 2016) using deep neural networks.

The ISO standard (Bunt et al., 2010) can be seen as a generalization of all these annotation schemes.

However, there is no available training data for the ISO standard.

3 Data Sets

3.1 Training sets

The scarcity of resources of adequate size annotated with the ISO standard makes it difﬁcult to train a
DA tagger for this taxonomy. To the best of our knowledge, the DBOX corpus (Petukhova et al., 2014a)
– the only resource manually annotated using the ISO standard – is not yet publicly available . The best
possible approach given the current availability of data is to map existing corpora’s DA schemes to the
ISO scheme. Given the limited – and often domain-dependent – annotation scheme of these resources,
it is impossible to map enough data to train a DA tagger for the full ISO taxonomy, since some of the
ISO dialogue acts have no correspondence in any of the considered corpora. Therefore, we opted for a
reduced version of the taxonomy, limiting our research to subsets of the General (Task), Social Obligation
Management and Feedback dimensions. So far, we mapped the following ﬁve different corpora to our
scheme:

SWDA: The Switchboard corpus (Godfrey et al., 1992) is a dataset of transcribed open-domain tele-
phone conversations. The Switchboard Dialogue Act Corpus (SWDA) is a subset of the Switchboard
corpus annotated with DAs. SWDA represents a logical choice when building a training set for a
domain-independent DA tagger, as it is a large collection of open-domain, non task-based conversa-
tions, and therefore provides a natural similarity to the conversational domain of social bots. Moreover,
there are already examples in literature of mappings from the Switchboard corpus to the ISO standard
(Fang et al., 2012). As visible from Figure 3.1, drawbacks of the corpus with respect to the task in-
clude its unbalancedness (60% of utterances are Information-providing) and lack of Action-Discussion
interactions (less than 1% of overall corpus).

AMI: This corpus contains transcriptions from 100 hours of meeting recordings of the European-
funded AMI project (FP6-506811), a consortium dedicated to the research and development of technol-
ogy (Carletta, 2006). This dataset presents a reasonably balanced collection of utterances and a taxon-
omy which shares some similarities with the ISO standard (e.g. distinction between Action-discussion
and Information-transfer). Drawbacks of the corpus include the fact that there are multiple speakers (it
is therefore more difﬁcult to capture contextual information) and sometimes its scheme does not map to
the leaves of the ISO tree.

MapTask: This is a task-based dialogue corpus collected by the HCRC at the University of Edinburgh
(Anderson et al., 1991). Dialogues involve two participants, one with an empty map and one with a route-
marked map which must instruct the other speaker to draw the same route. The corpus was chosen due to
its abundance of Action-discussion interactions (more than 30% of the overall corpus), which are often
lacking in other corpora.

VerbMobil: This is a collection of task-based dialogues released in 1997 (Burger et al., 2000). A
subset of these dialogues is annotated with DAs (Alexandersson et al., 1998). The scenario involves two
speakers, which play respectively the roles of a travel agent and of a client. The client usually provides a
set of constraints and requests to be satisﬁed, while the traveling agent has to ask questions and provide
information in order to satisfy the client’s requests. Interactions happening within the VerbMobil 2 corpus
closely resemble those usually seen with personal assistants, with a user looking for the fulﬁllment of a
task and a serving agent interacting with the user to solve his/her issues making it an appealing addition
to our training set.

BT Oasis: The BT Oasis corpus is a collection of task-based conversations involving personal as-
sistance for clients of the British Telecom services (Leech and Weisser, 2003). The conversations are
human-to-human, and usually involve a user who has a problem to solve and an assistant who helps the
user solving his issues. The BT Oasis corpus was chosen as part of the training set for its interesting
scheme, called SPAAC (Speech Act Annotation scheme for Corpora), which is easily mappable to the
ISO standard due to its clear separation of grammatical and illocutionary act.

3.2 Test sets

DialogBank (DB): the DialogBank (Bunt et al., 2016) is a corpus2 annotated with ISO 24617-2 which
currently contains 15 English dialogues: 3 from MapTask and 3 from TRAINS (Traum, 1996) (both
task-based), 5 from DBOX (games collected in a Wizard-of-Oz fashion) and 4 from Switchboard (open-
domain human-human conversation). Overall there are 1,596 DAs. The corpus currently represents the
only publicly available resource manually annotated using the ISO standard.

Common Alexa Prize Conversations (CAPC): The CAPC corpus (Ram et al., 2017) is a dataset of
3,764 anonymised individual user turns pooled from different users interacting with all socialbots partic-
ipating in the Alexa Prize. We have extracted a balanced subset of 458 turns and have annotated it with
DAs from our adapted version of the ISO standard by 3 annotators, with an inter-annotator agreement of
κ = 0.82. CAPC exempliﬁes frequent user interaction data not biased by the interaction with one social-
bot in particular. Another advantage of this dataset is that it is balanced across different DA categories.
One drawback is that no interaction context (previous DA) is available for the individual turns.

Socialbot Logs (S-Logs): S-Logs is a dataset of 13 open-domain conversations that different native
American English speakers had with one of the socialbots of the Alexa Prize Challenge 2017. Overall
this dataset contains 310 machine DAs and 165 user DAs. Two annotators tagged this dataset with DAs
from our adapted version of ISO 24617-2, with an inter-annotator agreement of κ = 0.81. While we have
annotated both machine and user turns, we test only on the latter and exploit machine turns as features
for our classiﬁcation experiments.

4 Methodology

4.1 Preprocessing

Before mapping the DA schemes of the corpora to the ISO subset scheme, a series of preprocessing
steps have been performed to obtain a uniform training resource with the same surface text features
as the testing corpora, since in S-Logs data, user input is lowercased and the punctuation is limited to
apostrophes. More speciﬁcally, the text has been lowercased (including any named entity appearing in
the original transcription and excluding the ‘I’ pronoun), punctuation has been removed (except for the
apostrophe character in contracted expressions like “let’s” and “can’t”) and any special characters have
been deleted from the utterances. Moreover, any information regarding prosody has been removed, since
this feature is not available in our test sets.

For experiments on the SWDA DAMSL corpus we recreated the same setting described in
(Stolcke et al., 2000), using the same train and test set and preprocessing the corpus in the same way
following the WS97 manual annotator guidelines (Jurafsky, 1997).

4.2 Dialogue Act scheme and mapping

The Socialbot scheme (S-scheme), the DA scheme used during the classiﬁcation experiments, is a
subset of the ofﬁcial ISO standard. Only three dimensions out of the ofﬁcial eight deﬁned in the standard
are considered (Task, Social Obligation Management and Feedback), and some of the communicative
functions are generalized with an higher level of the tree.

Figure 4.2 shows the labeled subset of the ISO standard taxonomy for the General-purpose functions
(i.e. functions independent from any given dimensions), while table 1 shows the correspondence for
dimension-speciﬁc functions. The main difference between the DA scheme labeled in this work and
the complete ISO taxonomy is the lack of further speciﬁcation for the Inform, Commissive and Direc-
tive tags. This is due to the fact that most of the DA schemes used when building the training set do
not provide contextual information detailed enough to label these tags accurately. Moreover, there is
confusion and discrepancies about when these contextual DA should be used, even in the ofﬁcial ISO
guidelines. Indeed, in (Fang et al., 2012), which provides the ofﬁcial mapping from Switchboard to the
ISO standard, it is reported that some contextual DA tags (for example other answer) do not have a di-
rect mapping to the standard. This becomes even more problematic considering that among the training
resources there are corpora like AMI, MapTask or VerbMobil, which label answers as Informs, which
would make training data for this class extremely noisy. A similar argument can be raised on the lower
leaves of the Directive and Commissive nodes, some of which are not labeled even in the very detailed
SWDA taxonomy. Mapping of the available corpora to this scheme was done according to the available
documentation in literature.

For the Switchboard corpus, a detailed mapping is provided in (Fang et al., 2012), which was fol-
lowed exactly for the supported dimensions/communicative functions. For MapTask and AMI, there is
already research highlighting similarities and differences between their schemes and the ISO standard
one (Petukhova et al., 2014b). These results do not provide an exact mapping between the two schemes,
which in some cases is impossible: for example the AMI Elicit-inform tag is the equivalent of ISO 24617-

It is frequently the case that DA tags do not map to any leaf-node, e.g. VerbMobil for Task dimension

2’s Question, but will not map to any speciﬁc question type (SetQ, PropQ, ChoiceQ, etc.). Utterances
whose tags cannot be directly mapped to the ISO scheme were dropped and do not appear in the training
set.

Since there is no available literature on mapping the VerbMobil 2 and BT Oasis corpora to the ISO
standard, a speciﬁc mapping was designed from scratch by drawing inspiration from the approaches
available on other corpora.

Table 2 presents counts of the DAs after mapping to our scheme, across all training and testing corpora.

As mentioned in the paper, the corpora present quite imbalanced distributions of DA categories.

5 Experiments and Results

Since, to the best of our knowledge, there is no established state of the art on DialogBank – the only cor-
pus manually annotated following the ISO 24617-2 scheme – we ﬁrst establish the tagging methodology
on the SWDA corpus using the DAMSL 42 tag set and compare it to the state of the art (Ji et al., 2016).
Then, the feature set and the parameters of the best performing models are used for the training of the
DA tagger on the aggregate dataset, considering some of the semantic dimensions and the communica-
tive functions of the ISO 24617-2 . The models are then evaluated on the DialogBank and open-domain
human-machine data from Amazon Alexa Prize Challenge. McNemar’s test (McNemar, 1947) for sta-
tistical signiﬁcance has been used to analyze whether introduced features give a signiﬁcant contribution
to the overall performance.

5.1 Experiments on SWDA

Prior to training the classiﬁcation models, the SWDA (Jurafsky, 1997) utterances are preprocessed fol-
lowing (Stolcke et al., 2000). The dataset is split into training (1,115 dialogues) and test set (19 dia-
logues) following the same paper, and the remaining 21 dialogues are used as development set to tune
the C parameter of Support Vector Machines (SVM) (Vapnik, 1995). For the experiments, we used

The results of the experiments on SWDA are presented in Table 3. The performances are on the
SWDA test set with the SVM C parameter set to 0.1, with respect to the best results on the devel-
opment set. It is worth mentioning that tuning the C parameter boosts the performance on the devel-
opment set by 2 points.3 For comparison, the table also includes majority baseline, the results from
(Stolcke et al., 2000), the SVM results from (Quarteroni and Riccardi, 2010), and the state-of-the-art re-
sults from (Ji et al., 2016) that were achieved using deep learning methods.

Following the previous studies on SWDA (Stolcke et al., 2000; Quarteroni and Riccardi, 2010), we
experiment with n-grams (unigrams, bigrams, and trigrams) and previous DA tag features. We do not
consider the unit length feature from (Quarteroni and Riccardi, 2010), since classiﬁcation instances in the
SWDA scheme and ISO 24617-2 are different (slash unit vs. functional unit). The results are reported in
Table 3; since the results reported were obtained with SVM C parameter set to 0.1, they are higher than
the ones reported in (Quarteroni and Riccardi, 2010): e.g. for 1-2-grams 70.0 vs. 71.7.

The ﬁrst observation is that the addition of the previous DA signiﬁcantly improves the performance.
Addition of part-of-speech tags does not yield any improvement; however, when POS-tags are indexed
with their positions in an utterance, accuracy is signiﬁcantly improved and rises to 76.2. Addition of
dependency relations (both with and without indexing with their position) does not improve the perfor-
mance. Addition of the averaged pre-trained word-embedding vectors (from Google News) to the model
with indexed POS-tags, however, rises the accuracy to 76.7. The model with word embeddings comes
0.3 short of the state-of-the-art results reported in (Ji et al., 2016).

5.2 Experiments on Aggregate ISO-standard Data

The methodology established on SWDA is applied to training the ISO 24617-2 subset models using
the aggregate data set. Since in ISO 24617-2 annotation scheme DAs consist of semantic dimensions
and communicative functions, the utterances are ﬁrst classiﬁed into the considered semantic dimensions
– general, social obligations management (SOM), and feedback. Then, we experiment with the Task
dimension, reporting the results without error propagation from the previous step, in order to give the
reader a clearer understanding of the current classiﬁcation capabilities when restricting interactions with
the system to general communicative functions.

5.2.1 Semantic Dimension Classiﬁcation

The results of the binary dimension classiﬁcation models on the test sets – DialogBank (DB), CAPC,
and S-Logs – are reported in Table 4. The CAPC corpus consists of isolated utterances; consequently,
the Feedback dimension is not present. On DB and S-Logs, on the other hand, the Feedback dimension
yields the lowest accuracy in comparison to General and SOM dimension communicative functions. Low
performances on the Feedback dimension could be explained by the fact that the training data mostly
contains Allo-feedback and lacks Auto-feedback and Feedback elicitations, which are present in DB.

5.2.2 Communicative Function Classiﬁcation

The utterances are further classiﬁed into communicative functions of the General (Task) dimension, using
the methodology established on SWDA, i.e. the same hyper-parameter settings (C = 0.1) and features.
However, since models with dependency relations do not yield statistically signiﬁcant differences, they
are also considered. The results of the models on the test sets are reported in Table 5. The behavior of the
models trained with various feature combinations is in-line with the SWDA experiments: the addition
of the previous DA tags and part-of-speech tags indexed with their positions in a sentence improves the
performance. Different from the SWDA, the addition of the indexed dependency relations improves the
performance on the test sets. In the case of DialogBank and CAPC, their contribution is statistically
signiﬁcant. Additionally, unlike for SWDA, the addition of word embeddings with and without index
dependency relation (I-DEP) does not produce signiﬁcant improvements for all but CAPC. Consequently,
the model trained on 1-2-grams, previous DA tags, indexed POS-tags and dependency relations is chosen
for the ablation study.

5.2.3 Corpora Combinations

The aggregation of all the corpora mapped to our subset of ISO 24617-2 is not necessarily the best one, as
the distributions of DA categories varies from corpus to corpus. Consequently, we also present results on
the test sets for the models trained solely on SWDA and AMI; as well as perform an ablation experiment
removing one corpus at a time. The best performing model from the previous subsection (1-2-grams,
previous DA-tag, indexed POS-tags, and indexed dependency relations) is used for the study. The results
of these experiments are reported in Table 6.

While the best results for Dialog Bank are achieved considering all the corpora, for CAPC the best
results are achieved by removing MapTask. For S-Logs, on the other hand, the best performing corpora
combination is all except VerbMobil. However, the performance differences from the models trained
on all corpora are not statistically signiﬁcant. Training DA taggers solely on SWDA and AMI – the
largest and the most diverse corpora – yields performances inferior to the combination of all the corpora.
From the table, we can also observe that these two corpora – SWDA and AMI – contribute most to
the performance, as removing them affects the performance the most. On the other hand, removing the
smaller datasets – BT Oasis, MapTask, and VerbMobil – affects the performance less.

6 Conclusions

We have presented an effective methodology for corpora aggregation for domain-independent Dialogue
Act Tagging on a subset of the ISO 24617-2 annotation. We have also reported an accurate evaluation

of our approach on both in-domain and out-of-domain datasets, proving that the described DA tagging
technique is indeed independent from the underlying scheme and task of the annotated corpora. Fi-
nally, the machine learning technique used for DA tagging was tested on a popular DA tagging task (the
Switchboard corpus), obtaining very close to state-of-the-art results.

This work represents one of the ﬁrst attempts to use an ISO compliant DA scheme for a real-life ap-
plication, as well as one of the ﬁrst structured approaches for evaluation of dialogue resources annotated
with this taxonomy.

Research on available training resources is one of the ﬁrst things to look forward to, since the current
data proved to be effective, but also presented numerous drawbacks (lack of adequate coverage for the
Feedback dimension, imbalanced DAs, lack of context-aware communicative functions). We plan to
make our resource continue to grow in the future by adding and mapping additional corpora, such as the
MRDA (Shriberg et al., 2004) corpus.

This project was partially funded by Amazon Alexa Prize 2017 research grant.

Abstract

Dialogue Act (DA) tagging is crucial for spoken language understanding systems, as it provides
a general representation of speakers’ intents, not bound to a particular dialogue system. Unfor-
tunately, publicly available data sets with DA annotation are all based on different annotation
schemes and thus incompatible with each other. Moreover, their schemes often do not cover
all aspects necessary for open-domain human-machine interaction. In this paper, we propose a
methodology to map several publicly available corpora to a subset of the ISO standard, in order
to create a large task-independent training corpus for DA classiﬁcation. We show the feasibility
of using this corpus to train a domain-independent DA tagger testing it on out-of-domain con-
versational data, and argue the importance of training on multiple corpora to achieve robustness
across different DA categories.

1 Introduction

The correct interpretation of the intents behind a speaker’s utterances plays an essential role in determin-
ing the success of a dialogue. Hence, the module responsible for intents classiﬁcation lies at the very
core of many dialogue systems, both in research and industry (e.g. Alexa, Siri). Moreover, although
the task of intent recognition is traditionally linked to task-based systems, recently it has also proved
crucial for non task-based conversational systems. According to the results of the Amazon Alexa Prize
challenge (Ram et al., 2017), the most successful conversational systems in the competition relied on a
strong spoken language understanding module, while more than 60% of the approaches explicitly used
intents.

Nevertheless, automatic intent recognition is hard, since participants’ intents in a dialogue are im-
plicit. Intent classiﬁcation has therefore been mostly modeled as a supervised machine learning prob-
lem (Gupta et al., 2006; Xu and Sarikaya, 2013; Yang et al., 2017), with the consequent deﬁnition of
intents taxonomies. Over time this led to the creation of expensive annotated resources (Price, 1990;
Henderson et al., 2014) with the related time-consuming design of multiple intent schemes.
In most
cases, however, intents taxonomies are deﬁned speciﬁcally for a given application or a dataset and are
not generalizable to other systems or tasks, making these resources difﬁcult to reuse (e.g. the popular Air
Travel Information Services (ATIS) corpus include heavily domain-dependent intents such as Airfare or
Ground Service).

Dialogue Acts (DA), also known as speech or communicative acts, represent an attempt to create a
formalized and generalized version of intents. As such, DAs have been investigated by the research
community for many years (Stolcke et al., 2000) and have been applied successfully to many tasks.
In particular, their aspiration to generality makes them an appealing option for non task-based ap-
plication (e.g. more than 20% of the teams in Amazon Alexa Prize Challenge explicitly used DAs
(Cervone et al., 2017; Bowden et al., 2017), including the winning team (Fang et al., 2017)). Also, in
the case of DAs, over the years there have been several efforts to produce publicly available annotated

resources (Godfrey et al., 1992; Carletta, 2006; Alexandersson et al., 1998) to train DA taggers. The DA
taxonomies created for these resources, albeit arguably more general compared to corpora like ATIS (for
example utilizing categories such as wh-questions), are still dataset speciﬁc; since many of these schemes
lack coverage of some crucial aspects of dialogic interaction. Furthermore, given that all these datasets
utilize different schemes, these resources are hardly compatible.

The ISO 24617-2 (Bunt et al., 2010; Bunt et al., 2012), the international ISO standard for DA an-
notation, represents the ﬁrst attempt to create a truly domain and task independent scheme. Given
its holistic approach compared to previous schemes, ISO 24617-2 can be used as a lingua franca for
cross-corpora DA mapping, as conﬁrmed by successful attempts to remap single corpora to the standard
(Chowdhury et al., 2016; Fang et al., 2012).

However, there is no reference training set for the standard, since the only public resource currently
available with ISO 24617-2 annotation (DialogBank, (Bunt et al., 2016)) is too small to be used to train
classiﬁers. Therefore, most DA tagging research still focuses on in-domain studies on large datasets with
incompatible DA annotations (Stolcke et al., 2000; Ji et al., 2016). Moreover, most publicly available
corpora are imbalanced with respect to the distribution of various DA dimensions such as Information
Transfer (e.g. “What’s your favourite book?”) or Action Discussion (e.g. “Tell me the news.”), which
are required for successful open-domain conversational systems.

In this work, we show how to reuse and combine publicly available annotated resources to create a
large training corpus for domain-independent DA tagging experiments. We map different corpora using
an ISO standard compliant DA taxonomy, following the previous research on the topic (Fang et al., 2012;
Petukhova et al., 2014b) and we share this resource with the research community.1

In order to investigate the soundness of our approach compared to in-domain models we further exper-
iment with domain-independent DA tagging. As previously done in the literature we cast the Dialogue
Act tagging task as a supervised multi-class classiﬁcation problem using Support Vector Machines. The
correctness of the approach is ﬁrst tested on the de facto DA tagging standard – the Switchboard (SWDA)
corpus (Godfrey et al., 1992), using the reference training and test sets and achieving performance com-
parable to the state-of-the-art approaches. Secondly, we experiment with domain-independent DA tag-
ging following the same approach and using our combined resource as a training corpus. The DialogBank
corpus, that represents a reference manual DA annotation for the ISO standard, is used for the evaluation
of the tagger. To the best of our knowledge this is the ﬁrst attempt to test automatic DA annotation on
this corpus.

The domain-independence and suitability of the tagger for conversational systems trained on multiple
resources is additionally evaluated on two other corpora annotated following our optimized taxonomy
(human-machine conversations from the Amazon Alexa Prize Challenge). The performances achieved on
these three datasets suggest that the training on multiple corpora represents a step forward for DA tagging
of open-domain non task-based human-machine conversations. Finally, we present experiments to in-
vestigate the contribution of the different corpora to the performance of the classiﬁers. The results of our
experiments show the importance of utilizing multiple resources to achieve a sound performance across
different types of DA categories. The multi-domain DA tagger presented here was successfully employed
in Roving Mind, our open-domain conversational system for the Alexa Prize (Cervone et al., 2017).

2 State of the Art

2.1 Dialogue Act Annotation Schemes

The notion of Dialogue Acts can be traced back to the one of illocutionary acts introduced by
(Austin and Urmson, 1962). The illocutionary act represents a level of description of an utterance’s
meaning that goes beyond the purely semantic level (“Is the window open?”) to encompass the intent of
the speaker in producing that utterance (“Please, close the window.”).

One of

the task-based corpus MapTask
(Anderson et al., 1991) in the early nineties. The MapTask scheme distinguishes between initiating

the ﬁrst DA taxonomies was the one created for

moves – such as giving instructions, explaining, checking information or asking questions – and response
moves – for example acknowledging instructions, answering questions and clarifying information. The
corpus also makes a distinction regarding the grammatical and semantic structure of the interactions,
classifying, for example wh-questions, yn-questions and positive/negative answers. Although pioneering
at the time, the MapTask annotation scheme is very speciﬁc to the described scenario, and some of its
instruct, clarify, check) do not scale well to generic, non task-based conversations. More-
DAs (e.g.
over, its taxonomy was not designed to capture all human behaviours during conversations, and, as a
consequence, its coverage for labelling a non task-based interaction is inadequate.

The ﬁrst attempt to deﬁne a uniﬁed, non task-based standard for DA tagging was the Discourse
Annotation and Markup System of Labeling (DAMSL) (Core and Allen, 1997) tag-set for the SWDA
(Godfrey et al., 1992) corpus. This annotation scheme proposes a taxonomy of 42 tags, describing
both semantic aspects of conversation (opinion, non-opinion, preference, etc.), syntactic aspects (yn-
questions, wh-questions, declarative questions, etc.) and behaviours related to the dialogue (conven-
tional closing, hedge, backchanneling, etc.). Nevertheless, the taxonomy still has some issues: tags are
mutually exclusive (making it impossible to annotate, for example, a no answer which was also signaling
non-understanding) and are organised in a ﬂat taxonomy, which does not take into account similarities
and differences between the tags.

Bunt (1999) introduced the Dynamic Interpretation Theory (DIT) for dialogues, setting the theoretical
foundation for a domain-independent and task-independent DA taxonomy. The paper introduced some
very important concepts like the idea of multidimensionality of DAs and the distinction between Action-
Discussion, a macro-category of DAs encompassing cases in which interlocutors negotiate actions to be
performed (e.g. requests like “Let’s switch topic.”), and Information-Transfer interactions, capturing the
DAs through which speakers exchange information (e.g. sharing personal information like “My name is
John.”). The DIT++ taxonomy (Bunt, 2009) was then deﬁned in 2009 with the aim of providing a unique
and universally recognized standard for DA annotation based on the theoretical ideas introduced in the
DIT scheme. Its ﬁfth version was accepted as ISO 24617-2.

The core aspects of the ISO standard are its multidimensionality and its domain and task independence.
The ISO scheme is multidimensional in the sense that it makes a clear distinction between semantic
dimensions (i.e. the aspect of the communication which the DA describes) and communicative functions
(i.e. the illocutionary act performed within that dimension). In this way, ambiguities between various
aspects of the communication and overlapping between DAs are removed. Furthermore, the scheme
contains a generic dimension and communicative functions, which is suitable for mapping virtually any
kind of conversation, both task-based and non task-based. Moreover, its multidimensional aspect and
hierarchical taxonomy make it extensible and potentially adaptable to speciﬁc conversational sets.

2.2 Dialogue Act Tagging

The automatic recognition of Dialogue Acts has been addressed by the literature using various ma-
chine learning techniques.
In particular DA classiﬁcation has been modeled both as a sequence la-
beling problem, using techniques such as HMM (Stolcke et al., 2000), neural networks (Ji et al., 2016;
Kumar et al., 2017) or CRF (Quarteroni et al., 2011), and as a multi-class classiﬁcation problem, using
for example SVM (Quarteroni and Riccardi, 2010). Mentioning and comparing all DA classiﬁcation ap-
proaches is difﬁcult because of the differences in annotation schemes and datasets used. All approaches,
however, are usually tested on in-domain data.

One of the most popular datasets for benchmarking is SWDA (Godfrey et al., 1992), a dataset of
human-human open-domain telephone conversations. The state-of-the-art on SWDA (77.0% accuracy
on 42 DA tags) was achieved by (Ji et al., 2016) using deep neural networks.

The ISO standard (Bunt et al., 2010) can be seen as a generalization of all these annotation schemes.

However, there is no available training data for the ISO standard.

3 Data Sets

3.1 Training sets

The scarcity of resources of adequate size annotated with the ISO standard makes it difﬁcult to train a
DA tagger for this taxonomy. To the best of our knowledge, the DBOX corpus (Petukhova et al., 2014a)
– the only resource manually annotated using the ISO standard – is not yet publicly available . The best
possible approach given the current availability of data is to map existing corpora’s DA schemes to the
ISO scheme. Given the limited – and often domain-dependent – annotation scheme of these resources,
it is impossible to map enough data to train a DA tagger for the full ISO taxonomy, since some of the
ISO dialogue acts have no correspondence in any of the considered corpora. Therefore, we opted for a
reduced version of the taxonomy, limiting our research to subsets of the General (Task), Social Obligation
Management and Feedback dimensions. So far, we mapped the following ﬁve different corpora to our
scheme:

SWDA: The Switchboard corpus (Godfrey et al., 1992) is a dataset of transcribed open-domain tele-
phone conversations. The Switchboard Dialogue Act Corpus (SWDA) is a subset of the Switchboard
corpus annotated with DAs. SWDA represents a logical choice when building a training set for a
domain-independent DA tagger, as it is a large collection of open-domain, non task-based conversa-
tions, and therefore provides a natural similarity to the conversational domain of social bots. Moreover,
there are already examples in literature of mappings from the Switchboard corpus to the ISO standard
(Fang et al., 2012). As visible from Figure 3.1, drawbacks of the corpus with respect to the task in-
clude its unbalancedness (60% of utterances are Information-providing) and lack of Action-Discussion
interactions (less than 1% of overall corpus).

AMI: This corpus contains transcriptions from 100 hours of meeting recordings of the European-
funded AMI project (FP6-506811), a consortium dedicated to the research and development of technol-
ogy (Carletta, 2006). This dataset presents a reasonably balanced collection of utterances and a taxon-
omy which shares some similarities with the ISO standard (e.g. distinction between Action-discussion
and Information-transfer). Drawbacks of the corpus include the fact that there are multiple speakers (it
is therefore more difﬁcult to capture contextual information) and sometimes its scheme does not map to
the leaves of the ISO tree.

MapTask: This is a task-based dialogue corpus collected by the HCRC at the University of Edinburgh
(Anderson et al., 1991). Dialogues involve two participants, one with an empty map and one with a route-
marked map which must instruct the other speaker to draw the same route. The corpus was chosen due to
its abundance of Action-discussion interactions (more than 30% of the overall corpus), which are often
lacking in other corpora.

VerbMobil: This is a collection of task-based dialogues released in 1997 (Burger et al., 2000). A
subset of these dialogues is annotated with DAs (Alexandersson et al., 1998). The scenario involves two
speakers, which play respectively the roles of a travel agent and of a client. The client usually provides a
set of constraints and requests to be satisﬁed, while the traveling agent has to ask questions and provide
information in order to satisfy the client’s requests. Interactions happening within the VerbMobil 2 corpus
closely resemble those usually seen with personal assistants, with a user looking for the fulﬁllment of a
task and a serving agent interacting with the user to solve his/her issues making it an appealing addition
to our training set.

BT Oasis: The BT Oasis corpus is a collection of task-based conversations involving personal as-
sistance for clients of the British Telecom services (Leech and Weisser, 2003). The conversations are
human-to-human, and usually involve a user who has a problem to solve and an assistant who helps the
user solving his issues. The BT Oasis corpus was chosen as part of the training set for its interesting
scheme, called SPAAC (Speech Act Annotation scheme for Corpora), which is easily mappable to the
ISO standard due to its clear separation of grammatical and illocutionary act.

3.2 Test sets

DialogBank (DB): the DialogBank (Bunt et al., 2016) is a corpus2 annotated with ISO 24617-2 which
currently contains 15 English dialogues: 3 from MapTask and 3 from TRAINS (Traum, 1996) (both
task-based), 5 from DBOX (games collected in a Wizard-of-Oz fashion) and 4 from Switchboard (open-
domain human-human conversation). Overall there are 1,596 DAs. The corpus currently represents the
only publicly available resource manually annotated using the ISO standard.

Common Alexa Prize Conversations (CAPC): The CAPC corpus (Ram et al., 2017) is a dataset of
3,764 anonymised individual user turns pooled from different users interacting with all socialbots partic-
ipating in the Alexa Prize. We have extracted a balanced subset of 458 turns and have annotated it with
DAs from our adapted version of the ISO standard by 3 annotators, with an inter-annotator agreement of
κ = 0.82. CAPC exempliﬁes frequent user interaction data not biased by the interaction with one social-
bot in particular. Another advantage of this dataset is that it is balanced across different DA categories.
One drawback is that no interaction context (previous DA) is available for the individual turns.

Socialbot Logs (S-Logs): S-Logs is a dataset of 13 open-domain conversations that different native
American English speakers had with one of the socialbots of the Alexa Prize Challenge 2017. Overall
this dataset contains 310 machine DAs and 165 user DAs. Two annotators tagged this dataset with DAs
from our adapted version of ISO 24617-2, with an inter-annotator agreement of κ = 0.81. While we have
annotated both machine and user turns, we test only on the latter and exploit machine turns as features
for our classiﬁcation experiments.

4 Methodology

4.1 Preprocessing

Before mapping the DA schemes of the corpora to the ISO subset scheme, a series of preprocessing
steps have been performed to obtain a uniform training resource with the same surface text features
as the testing corpora, since in S-Logs data, user input is lowercased and the punctuation is limited to
apostrophes. More speciﬁcally, the text has been lowercased (including any named entity appearing in
the original transcription and excluding the ‘I’ pronoun), punctuation has been removed (except for the
apostrophe character in contracted expressions like “let’s” and “can’t”) and any special characters have
been deleted from the utterances. Moreover, any information regarding prosody has been removed, since
this feature is not available in our test sets.

For experiments on the SWDA DAMSL corpus we recreated the same setting described in
(Stolcke et al., 2000), using the same train and test set and preprocessing the corpus in the same way
following the WS97 manual annotator guidelines (Jurafsky, 1997).

4.2 Dialogue Act scheme and mapping

The Socialbot scheme (S-scheme), the DA scheme used during the classiﬁcation experiments, is a
subset of the ofﬁcial ISO standard. Only three dimensions out of the ofﬁcial eight deﬁned in the standard
are considered (Task, Social Obligation Management and Feedback), and some of the communicative
functions are generalized with an higher level of the tree.

Figure 4.2 shows the labeled subset of the ISO standard taxonomy for the General-purpose functions
(i.e. functions independent from any given dimensions), while table 1 shows the correspondence for
dimension-speciﬁc functions. The main difference between the DA scheme labeled in this work and
the complete ISO taxonomy is the lack of further speciﬁcation for the Inform, Commissive and Direc-
tive tags. This is due to the fact that most of the DA schemes used when building the training set do
not provide contextual information detailed enough to label these tags accurately. Moreover, there is
confusion and discrepancies about when these contextual DA should be used, even in the ofﬁcial ISO
guidelines. Indeed, in (Fang et al., 2012), which provides the ofﬁcial mapping from Switchboard to the
ISO standard, it is reported that some contextual DA tags (for example other answer) do not have a di-
rect mapping to the standard. This becomes even more problematic considering that among the training
resources there are corpora like AMI, MapTask or VerbMobil, which label answers as Informs, which
would make training data for this class extremely noisy. A similar argument can be raised on the lower
leaves of the Directive and Commissive nodes, some of which are not labeled even in the very detailed
SWDA taxonomy. Mapping of the available corpora to this scheme was done according to the available
documentation in literature.

For the Switchboard corpus, a detailed mapping is provided in (Fang et al., 2012), which was fol-
lowed exactly for the supported dimensions/communicative functions. For MapTask and AMI, there is
already research highlighting similarities and differences between their schemes and the ISO standard
one (Petukhova et al., 2014b). These results do not provide an exact mapping between the two schemes,
which in some cases is impossible: for example the AMI Elicit-inform tag is the equivalent of ISO 24617-

Table 2: Dialogue Act category counts across the considered corpora for different levels of the taxonomy.
Percentages of corpora indicate the percentage of data available for the particular level in the corpus. ∗
It is frequently the case that DA tags do not map to any leaf-node, e.g. VerbMobil for Task dimension
and AMI for Social Obligations Management.

2’s Question, but will not map to any speciﬁc question type (SetQ, PropQ, ChoiceQ, etc.). Utterances
whose tags cannot be directly mapped to the ISO scheme were dropped and do not appear in the training
set.

Since there is no available literature on mapping the VerbMobil 2 and BT Oasis corpora to the ISO
standard, a speciﬁc mapping was designed from scratch by drawing inspiration from the approaches
available on other corpora.

Table 2 presents counts of the DAs after mapping to our scheme, across all training and testing corpora.

As mentioned in the paper, the corpora present quite imbalanced distributions of DA categories.

5 Experiments and Results

Since, to the best of our knowledge, there is no established state of the art on DialogBank – the only cor-
pus manually annotated following the ISO 24617-2 scheme – we ﬁrst establish the tagging methodology
on the SWDA corpus using the DAMSL 42 tag set and compare it to the state of the art (Ji et al., 2016).
Then, the feature set and the parameters of the best performing models are used for the training of the
DA tagger on the aggregate dataset, considering some of the semantic dimensions and the communica-
tive functions of the ISO 24617-2 . The models are then evaluated on the DialogBank and open-domain
human-machine data from Amazon Alexa Prize Challenge. McNemar’s test (McNemar, 1947) for sta-
tistical signiﬁcance has been used to analyze whether introduced features give a signiﬁcant contribution
to the overall performance.

5.1 Experiments on SWDA

Prior to training the classiﬁcation models, the SWDA (Jurafsky, 1997) utterances are preprocessed fol-
lowing (Stolcke et al., 2000). The dataset is split into training (1,115 dialogues) and test set (19 dia-
logues) following the same paper, and the remaining 21 dialogues are used as development set to tune
the C parameter of Support Vector Machines (SVM) (Vapnik, 1995). For the experiments, we used

The results of the experiments on SWDA are presented in Table 3. The performances are on the
SWDA test set with the SVM C parameter set to 0.1, with respect to the best results on the devel-
opment set. It is worth mentioning that tuning the C parameter boosts the performance on the devel-
opment set by 2 points.3 For comparison, the table also includes majority baseline, the results from
(Stolcke et al., 2000), the SVM results from (Quarteroni and Riccardi, 2010), and the state-of-the-art re-
sults from (Ji et al., 2016) that were achieved using deep learning methods.

Following the previous studies on SWDA (Stolcke et al., 2000; Quarteroni and Riccardi, 2010), we
experiment with n-grams (unigrams, bigrams, and trigrams) and previous DA tag features. We do not
consider the unit length feature from (Quarteroni and Riccardi, 2010), since classiﬁcation instances in the
SWDA scheme and ISO 24617-2 are different (slash unit vs. functional unit). The results are reported in
Table 3; since the results reported were obtained with SVM C parameter set to 0.1, they are higher than
the ones reported in (Quarteroni and Riccardi, 2010): e.g. for 1-2-grams 70.0 vs. 71.7.

The ﬁrst observation is that the addition of the previous DA signiﬁcantly improves the performance.
Addition of part-of-speech tags does not yield any improvement; however, when POS-tags are indexed
with their positions in an utterance, accuracy is signiﬁcantly improved and rises to 76.2. Addition of
dependency relations (both with and without indexing with their position) does not improve the perfor-
mance. Addition of the averaged pre-trained word-embedding vectors (from Google News) to the model
with indexed POS-tags, however, rises the accuracy to 76.7. The model with word embeddings comes
0.3 short of the state-of-the-art results reported in (Ji et al., 2016).

5.2 Experiments on Aggregate ISO-standard Data

The methodology established on SWDA is applied to training the ISO 24617-2 subset models using
the aggregate data set. Since in ISO 24617-2 annotation scheme DAs consist of semantic dimensions
and communicative functions, the utterances are ﬁrst classiﬁed into the considered semantic dimensions
– general, social obligations management (SOM), and feedback. Then, we experiment with the Task
dimension, reporting the results without error propagation from the previous step, in order to give the
reader a clearer understanding of the current classiﬁcation capabilities when restricting interactions with
the system to general communicative functions.

5.2.1 Semantic Dimension Classiﬁcation

The results of the binary dimension classiﬁcation models on the test sets – DialogBank (DB), CAPC,
and S-Logs – are reported in Table 4. The CAPC corpus consists of isolated utterances; consequently,
the Feedback dimension is not present. On DB and S-Logs, on the other hand, the Feedback dimension
yields the lowest accuracy in comparison to General and SOM dimension communicative functions. Low
performances on the Feedback dimension could be explained by the fact that the training data mostly
contains Allo-feedback and lacks Auto-feedback and Feedback elicitations, which are present in DB.

5.2.2 Communicative Function Classiﬁcation

The utterances are further classiﬁed into communicative functions of the General (Task) dimension, using
the methodology established on SWDA, i.e. the same hyper-parameter settings (C = 0.1) and features.
However, since models with dependency relations do not yield statistically signiﬁcant differences, they
are also considered. The results of the models on the test sets are reported in Table 5. The behavior of the
models trained with various feature combinations is in-line with the SWDA experiments: the addition
of the previous DA tags and part-of-speech tags indexed with their positions in a sentence improves the
performance. Different from the SWDA, the addition of the indexed dependency relations improves the
performance on the test sets. In the case of DialogBank and CAPC, their contribution is statistically
signiﬁcant. Additionally, unlike for SWDA, the addition of word embeddings with and without index
dependency relation (I-DEP) does not produce signiﬁcant improvements for all but CAPC. Consequently,
the model trained on 1-2-grams, previous DA tags, indexed POS-tags and dependency relations is chosen
for the ablation study.

5.2.3 Corpora Combinations

The aggregation of all the corpora mapped to our subset of ISO 24617-2 is not necessarily the best one, as
the distributions of DA categories varies from corpus to corpus. Consequently, we also present results on
the test sets for the models trained solely on SWDA and AMI; as well as perform an ablation experiment
removing one corpus at a time. The best performing model from the previous subsection (1-2-grams,
previous DA-tag, indexed POS-tags, and indexed dependency relations) is used for the study. The results
of these experiments are reported in Table 6.

While the best results for Dialog Bank are achieved considering all the corpora, for CAPC the best
results are achieved by removing MapTask. For S-Logs, on the other hand, the best performing corpora
combination is all except VerbMobil. However, the performance differences from the models trained
on all corpora are not statistically signiﬁcant. Training DA taggers solely on SWDA and AMI – the
largest and the most diverse corpora – yields performances inferior to the combination of all the corpora.
From the table, we can also observe that these two corpora – SWDA and AMI – contribute most to
the performance, as removing them affects the performance the most. On the other hand, removing the
smaller datasets – BT Oasis, MapTask, and VerbMobil – affects the performance less.

6 Conclusions

We have presented an effective methodology for corpora aggregation for domain-independent Dialogue
Act Tagging on a subset of the ISO 24617-2 annotation. We have also reported an accurate evaluation

of our approach on both in-domain and out-of-domain datasets, proving that the described DA tagging
technique is indeed independent from the underlying scheme and task of the annotated corpora. Fi-
nally, the machine learning technique used for DA tagging was tested on a popular DA tagging task (the
Switchboard corpus), obtaining very close to state-of-the-art results.

This work represents one of the ﬁrst attempts to use an ISO compliant DA scheme for a real-life ap-
plication, as well as one of the ﬁrst structured approaches for evaluation of dialogue resources annotated
with this taxonomy.

Research on available training resources is one of the ﬁrst things to look forward to, since the current
data proved to be effective, but also presented numerous drawbacks (lack of adequate coverage for the
Feedback dimension, imbalanced DAs, lack of context-aware communicative functions). We plan to
make our resource continue to grow in the future by adding and mapping additional corpora, such as the
MRDA (Shriberg et al., 2004) corpus.

Abstract

Dialogue Act (DA) tagging is crucial for spoken language understanding systems, as it provides
a general representation of speakers’ intents, not bound to a particular dialogue system. Unfor-
tunately, publicly available data sets with DA annotation are all based on different annotation
schemes and thus incompatible with each other. Moreover, their schemes often do not cover
all aspects necessary for open-domain human-machine interaction. In this paper, we propose a
methodology to map several publicly available corpora to a subset of the ISO standard, in order
to create a large task-independent training corpus for DA classiﬁcation. We show the feasibility
of using this corpus to train a domain-independent DA tagger testing it on out-of-domain con-
versational data, and argue the importance of training on multiple corpora to achieve robustness
across different DA categories.

1 Introduction

The correct interpretation of the intents behind a speaker’s utterances plays an essential role in determin-
ing the success of a dialogue. Hence, the module responsible for intents classiﬁcation lies at the very
core of many dialogue systems, both in research and industry (e.g. Alexa, Siri). Moreover, although
the task of intent recognition is traditionally linked to task-based systems, recently it has also proved
crucial for non task-based conversational systems. According to the results of the Amazon Alexa Prize
challenge (Ram et al., 2017), the most successful conversational systems in the competition relied on a
strong spoken language understanding module, while more than 60% of the approaches explicitly used
intents.

Nevertheless, automatic intent recognition is hard, since participants’ intents in a dialogue are im-
plicit. Intent classiﬁcation has therefore been mostly modeled as a supervised machine learning prob-
lem (Gupta et al., 2006; Xu and Sarikaya, 2013; Yang et al., 2017), with the consequent deﬁnition of
intents taxonomies. Over time this led to the creation of expensive annotated resources (Price, 1990;
Henderson et al., 2014) with the related time-consuming design of multiple intent schemes.
In most
cases, however, intents taxonomies are deﬁned speciﬁcally for a given application or a dataset and are
not generalizable to other systems or tasks, making these resources difﬁcult to reuse (e.g. the popular Air
Travel Information Services (ATIS) corpus include heavily domain-dependent intents such as Airfare or
Ground Service).

Dialogue Acts (DA), also known as speech or communicative acts, represent an attempt to create a
formalized and generalized version of intents. As such, DAs have been investigated by the research
community for many years (Stolcke et al., 2000) and have been applied successfully to many tasks.
In particular, their aspiration to generality makes them an appealing option for non task-based ap-
plication (e.g. more than 20% of the teams in Amazon Alexa Prize Challenge explicitly used DAs
(Cervone et al., 2017; Bowden et al., 2017), including the winning team (Fang et al., 2017)). Also, in
the case of DAs, over the years there have been several efforts to produce publicly available annotated

resources (Godfrey et al., 1992; Carletta, 2006; Alexandersson et al., 1998) to train DA taggers. The DA
taxonomies created for these resources, albeit arguably more general compared to corpora like ATIS (for
example utilizing categories such as wh-questions), are still dataset speciﬁc; since many of these schemes
lack coverage of some crucial aspects of dialogic interaction. Furthermore, given that all these datasets
utilize different schemes, these resources are hardly compatible.

The ISO 24617-2 (Bunt et al., 2010; Bunt et al., 2012), the international ISO standard for DA an-
notation, represents the ﬁrst attempt to create a truly domain and task independent scheme. Given
its holistic approach compared to previous schemes, ISO 24617-2 can be used as a lingua franca for
cross-corpora DA mapping, as conﬁrmed by successful attempts to remap single corpora to the standard
(Chowdhury et al., 2016; Fang et al., 2012).

However, there is no reference training set for the standard, since the only public resource currently
available with ISO 24617-2 annotation (DialogBank, (Bunt et al., 2016)) is too small to be used to train
classiﬁers. Therefore, most DA tagging research still focuses on in-domain studies on large datasets with
incompatible DA annotations (Stolcke et al., 2000; Ji et al., 2016). Moreover, most publicly available
corpora are imbalanced with respect to the distribution of various DA dimensions such as Information
Transfer (e.g. “What’s your favourite book?”) or Action Discussion (e.g. “Tell me the news.”), which
are required for successful open-domain conversational systems.

In this work, we show how to reuse and combine publicly available annotated resources to create a
large training corpus for domain-independent DA tagging experiments. We map different corpora using
an ISO standard compliant DA taxonomy, following the previous research on the topic (Fang et al., 2012;
Petukhova et al., 2014b) and we share this resource with the research community.1

In order to investigate the soundness of our approach compared to in-domain models we further exper-
iment with domain-independent DA tagging. As previously done in the literature we cast the Dialogue
Act tagging task as a supervised multi-class classiﬁcation problem using Support Vector Machines. The
correctness of the approach is ﬁrst tested on the de facto DA tagging standard – the Switchboard (SWDA)
corpus (Godfrey et al., 1992), using the reference training and test sets and achieving performance com-
parable to the state-of-the-art approaches. Secondly, we experiment with domain-independent DA tag-
ging following the same approach and using our combined resource as a training corpus. The DialogBank
corpus, that represents a reference manual DA annotation for the ISO standard, is used for the evaluation
of the tagger. To the best of our knowledge this is the ﬁrst attempt to test automatic DA annotation on
this corpus.

The domain-independence and suitability of the tagger for conversational systems trained on multiple
resources is additionally evaluated on two other corpora annotated following our optimized taxonomy
(human-machine conversations from the Amazon Alexa Prize Challenge). The performances achieved on
these three datasets suggest that the training on multiple corpora represents a step forward for DA tagging
of open-domain non task-based human-machine conversations. Finally, we present experiments to in-
vestigate the contribution of the different corpora to the performance of the classiﬁers. The results of our
experiments show the importance of utilizing multiple resources to achieve a sound performance across
different types of DA categories. The multi-domain DA tagger presented here was successfully employed
in Roving Mind, our open-domain conversational system for the Alexa Prize (Cervone et al., 2017).

2 State of the Art

2.1 Dialogue Act Annotation Schemes

The notion of Dialogue Acts can be traced back to the one of illocutionary acts introduced by
(Austin and Urmson, 1962). The illocutionary act represents a level of description of an utterance’s
meaning that goes beyond the purely semantic level (“Is the window open?”) to encompass the intent of
the speaker in producing that utterance (“Please, close the window.”).

One of

the task-based corpus MapTask
(Anderson et al., 1991) in the early nineties. The MapTask scheme distinguishes between initiating

the ﬁrst DA taxonomies was the one created for

moves – such as giving instructions, explaining, checking information or asking questions – and response
moves – for example acknowledging instructions, answering questions and clarifying information. The
corpus also makes a distinction regarding the grammatical and semantic structure of the interactions,
classifying, for example wh-questions, yn-questions and positive/negative answers. Although pioneering
at the time, the MapTask annotation scheme is very speciﬁc to the described scenario, and some of its
instruct, clarify, check) do not scale well to generic, non task-based conversations. More-
DAs (e.g.
over, its taxonomy was not designed to capture all human behaviours during conversations, and, as a
consequence, its coverage for labelling a non task-based interaction is inadequate.

The ﬁrst attempt to deﬁne a uniﬁed, non task-based standard for DA tagging was the Discourse
Annotation and Markup System of Labeling (DAMSL) (Core and Allen, 1997) tag-set for the SWDA
(Godfrey et al., 1992) corpus. This annotation scheme proposes a taxonomy of 42 tags, describing
both semantic aspects of conversation (opinion, non-opinion, preference, etc.), syntactic aspects (yn-
questions, wh-questions, declarative questions, etc.) and behaviours related to the dialogue (conven-
tional closing, hedge, backchanneling, etc.). Nevertheless, the taxonomy still has some issues: tags are
mutually exclusive (making it impossible to annotate, for example, a no answer which was also signaling
non-understanding) and are organised in a ﬂat taxonomy, which does not take into account similarities
and differences between the tags.

Bunt (1999) introduced the Dynamic Interpretation Theory (DIT) for dialogues, setting the theoretical
foundation for a domain-independent and task-independent DA taxonomy. The paper introduced some
very important concepts like the idea of multidimensionality of DAs and the distinction between Action-
Discussion, a macro-category of DAs encompassing cases in which interlocutors negotiate actions to be
performed (e.g. requests like “Let’s switch topic.”), and Information-Transfer interactions, capturing the
DAs through which speakers exchange information (e.g. sharing personal information like “My name is
John.”). The DIT++ taxonomy (Bunt, 2009) was then deﬁned in 2009 with the aim of providing a unique
and universally recognized standard for DA annotation based on the theoretical ideas introduced in the
DIT scheme. Its ﬁfth version was accepted as ISO 24617-2.

The core aspects of the ISO standard are its multidimensionality and its domain and task independence.
The ISO scheme is multidimensional in the sense that it makes a clear distinction between semantic
dimensions (i.e. the aspect of the communication which the DA describes) and communicative functions
(i.e. the illocutionary act performed within that dimension). In this way, ambiguities between various
aspects of the communication and overlapping between DAs are removed. Furthermore, the scheme
contains a generic dimension and communicative functions, which is suitable for mapping virtually any
kind of conversation, both task-based and non task-based. Moreover, its multidimensional aspect and
hierarchical taxonomy make it extensible and potentially adaptable to speciﬁc conversational sets.

2.2 Dialogue Act Tagging

The automatic recognition of Dialogue Acts has been addressed by the literature using various ma-
chine learning techniques.
In particular DA classiﬁcation has been modeled both as a sequence la-
beling problem, using techniques such as HMM (Stolcke et al., 2000), neural networks (Ji et al., 2016;
Kumar et al., 2017) or CRF (Quarteroni et al., 2011), and as a multi-class classiﬁcation problem, using
for example SVM (Quarteroni and Riccardi, 2010). Mentioning and comparing all DA classiﬁcation ap-
proaches is difﬁcult because of the differences in annotation schemes and datasets used. All approaches,
however, are usually tested on in-domain data.

One of the most popular datasets for benchmarking is SWDA (Godfrey et al., 1992), a dataset of
human-human open-domain telephone conversations. The state-of-the-art on SWDA (77.0% accuracy
on 42 DA tags) was achieved by (Ji et al., 2016) using deep neural networks.

The ISO standard (Bunt et al., 2010) can be seen as a generalization of all these annotation schemes.

However, there is no available training data for the ISO standard.

3 Data Sets

3.1 Training sets

The scarcity of resources of adequate size annotated with the ISO standard makes it difﬁcult to train a
DA tagger for this taxonomy. To the best of our knowledge, the DBOX corpus (Petukhova et al., 2014a)
– the only resource manually annotated using the ISO standard – is not yet publicly available . The best
possible approach given the current availability of data is to map existing corpora’s DA schemes to the
ISO scheme. Given the limited – and often domain-dependent – annotation scheme of these resources,
it is impossible to map enough data to train a DA tagger for the full ISO taxonomy, since some of the
ISO dialogue acts have no correspondence in any of the considered corpora. Therefore, we opted for a
reduced version of the taxonomy, limiting our research to subsets of the General (Task), Social Obligation
Management and Feedback dimensions. So far, we mapped the following ﬁve different corpora to our
scheme:

SWDA: The Switchboard corpus (Godfrey et al., 1992) is a dataset of transcribed open-domain tele-
phone conversations. The Switchboard Dialogue Act Corpus (SWDA) is a subset of the Switchboard
corpus annotated with DAs. SWDA represents a logical choice when building a training set for a
domain-independent DA tagger, as it is a large collection of open-domain, non task-based conversa-
tions, and therefore provides a natural similarity to the conversational domain of social bots. Moreover,
there are already examples in literature of mappings from the Switchboard corpus to the ISO standard
(Fang et al., 2012). As visible from Figure 3.1, drawbacks of the corpus with respect to the task in-
clude its unbalancedness (60% of utterances are Information-providing) and lack of Action-Discussion
interactions (less than 1% of overall corpus).

AMI: This corpus contains transcriptions from 100 hours of meeting recordings of the European-
funded AMI project (FP6-506811), a consortium dedicated to the research and development of technol-
ogy (Carletta, 2006). This dataset presents a reasonably balanced collection of utterances and a taxon-
omy which shares some similarities with the ISO standard (e.g. distinction between Action-discussion
and Information-transfer). Drawbacks of the corpus include the fact that there are multiple speakers (it
is therefore more difﬁcult to capture contextual information) and sometimes its scheme does not map to
the leaves of the ISO tree.

MapTask: This is a task-based dialogue corpus collected by the HCRC at the University of Edinburgh
(Anderson et al., 1991). Dialogues involve two participants, one with an empty map and one with a route-
marked map which must instruct the other speaker to draw the same route. The corpus was chosen due to
its abundance of Action-discussion interactions (more than 30% of the overall corpus), which are often
lacking in other corpora.

VerbMobil: This is a collection of task-based dialogues released in 1997 (Burger et al., 2000). A
subset of these dialogues is annotated with DAs (Alexandersson et al., 1998). The scenario involves two
speakers, which play respectively the roles of a travel agent and of a client. The client usually provides a
set of constraints and requests to be satisﬁed, while the traveling agent has to ask questions and provide
information in order to satisfy the client’s requests. Interactions happening within the VerbMobil 2 corpus
closely resemble those usually seen with personal assistants, with a user looking for the fulﬁllment of a
task and a serving agent interacting with the user to solve his/her issues making it an appealing addition
to our training set.

BT Oasis: The BT Oasis corpus is a collection of task-based conversations involving personal as-
sistance for clients of the British Telecom services (Leech and Weisser, 2003). The conversations are
human-to-human, and usually involve a user who has a problem to solve and an assistant who helps the
user solving his issues. The BT Oasis corpus was chosen as part of the training set for its interesting
scheme, called SPAAC (Speech Act Annotation scheme for Corpora), which is easily mappable to the
ISO standard due to its clear separation of grammatical and illocutionary act.

3.2 Test sets

DialogBank (DB): the DialogBank (Bunt et al., 2016) is a corpus2 annotated with ISO 24617-2 which
currently contains 15 English dialogues: 3 from MapTask and 3 from TRAINS (Traum, 1996) (both
task-based), 5 from DBOX (games collected in a Wizard-of-Oz fashion) and 4 from Switchboard (open-
domain human-human conversation). Overall there are 1,596 DAs. The corpus currently represents the
only publicly available resource manually annotated using the ISO standard.

Common Alexa Prize Conversations (CAPC): The CAPC corpus (Ram et al., 2017) is a dataset of
3,764 anonymised individual user turns pooled from different users interacting with all socialbots partic-
ipating in the Alexa Prize. We have extracted a balanced subset of 458 turns and have annotated it with
DAs from our adapted version of the ISO standard by 3 annotators, with an inter-annotator agreement of
κ = 0.82. CAPC exempliﬁes frequent user interaction data not biased by the interaction with one social-
bot in particular. Another advantage of this dataset is that it is balanced across different DA categories.
One drawback is that no interaction context (previous DA) is available for the individual turns.

Socialbot Logs (S-Logs): S-Logs is a dataset of 13 open-domain conversations that different native
American English speakers had with one of the socialbots of the Alexa Prize Challenge 2017. Overall
this dataset contains 310 machine DAs and 165 user DAs. Two annotators tagged this dataset with DAs
from our adapted version of ISO 24617-2, with an inter-annotator agreement of κ = 0.81. While we have
annotated both machine and user turns, we test only on the latter and exploit machine turns as features
for our classiﬁcation experiments.

4 Methodology

4.1 Preprocessing

Before mapping the DA schemes of the corpora to the ISO subset scheme, a series of preprocessing
steps have been performed to obtain a uniform training resource with the same surface text features
as the testing corpora, since in S-Logs data, user input is lowercased and the punctuation is limited to
apostrophes. More speciﬁcally, the text has been lowercased (including any named entity appearing in
the original transcription and excluding the ‘I’ pronoun), punctuation has been removed (except for the
apostrophe character in contracted expressions like “let’s” and “can’t”) and any special characters have
been deleted from the utterances. Moreover, any information regarding prosody has been removed, since
this feature is not available in our test sets.

For experiments on the SWDA DAMSL corpus we recreated the same setting described in
(Stolcke et al., 2000), using the same train and test set and preprocessing the corpus in the same way
following the WS97 manual annotator guidelines (Jurafsky, 1997).

4.2 Dialogue Act scheme and mapping

The Socialbot scheme (S-scheme), the DA scheme used during the classiﬁcation experiments, is a
subset of the ofﬁcial ISO standard. Only three dimensions out of the ofﬁcial eight deﬁned in the standard
are considered (Task, Social Obligation Management and Feedback), and some of the communicative
functions are generalized with an higher level of the tree.

Figure 4.2 shows the labeled subset of the ISO standard taxonomy for the General-purpose functions
(i.e. functions independent from any given dimensions), while table 1 shows the correspondence for
dimension-speciﬁc functions. The main difference between the DA scheme labeled in this work and
the complete ISO taxonomy is the lack of further speciﬁcation for the Inform, Commissive and Direc-
tive tags. This is due to the fact that most of the DA schemes used when building the training set do
not provide contextual information detailed enough to label these tags accurately. Moreover, there is
confusion and discrepancies about when these contextual DA should be used, even in the ofﬁcial ISO
guidelines. Indeed, in (Fang et al., 2012), which provides the ofﬁcial mapping from Switchboard to the
ISO standard, it is reported that some contextual DA tags (for example other answer) do not have a di-
rect mapping to the standard. This becomes even more problematic considering that among the training
resources there are corpora like AMI, MapTask or VerbMobil, which label answers as Informs, which
would make training data for this class extremely noisy. A similar argument can be raised on the lower
leaves of the Directive and Commissive nodes, some of which are not labeled even in the very detailed
SWDA taxonomy. Mapping of the available corpora to this scheme was done according to the available
documentation in literature.

For the Switchboard corpus, a detailed mapping is provided in (Fang et al., 2012), which was fol-
lowed exactly for the supported dimensions/communicative functions. For MapTask and AMI, there is
already research highlighting similarities and differences between their schemes and the ISO standard
one (Petukhova et al., 2014b). These results do not provide an exact mapping between the two schemes,
which in some cases is impossible: for example the AMI Elicit-inform tag is the equivalent of ISO 24617-

Percentages of corpora indicate the percentage of data available for the particular level in the corpus. ∗
It is frequently the case that DA tags do not map to any leaf-node, e.g. VerbMobil for Task dimension

2’s Question, but will not map to any speciﬁc question type (SetQ, PropQ, ChoiceQ, etc.). Utterances
whose tags cannot be directly mapped to the ISO scheme were dropped and do not appear in the training
set.

Since there is no available literature on mapping the VerbMobil 2 and BT Oasis corpora to the ISO
standard, a speciﬁc mapping was designed from scratch by drawing inspiration from the approaches
available on other corpora.

Table 2 presents counts of the DAs after mapping to our scheme, across all training and testing corpora.

As mentioned in the paper, the corpora present quite imbalanced distributions of DA categories.

5 Experiments and Results

Since, to the best of our knowledge, there is no established state of the art on DialogBank – the only cor-
pus manually annotated following the ISO 24617-2 scheme – we ﬁrst establish the tagging methodology
on the SWDA corpus using the DAMSL 42 tag set and compare it to the state of the art (Ji et al., 2016).
Then, the feature set and the parameters of the best performing models are used for the training of the
DA tagger on the aggregate dataset, considering some of the semantic dimensions and the communica-
tive functions of the ISO 24617-2 . The models are then evaluated on the DialogBank and open-domain
human-machine data from Amazon Alexa Prize Challenge. McNemar’s test (McNemar, 1947) for sta-
tistical signiﬁcance has been used to analyze whether introduced features give a signiﬁcant contribution
to the overall performance.

5.1 Experiments on SWDA

Prior to training the classiﬁcation models, the SWDA (Jurafsky, 1997) utterances are preprocessed fol-
lowing (Stolcke et al., 2000). The dataset is split into training (1,115 dialogues) and test set (19 dia-
logues) following the same paper, and the remaining 21 dialogues are used as development set to tune
the C parameter of Support Vector Machines (SVM) (Vapnik, 1995). For the experiments, we used

The results of the experiments on SWDA are presented in Table 3. The performances are on the
SWDA test set with the SVM C parameter set to 0.1, with respect to the best results on the devel-
opment set. It is worth mentioning that tuning the C parameter boosts the performance on the devel-
opment set by 2 points.3 For comparison, the table also includes majority baseline, the results from
(Stolcke et al., 2000), the SVM results from (Quarteroni and Riccardi, 2010), and the state-of-the-art re-
sults from (Ji et al., 2016) that were achieved using deep learning methods.

Following the previous studies on SWDA (Stolcke et al., 2000; Quarteroni and Riccardi, 2010), we
experiment with n-grams (unigrams, bigrams, and trigrams) and previous DA tag features. We do not
consider the unit length feature from (Quarteroni and Riccardi, 2010), since classiﬁcation instances in the
SWDA scheme and ISO 24617-2 are different (slash unit vs. functional unit). The results are reported in
Table 3; since the results reported were obtained with SVM C parameter set to 0.1, they are higher than
the ones reported in (Quarteroni and Riccardi, 2010): e.g. for 1-2-grams 70.0 vs. 71.7.

The ﬁrst observation is that the addition of the previous DA signiﬁcantly improves the performance.
Addition of part-of-speech tags does not yield any improvement; however, when POS-tags are indexed
with their positions in an utterance, accuracy is signiﬁcantly improved and rises to 76.2. Addition of
dependency relations (both with and without indexing with their position) does not improve the perfor-
mance. Addition of the averaged pre-trained word-embedding vectors (from Google News) to the model
with indexed POS-tags, however, rises the accuracy to 76.7. The model with word embeddings comes
0.3 short of the state-of-the-art results reported in (Ji et al., 2016).

5.2 Experiments on Aggregate ISO-standard Data

The methodology established on SWDA is applied to training the ISO 24617-2 subset models using
the aggregate data set. Since in ISO 24617-2 annotation scheme DAs consist of semantic dimensions
and communicative functions, the utterances are ﬁrst classiﬁed into the considered semantic dimensions
– general, social obligations management (SOM), and feedback. Then, we experiment with the Task
dimension, reporting the results without error propagation from the previous step, in order to give the
reader a clearer understanding of the current classiﬁcation capabilities when restricting interactions with
the system to general communicative functions.

5.2.1 Semantic Dimension Classiﬁcation

The results of the binary dimension classiﬁcation models on the test sets – DialogBank (DB), CAPC,
and S-Logs – are reported in Table 4. The CAPC corpus consists of isolated utterances; consequently,
the Feedback dimension is not present. On DB and S-Logs, on the other hand, the Feedback dimension
yields the lowest accuracy in comparison to General and SOM dimension communicative functions. Low
performances on the Feedback dimension could be explained by the fact that the training data mostly
contains Allo-feedback and lacks Auto-feedback and Feedback elicitations, which are present in DB.

5.2.2 Communicative Function Classiﬁcation

The utterances are further classiﬁed into communicative functions of the General (Task) dimension, using
the methodology established on SWDA, i.e. the same hyper-parameter settings (C = 0.1) and features.
However, since models with dependency relations do not yield statistically signiﬁcant differences, they
are also considered. The results of the models on the test sets are reported in Table 5. The behavior of the
models trained with various feature combinations is in-line with the SWDA experiments: the addition
of the previous DA tags and part-of-speech tags indexed with their positions in a sentence improves the
performance. Different from the SWDA, the addition of the indexed dependency relations improves the
performance on the test sets. In the case of DialogBank and CAPC, their contribution is statistically
signiﬁcant. Additionally, unlike for SWDA, the addition of word embeddings with and without index
dependency relation (I-DEP) does not produce signiﬁcant improvements for all but CAPC. Consequently,
the model trained on 1-2-grams, previous DA tags, indexed POS-tags and dependency relations is chosen
for the ablation study.

5.2.3 Corpora Combinations

The aggregation of all the corpora mapped to our subset of ISO 24617-2 is not necessarily the best one, as
the distributions of DA categories varies from corpus to corpus. Consequently, we also present results on
the test sets for the models trained solely on SWDA and AMI; as well as perform an ablation experiment
removing one corpus at a time. The best performing model from the previous subsection (1-2-grams,
previous DA-tag, indexed POS-tags, and indexed dependency relations) is used for the study. The results
of these experiments are reported in Table 6.

While the best results for Dialog Bank are achieved considering all the corpora, for CAPC the best
results are achieved by removing MapTask. For S-Logs, on the other hand, the best performing corpora
combination is all except VerbMobil. However, the performance differences from the models trained
on all corpora are not statistically signiﬁcant. Training DA taggers solely on SWDA and AMI – the
largest and the most diverse corpora – yields performances inferior to the combination of all the corpora.
From the table, we can also observe that these two corpora – SWDA and AMI – contribute most to
the performance, as removing them affects the performance the most. On the other hand, removing the
smaller datasets – BT Oasis, MapTask, and VerbMobil – affects the performance less.

6 Conclusions

We have presented an effective methodology for corpora aggregation for domain-independent Dialogue
Act Tagging on a subset of the ISO 24617-2 annotation. We have also reported an accurate evaluation

of our approach on both in-domain and out-of-domain datasets, proving that the described DA tagging
technique is indeed independent from the underlying scheme and task of the annotated corpora. Fi-
nally, the machine learning technique used for DA tagging was tested on a popular DA tagging task (the
Switchboard corpus), obtaining very close to state-of-the-art results.

This work represents one of the ﬁrst attempts to use an ISO compliant DA scheme for a real-life ap-
plication, as well as one of the ﬁrst structured approaches for evaluation of dialogue resources annotated
with this taxonomy.

Research on available training resources is one of the ﬁrst things to look forward to, since the current
data proved to be effective, but also presented numerous drawbacks (lack of adequate coverage for the
Feedback dimension, imbalanced DAs, lack of context-aware communicative functions). We plan to
make our resource continue to grow in the future by adding and mapping additional corpora, such as the
MRDA (Shriberg et al., 2004) corpus.
