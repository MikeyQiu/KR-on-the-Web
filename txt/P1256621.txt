Abstract

The rapid growth of documents across the web has necessitated ﬁnding means of discarding re-
dundant documents and retaining novel ones. Capturing redundancy is challenging as it may
involve investigating at a deep semantic level. Techniques for detecting such semantic redun-
dancy at the document level are scarce. In this work we propose a deep Convolutional Neural
Network (CNN) based model to classify a document as novel or redundant with respect to a set of
relevant documents already seen by the system. The system is simple and does not require man-
ual feature engineering. Our novel scheme encodes relevant and relative information from both
source and target texts to generate an intermediate representation for which we coin the name
Relative Document Vector (RDV). The proposed method outperforms the existing benchmark on
two document-level novelty detection datasets by a margin of ∼5% in terms of accuracy. We
further demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on a standard paraphrase detection dataset
where the paraphrased passages closely resembles semantically redundant documents.

Introduction

Document-level novelty detection implies the categorization of a document as novel if it contains sufﬁ-
cient new information with respect to whatever relevant is previously known or seen. Existing literature
on novelty detection from texts mostly followed the detection of novelty at the sentence level, i.e., to
extract the sentences that carry new information with respect to some relevant source texts (c.f. Section
2). The current work is aimed at automatically classifying an incoming document as novel or non-novel
on the basis of documents already seen by the system. We view the problem as a two-class classiﬁcation
problem in machine learning with the judgment that whether an incoming document bears sufﬁciently
new information to be labeled as novel with respect to a set of source documents. The source document
set could be seen as the memory of the reader which stores known information. Document-level novelty
detection is a crucial problem and ﬁnds application in diverse domains of language processing such as
information retrieval, document summarization, predicting impact of scholarly articles, etc. It is a com-
plex problem that comprehends lexical, syntactic, semantic and pragmatic levels of texts in conjunction
with certain characteristics like relevance, diversity, relativity, and temporality (Ghosal et al., 2018). Lit-
erature methods for novelty detection based on lexical similarity, divergence features, and information
retrieval measures, although proved effective for sentence level but could not address the document-level
comprehension needs. Our understanding of the problem led us to an assertion that a deep neural network
might be able to extract the text subtleties involved in understanding a document’s novelty. To the best
of our knowledge this is the very ﬁrst attempt to address document-level novelty detection without the
involvement of any hand-crafted features. Our approach achieves signiﬁcant performance improvement
over the existing measures on novelty detection from texts on three different datasets, thus establishing
our contention.

1.1 Motivation

Motivation behind the current work stems from the eternal quest of the inquisitive mind : new informa-
tion.

• The exponential dump of redundant information in documents across the web, which does not add
anything new to the knowledge, yet consumes valuable space and time (of readers) accentuates
identifying novel documents and discarding non-novel documents in the current context.

• Plagiarism detection in scholarly articles at the semantic level is another ambitious vision that de-
mands research attention. Methods for document-level novelty detection can aid in the investigation.

• Our survey reveals that in spite of having potential in various applications, document-level nov-
elty detection has not garnered deserved attention from the community. Also it was intriguing to
investigate how deep neural architectures could distinguish between novel and non-novel texts.

1.2 Contributions

The principal offerings of the present work could be outlined as :

1. Proposing an effective deep learning strategy for document-level novelty detection: a ﬁrst of its kind

2. Presenting an effective semantic vector representation to model information from both source and

target documents.

2 Related Works

Research in novelty mining could be traced back to the Topic Detection and Tracking (TDT) (Wayne,
1997) evaluation campaigns where the concern was to detect new events or First Story Detection (FSD)
with respect to online news streams. Techniques mostly involved grouping the news stories into clusters
and then measuring the belongingness of an incoming story to any of the clusters based on some preset
similarity threshold. Some notable contributions from TDT are (Allan et al., 1998; Yang et al., 2002;
Allan et al., 2000; Yang et al., 1998).

The task gained prominence in the novelty tracks of Text Retrieval Conferences (TREC) from 2002
to 2004 (Soboroff and Harman, 2005; Harman, 2002; Soboroff and Harman, 2003; Clarke et al., 2004)
although the focus was sentence-level novelty detection. The goal of these tracks was to highlight the rel-
evant sentences that contain novel information, given a topic and an ordered list of relevant documents.
Some interesting works in TREC were based on the sets of terms (Zhang et al., 2003a; Zhang et al.,
2003b), term translations (Collins-Thompson et al., 2002), Principal Component Analysis (PCA) vec-
tors (Ru et al., 2004), Support Vector Machine (SVM) classiﬁcation (Tomiyama et al., 2004) etc. Similar
works relied on named entities (Gabrilovich et al., 2004; Li and Croft, 2005; Zhang and Tsai, 2009),
language models (Zhang et al., 2002; Allan et al., 2003), contexts (Schiffman and McKeown, 2005),
etc. Next came the novelty sub tracks of Recognizing Textual Entailment-Text Analytics Conference
(RTE-TAC) 6 and 7 (Bentivogli et al., 2011) where Textual Entailment was viewed as one close neighbor
to sentence level novelty detection.

At the document level an interesting work was carried out by (Yang et al., 2002) via topical classi-
ﬁcation of on-line document streams and then detecting novelty of documents in each topic exploiting
the named entities. Another work by (Zhang et al., 2002) viewed novelty as an opposite characteristic
to redundancy and proposed a set of ﬁve redundancy measures ranging from the set difference, geo-
metric mean, distributional similarity in order to calculate the novelty of an incoming document with
respect to a set of memorized documents. They also presented the ﬁrst publicly available Associated
Press-Wall Street Journal (APWSJ) news dataset for document level novelty detection. (Tsai and Zhang,
2011) applied a document to sentence level framework to calculate the novelty of each sentence of a
(Karkali et al., 2013) computed
document which aggregates to detect novelty of the entire document.
novelty score based on the inverse document frequency scoring function. Another work by (Verheij et
al., 2012) presents a comparison study of different novelty detection methods evaluated on news articles

where language model based methods perform better than the cosine similarity based ones. More re-
cently (Dasgupta and Dey, 2016) conducted experiments with information entropy measure to calculate
innovativeness of a document. Each of these works evaluated their methods on separate datasets and to
the best of our knowledge except APWSJ none of these is publicly available.

Novelty detection is also studied in works related to diversity in information retrieval literature. Idea
is to retrieve relevant yet diverse documents in response to user query. The work on Maximal Marginal
Relevance (Carbonell and Goldstein, 1998) was the ﬁrst to explore diversity and relevance for novelty.
Some other notable works along this line are (Chandar and Carterette, 2013; Clarke et al., 2011; Clarke
et al., 2008).

The work that we present here signiﬁcantly differs from the existing literature as we provide a deep
neural network solution to the problem which does not depend on hand crafted features, and learns the
notion of novelty and non-novelty from the data itself.

3 Document Novelty : Challenges and Observations

Deciding the novelty of an entire document or what amount of new information makes a document
appear novel are very challenging tasks. Even more challenging since the task inherently exhibits several
text characteristics (relevance, diversity, relativity, temporality) to be addressed simultaneously. A novel
document should be relevant to context, should exhibit diversity in information content, should have
relatively more new relevant yet diverse information and is usually deemed as a temporal update over the
existing knowledge. The difﬁculty associated with the task is further exaggerated when there are a large
number of history documents against which a target document is to be judged for novelty. We propose a
possible solution that could address most of these challenges and also reduce the need of manual feature
engineering to an extent. We analyze the available benchmark sentence-level novelty detection datasets
like TREC/RTE-TAC and come up with certain observations :
(1) Named Entities (NEs) play a vital role in adjudging the relevance of a test document against its
source document(s).
(2) Semantic features play a crucial role in identifying redundancy or non-novelty. Lexical level features
(such as n-gram match) do well when there is a word-by-word match or when two texts share a fair
amount of tokens. But it fails in cases where surface form is very different yet conveys the same meaning
(paraphrases).
(3) Lexical features are sometimes efﬁcient to detect document level new information content. For e.g.,
if the source document(s) consists of information regarding the facts of a certain accident and the target
document reports the police investigation carried out afterwards-although the two documents would share
a fair amount of NEs, yet would differ in contextual information content which could be captured to a
large extent via lexical level features.

4 Dataset Description

Since our focus is on document-level novelty detection we consider only document level datasets. Exist-
ing benchmark datasets on sentence-level novelty detection are not suited to our experimental framework.
We also evaluate our approach on the standard Webis Crowd Paraphrase Corpus (Webis CPC) (Burrows
et al., 2013) whose inherent semantic richness sets a competitive benchmark for our method.

4.1 APWSJ Corpus

The APWSJ data consists of news articles from Associated Press (AP) and Wall Street Journal (WSJ)
corpus covering the same time period (1988 to 1990) and many on the same topics, guaranteeing some
redundancy in the document stream. Similar to (Zhang et al., 2002) we use the documents within the
designated 33 topics1 with redundancy judgments by the assessors. The dataset was meant to ﬁlter
superﬂuous documents in a retrieval scenario and deliver only the documents having redundancy score
below a calculated threshold. Documents for each topic were delivered in a chronological manner and

1http://www.cs.cmu.edu/ yiz/research/NoveltyData/

the assessors provided two degrees of judgments on the non-novel documents: absolute redundant or
somewhat redundant based on prior documents. The unmarked documents were treated as novel.

4.2 Webis CPC

The Webis Crowd Paraphrase Corpus 2011 (Webis-CPC-11) contains 7,859 candidate paraphrases ob-
tained from the Mechanical Turk crowdsourcing. The corpus2 is made up of 4,067 accepted paraphrases,
3,792 rejected non-paraphrases, and the original texts. For our experiment we assume the original texts as
the source document and the corresponding candidate paraphrase/non-paraphrase as the target document.
We hypothesize that a paraphrased document would not contain any new information and hence could
be treated as non-novel whereas a non-paraphrased candidate could be taken as novel. Basically we seek
to investigate the viability of our proposed method to discover the semantically redundant documents
(paraphrases) from this dataset.

4.3 TAP-DLND 1.0

We experiment with this recent benchmark resource for document-level novelty detection (DLND)
(Ghosal et al., 2018). The dataset3 is balanced and consists of 2,736 novel documents and 2,704 non-
novel documents. For each novel/non-novel document there are three source documents against which
the target document is annotated. The state of novelty for each target document is to be measured against
those source documents i.e. once the system has already seen the designated source documents for a
particular event, it is to judge whether an incoming on-topic document is novel or not. The semantic
nature of the dataset makes it an ideal candidate for our experiments.

5 Proposed Model

Having an acceptable benchmark dataset avaialable at our end, instead of handcrafting the similar-
ity/divergence based features,we try to learn feature representations from a target document with respect
to the source document(s) using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Our proposed model is based
on a recent sentence embedding paradigm proposed by (Conneau et al., 2017). We leverage their idea
and create a representation of the relevant target document relative to the designated source document(s)
and call it as the Relative Document Vector (RDV)4. We then train a Convolutional Neural Network
(CNN) with the RDV of the target documents in the similar line of (Kim, 2014), and ﬁnally classify
a document as novel or non-novel with respect to its source documents (Figure 1). Although there are
document embedding models available, our method is speciﬁcally tailored to address the relativity and
diversity criteria which is fundamental to the deﬁnition of novelty. Here T1 is the target document whose
state of novelty is to be determined against the source document(s) S1, S2, ...SM i.e. to say the objec-
tive is to automatically ﬁgure out whether T1 is novel or not once the machine has already seen/scanned
S1, S2, ...SM . Our model assumes that the documents are relevant to a context. We reserve Temporality
to be explored in a later work.

5.1 Embedding and Sentence Encoder

The task of Novelty Detection requires high-level understanding and reasoning about semantic relation-
ships within texts. Textual Entailment or Natural Language Inference is one such task which exhibits
such complex semantic interactions. Following from (Conneau et al., 2017) we therefore employ a
sentence encoder based on a bi-directional Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) architecture with max
pooling, trained on the large-scale Stanford Natural Language Inference (SNLI) dataset (Bowman et
al., 2015). SNLI entries supposedly captures rich semantic associations between the text pairs (entail-
ment/inference relationships between premise and hypothesis). The output of our sentence encoder is

3http://www.iitp.ac.in/ ai-nlp-ml/resources.html
4We call our document vector relative, as we desire to encode the relative new information of a target document w.r.t. its

relevant source document(s)

a ﬁxed sized (2048 dimension) sentence embedding of each of the sentences5 of the input document
(source or target).

5.1.1 BiLSTM with max pooling
For a sequence of T words {wt}t−1,...,T , a bidirectional LSTM computes a set of T vectors {ht}t. For
t ∈ [1, ..., T ], ht, is the concatenation of a forward LSTM and a backward LSTM that read the sentences
in two opposite directions. We combine the varying number of {ht}t to form a ﬁxed-size vector by
selecting the maximum value over each dimension of the hidden units (max pooling).

5.1.2 Training the sentence encoder
We follow the generic SNLI training scheme of (Conneau et al., 2017). The semantic nature of SNLI
corpus makes it a good candidate for learning universal sentence embeddings in a supervised way to
capture universally useful features. The training6 on SNLI is done using the shared sentence encoder
that outputs a representation for the premise p and hypothesis h (Figure 1). The representations are
further concatenated as:

[p, h, |p − h|, p ∗ h]

to form a resulting vector, which captures information from both the premise and hypothesis, and is fed
into a 3-class classiﬁer7 (multi-layer perceptron with 1 hidden layer of 512 units) consisting of multiple
fully-connected layers culminating into a softmax layer.

5split using NLTK
6SGD with a learning rate of 0.1 and a weight decay of 0.99 are used. At each epoch, the learning rate is divided by 5 if
the development accuracy decreases. Training is done with a mini-batch size of 64. GloVe vectors trained on Common Crawl
840B (https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/) with 300 dimensions are used as ﬁxed word embeddings.

7SNLI has 3 classes of sentence-pair judgments: neutral, contradiction, entailment

5.2 Comparator Module

This module ﬁnds the closest sentence in the source document(s) with respect to each of the target
sentences. Thus each sentence (tk) in a target document (T ) is mapped to its nearest source sentence
(sij) where i denotes the source document and j signiﬁes the sentence position within that document.
The encoder module outputs a ﬁxed-length vector representation ak for the target sentence tk and bij for
any source sentence sij. We deﬁne closeness as the maximum of cosine similarity between the vectors
ak and bij.

scosine(−→ak, −→

bij) =

−→ak.−→
bij
|−→ak||−→
bij|

Thus we have a mapping relationship for each sentence in the target document with one of the source
sentences.

bij → ak

where ak has the max. cosine similarity with bij.

5.3 Aggregator module

This module aggregates the mappings produced in the comparator module to generate a document ma-
trix. The mapping of a target sentence tk to its closest source sentence sij is rendered by constructing
a feature vector that captures the relation between the source and the target. This feature vector con-
sists of the concatenation of the two sentence embeddings corresponding to tk and sij, their absolute
element-wise difference, and their element-wise product (Mou et al., 2016). The ﬁrst heuristic follows
the most standard procedure of the Siamese architecture, while the latter two are certain measures of
”similarity” or ”closeness”. Thus, the Relative Sentence Vector (RSV) corresponding to a target sentence
tk is represented as :

RSVk = [ak, bij, |ak − bij|, ak ∗ bij]

where comma (,) refers to the column vector concatenation. This representation is inspired from the word
embedding studies (Mikolov et al., 2013) where the linear offset of vectors is seen to capture semantic
relationships between the two words. (Mou et al., 2016) successfully leveraged this idea for modeling
sentence-pair relationships which we alleviate to model documents. Thus for each target sentence tk we
compute the RSV and aggregate them to form the Relative Document Vector (RDV) of target document
Tj with respect to the source documents(s) Si. Aggregation is realized as a slot ﬁlling task to shape
the document matrix8 or RDV of dimension N X 4D where N is the number of sentences in a target
document (padded when necessary) and D is the sentence embedding dimension produced by the en-
coder module. Our rationale behind the RDV-CNN is: The operators: absolute element-wise difference
and product would result in such a vector composition for non-novel sentences which would manifest
’closeness’ whereas for novel sentences would manifest ’diversity’; the aggregation of which would aid
in the interpretation of document level novelty or redundancy by a deep neural network. We chose CNN
due to its inherent ability to automatically extract features from distinct representations.

5.4 CNN module
The document matrix or the RDV now becomes the input to a CNN9 for training and subsequent clas-
siﬁcation of a target document as novel or non-novel with respect to its source document(s). The CNN
component is similar to the one as used in (Kim, 2014) for sentence classiﬁcation. The notable difference
is in the usage of word embedding. Instead of word2vec embeddings we use here the relative sentence
embeddings of dimension 4D (kth sentence in the document is represented by an embedding vector
RSVk ∈ RD). We experiment with the NON-STATICTEXT channel variant (embeddings gets updated
during training) of the CNN.
For each possible input channel, a given document is transformed into a tensor of ﬁxed length N (padded

with zero-tensors wherever necessary to tackle variable sentence lengths) by concatenating the relative
sentence embeddings.

RSV1:N = RSV1 ⊕ RSV2 ⊕ RSV3 ⊕ ..... ⊕ RSVN

where ⊕ is the concatenation operator. To extract local features10, convolution operation is applied.
Convolution operation involves a ﬁlter, W ∈ RHD, which is convolved with a window of H embeddings
to produce a local feature for the H target sentences. A local feature, ck is generated from a window
of embeddings RSVk:k+H−1 by applying a non-linear function (such as hyperbolic tangent) over the
convoluted output. Mathematically,

ck = f (W.RSVk:k+H−1 + b)

where b ∈ R is the bias and f is the non-linear function. This operation is applied to each possible
window of H target sentences to produce a feature map (c) for the window size H.

c = [c1, c2, c3, ...., cN −H+1]

A global feature is then obtained by applying max-pooling operation (Collobert et al., 2011) over the
feature map. The idea behind max-pooling is to capture the most important feature-one with the highest
value -for each feature map. We describe the process by which one feature is extracted from one ﬁlter
(red bordered portions in Figure 1 illustrate the case of H = 4). The model uses multiple ﬁlters for each
ﬁlter size to obtain multiple features representing the text. These features form the penultimate layer and
are passed to a fully connected feed forward layer (with number of hidden units set to 100) followed by
a SoftMax layer whose output is the probability distribution over the labels (novel or non-novel).

6 Results and Discussion

We proceed with the intuition: redundancy recognition would eventually lead us to novelty detection.
The three datasets we use represent the most comprehensive resources that are publicly available and
could be effectively used for document-level novelty detection.

6.1 On APWSJ: a document-level novelty detection dataset

We take upon the results reported by (Zhang et al., 2002) on APWSJ and use similar metrics to report
the performance of our approach. Table 1 exhibits the effect of different redundancy measures (taken
from (Zhang et al., 2002)) on APWSJ considering both absolutely redundant and somewhat redundant
documents as redundant or non-novel. Our RDV-CNN approach delivers comparable performance in a
10-fold cross-validation classiﬁcation setting. Although the system suffers in identifying the redundant
documents but succeeds to minimize the errors committed. It signiﬁes the afﬁnity of our architecture
towards detecting novel documents. It is to be noted here that (Zhang et al., 2002) conducted their ex-
periments in an information ﬁltering scenario using some thresholding scheme, where the redundant or
non-novel documents were to be ﬁltered from being delivered (Not Delivered). Only the novel docu-
ments were to be Delivered by the retrieval system. No learning was involved. Even APWSJ corpus was
developed to support this Information Retrieval (IR) perspective of retrieving novel documents. Hence,
there is a huge class imbalance. The presence of a relatively less number of non-novel documents in
APWSJ (only 9.07%) and also that somewhat redundant documents are considered as redundant11 in
our experiment may have hindered the learning of redundant patterns by our system. However, the supe-
riority of our approach is established when we experiment with two other balanced datasets that closely
approximates the semantic level redundancy we aim to capture.

6.2 On Webis-CPC-11: a corpus for paraphrase detection (simulating non-novelty)

As stated earlier, we deem paraphrase detection as one close simulation of semantic level redundancy
(non-novelty) detection. With this view we subject our model to detect passage-level paraphrase pairs

10features speciﬁc to a region in case of images or window of target sentences
11as originally considered in (Zhang et al., 2002). We replicate the same experimental conditions for fair comparison.

Except for RDV-CNN, all other numbers are taken from (Zhang et al., 2002)

from Webis-CPC-11. We investigate similar evaluation systems for novelty detection as carried out
in (Ghosal et al., 2018). The three novelty detection measures (Set Difference, Geometric Distance,
Language Model), originally formulated by (Zhang et al., 2002) and another based on Inverse Document
Frequency (IDF) by (Karkali et al., 2013) are our benchmarks for evaluation. Instead of setting a ﬁxed
threshold12 as in these works we train a Logistic Regression (LR) classiﬁer based on those measures to
automatically determine the decision boundary.
Baseline 1: As a baseline we take state-of-the-art document embedding (Paragraph Vector) technique
by (Le and Mikolov, 2014) for document representation; concatenate the source and target document
vectors and pass it to LR.
Baseline 2: Both the target and source sentence encodings13 are passed to separate BiLSTM layers; the
two resultant vectors are concatenated and passed to a Multi Layered Perceptron (MLP) with hidden dim
of 2048 followed by classiﬁcation via softmax.
Table 2 clearly shows that our RDV-CNN outperforms all the measures and baselines and maintains a
signiﬁcant supremacy to detect semantic-level redundant passages.

6.3 On TAP-DLND 1.0: a corpus for document-level novelty detection

We experiment with the recently published TAP-DLND 1.0 corpus for our document level novelty detec-
tion experiments. TAP-DLND 1.0 is well balanced and consists of a fair share of different levels (lexical
as well as semantic) of textual views for both novel and non-novel documents. Since our objective here is
to identify both novel and non-novel documents we report results for each class. We take the same base-
line as we use for Webis-CPC in the previous section. Our approach outperforms the popular semantic
document embedding technique Paragraph Vector and another deep neural baseline (BiLSTM+MLP) by
a considerable margin(12% and 6% in terms of accuracy, respectively). We also re-execute the other nov-
elty detection measures by (Zhang et al., 2002) (Set Difference, Geometric Distance, Language Model)
and (Karkali et al., 2013) (IDF) on TAP-DLND 1.0 and report the results. Our RDV-CNN even surpasses

the current benchmark (Ghosal et al., 2018) on TAP-DLND 1.0 by a considerable margin in identifying
both novel and non-novel documents. Figure 2 shows the consistency and edge of our approach over
other measures. This behavior we attribute to our customized architecture of mapping each target sen-

tence to the nearest source sentence to produce a relative document representation being input to a CNN.
The CNN then extracts the features from the relative document representation and ﬁnally classiﬁes the
incoming document. Results signify that our network is able to learn the complex semantic interactions
between source and target information necessary to conclude upon the state of novelty of a document.
It is to be noted that except (Ghosal et al., 2018) and our baselines, all other measures that we consider
for comparison were developed with an information retrieval perspective. The p-values for F1 score
produced by 20 runs of our system against the baseline are less than 0.05 and hence the improvement is
statistically signiﬁcant and unlikely to be observed by chance in 95% conﬁdence interval.

6.4 Observations and Analysis

We scrutinize the results and arrive to the following observations:
(1) The RDV-CNN customized architecture of mapping each target sentence to the nearest source sen-
tence for producing a relative document representation tackles the relativity criterion required for the
problem. It facilitates CNN to extract the relevant features from the relative document representation
which accounts for the better performance across the two datasets.
(2) Lexical approaches perform closer to our approach in detecting paraphrase pairs. This is due to the
higher number of Named Entities (NEs) shared between those literary texts in Webis-CPC-11.
(3) Poor recall for non-novel class by IDF measure (Karkali et al., 2013) is due to the existence of many

new entity terms in the target documents for TAP-DLND 1.0.
(4) Lexical overlap based measures performs poorly in identifying non-novel documents in TAP-DLND
1.0. This behavior approves our discussion in Section 3 that we need semantic ﬂair to address non-
novelty. RDV-CNN bridges the gap.
(5) The deep baselines did not appear as promising to capture the semantic interactions between source
and target sentences as did RDV-CNN (Section 5.3).
(6) We thoroughly examined our gold and predicted class labels. Errors committed by our system are
mostly due to presence of multiple source premise sentence for a target sentence. Our RDV-CNN could
capture only one premise for a target sentence and map them. We intend to accommodate multiple
premises in RDV deﬁnition in our future work.
(7) The universal sentence encoding generated by BiLSTM trained on SNLI are sometimes unable to
capture the complex semantic interactions between source and target sentences. This mostly occurred
for new NEs and out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words.

7 Conclusion and Future work

In this work we put forward a deep learning solution for document-level novelty detection. Our deep
neural network succeeds in extracting the text subtleties essential for this complex task. The system
displays comparable potential on an existing resource, signiﬁcant performance gain over the high-level
paraphrase detection task and outperforms the state-of-the-art on an apt dataset. Analysis of results
validates our claim that semantic features play a vital role in identifying semantic level redundancy
aka non-novelty whereas relevant lexical divergence is a good indicator of novelty. However, we agree
that given a large number of documents as source our architecture would be computationally expensive
which we intend to mitigate. Also we desire to incorporate relevance judgment as an essential component
our architecture. Our future agenda includes investigating the role of attention mechanism in creating
the Relative Document Vector as an intermediate representation of target documents for document-level
novelty detection.
