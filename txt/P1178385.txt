Abstract

We propose a deep generative Markov State Model (DeepGenMSM) learning
framework for inference of metastable dynamical systems and prediction of tra-
jectories. After unsupervised training on time series data, the model contains (i)
a probabilistic encoder that maps from high-dimensional conﬁguration space to a
small-sized vector indicating the membership to metastable (long-lived) states, (ii)
a Markov chain that governs the transitions between metastable states and facili-
tates analysis of the long-time dynamics, and (iii) a generative part that samples
the conditional distribution of conﬁgurations in the next time step. The model
can be operated in a recursive fashion to generate trajectories to predict the sys-
tem evolution from a deﬁned starting state and propose new conﬁgurations. The
DeepGenMSM is demonstrated to provide accurate estimates of the long-time ki-
netics and generate valid distributions for molecular dynamics (MD) benchmark
systems. Remarkably, we show that DeepGenMSMs are able to make long time-
steps in molecular conﬁguration space and generate physically realistic structures
in regions that were not seen in training data.

Introduction

Complex dynamical systems that exhibit events on vastly different timescales are ubiquitous in sci-
ence and engineering. For example, molecular dynamics (MD) of biomolecules involve fast vibra-
tions on the timescales of 10−15 seconds, while their biological function is often related to the rare
switching events between long-lived states on timescales of 10−3 seconds or longer. In weather and
climate systems, local ﬂuctuations in temperature and pressure ﬁelds occur within minutes or hours,
while global changes are often subject to periodic motion and drift over years or decades. Primary
goals in the analysis of complex dynamical systems include:

1. Deriving an interpretable model of the essential long-time dynamical properties of these

systems, such as the stationary behavior or lifetimes/cycle times of slow processes.

2. Simulating the dynamical system, e.g., to predict the system’s future evolution or to sample

previously unobserved system conﬁgurations.

A state-of-the-art approach for the ﬁrst goal is to learn a Markovian model from time-series data,
which is theoretically justiﬁed by the fact that physical systems are inherently Markovian. In prac-
tice, the long-time behavior of dynamical systems can be accurately described in a Markovian model
when suitable features or variables are used, and when the time resolution of the model is sufﬁciently
coarse such that the time-evolution can be represented with a manageable number of dynamical
modes [25, 11]. In stochastic dynamical systems, such as MD simulation, variants of Markov state
models (MSMs) are commonly used [3, 24, 22]. In MSMs, the conﬁguration space is discretized,
e.g., using a clustering method, and the dynamics between clusters are then described by a matrix

of transition probabilities [22]. The analogous approach for deterministic dynamical systems such
as complex ﬂuid ﬂows is called Koopman analysis, where time propagation is approximated by a
linear model in a suitable function space transformation of the ﬂow variables [16, 26, 29, 4]. The
recently proposed VAMPnets learn an optimal feature transformation from full conﬁguration space
to a low-dimensional latent space in which the Markovian model is built by variational optimization
of a neural network [15]. When the VAMPnet has a probabilistic output (e.g. SoftMax layer), the
Markovian model conserves probability, but is not guaranteed to be a valid transition probability
matrix with nonnegative elements. A related work for deterministic dynamical systems is Extended
Dynamic Mode Decomposition with dictionary learning [13]. All of these methods are purely ana-
lytic, i.e. they learn a reduced model of the dynamical system underlying the observed time series,
but they miss a generative part that could be used to sample new time series in the high-dimensional
conﬁguration space.

Recently, several learning frameworks for dynamical systems have been proposed that partially ad-
dress the second goal by including a decoder from the latent space back to the space of input features.
Most of these methods primarily aim at obtaining a low-dimensional latent space that encodes the
long-time behavior of the system, and the decoder takes the role of deﬁning or regularizing the learn-
ing problem [30, 8, 14, 19, 23]. In particular none of these models have demonstrated the ability to
generate viable structures in the high-dimensional conﬁguration space, such as a molecular struc-
ture with realistic atom positions in 3D. Finally, some of these models learn a linear model of the
long-timescale dynamics [14, 19], but none of them provide a probabilistic dynamical model that
can be employed in a Bayesian framework. Learning the correct long-time dynamical behavior with
a generative dynamical model is difﬁcult, as demonstrated in [8].

Here, we address these aforementioned gaps by providing a deep learning framework that learns,
based on time-series data, the following components:

1. Probabilistic encodings of the input conﬁguration to a low-dimensional latent space by

neural networks, xt → χ(xt).

2. A true transition probability matrix K describing the system dynamics in latent space for a

ﬁxed time-lag τ :

E [χ(xt+τ )] = E (cid:2)K(cid:62)(τ )χ(xt)(cid:3) .
The probabilistic nature of the method allows us to train it with likelihood maximization
and embed it into a Bayesian framework. In our benchmarks, the transition probability
matrix approximates the long-time behavior of the underlying dynamical system with high
accuracy.

3. A generative model from latent vectors back to conﬁgurations, allowing us to sample the
transition density P(xt+τ |xt) and thus propagate the model in conﬁguration space. We
show for the ﬁrst time that this allows us to sample genuinely new and valid molecular
structures that have not been included in the training data. This makes the method promis-
ing for performing active learning in MD [2, 21], and to predict the future evolution of the
system in other contexts.

2 Deep Generative Markov State Models

Given two conﬁgurations x, y ∈ Rd, where Rd is a potentially high-dimensional space of system
conﬁgurations (e.g. the positions of atoms in a molecular system), Markovian dynamics are deﬁned
by the transition density P(xt+τ = y|xt = x). Here we represent the transition density between m
states in the following form (Fig. 1):

P(xt+τ = y|xt = x) = χ(x)(cid:62)q(y; τ ) =

χi(x)qi(y; τ ).

(1)

m
(cid:88)

i=1

Here, χ(x)(cid:62) = [χ1(x), ..., χm(x)] represent the probability of conﬁguration x to be in a metastable
(long-lived) state i

Consequently, these functions are nonnegative (χi(x) ≥ 0∀x) and sum up to one ((cid:80)
i χi(x) = 1∀x).
The functions χ(x) can, e.g., be represented by a neural network mapping from Rd to Rm with a

χi(x) = P(xt ∈ state i | xt = x).

Figure 1: Schematic of Deep Generative Markov State Models (DeepGenMSMs) and the rewiring
trick. The function χ, here represented by neural networks, maps the time-lagged input conﬁgura-
tions to metastable states whose dynamics are governed by a transition probability matrix K. The
generator samples the distribution xt+τ ∼ q by employing a generative network that can produce
novel conﬁgurations (or by resampling xt+τ in DeepResampleMSMs). The rewiring trick consists
of reconnecting the probabilistic networks q and χ such that the time propagation in latent space
can be sampled: From the latent state χ(xt), we generate a time-lagged conﬁguration xt+τ using
q, and then transform it back to the latent space, χ(xt+τ ). Each application of the rewired net-
work samples the latent space transitions, thus providing the statistics to estimate the Markov model
transition matrix K(τ ), which is needed for analysis. This trick allows K(τ ) to be estimated with
desired constraints, such as detailed balance.

SoftMax output layer. Additionally, we have the probability densities
qi(y; τ ) = P(xt+τ = y|xt ∈ state i)
that deﬁne the probability density of the system to “land” at conﬁguration y after making one time-
step. We thus brieﬂy call them “landing densities”.

2.1 Kinetics

Before addressing how to estimate χ and q from data, we describe how to perform the standard
calculations and analyses that are common in the Markov modeling ﬁeld for a model of the form
(1).

In Markov modeling, one is typically interested in the kinetics of the system, i.e.
the long-time
behavior of the dynamics. This is captured by the elements of the transition matrix K = [kij]
between metastable states. K can be computed as follows: the product of the probability density
to jump from metastable i to a conﬁguration y and the probability that this conﬁguration belongs to
metastable state j, integrated over the whole conﬁguration space.

kij(τ ) =

qi(y; τ )χj(y) dy.

(2)

(cid:90)

y

Practically, this calculation is implemented via the “rewiring trick” shown in Fig. 1, where the
conﬁguration space integral is approximated by drawing samples from the generator. The estimated
probabilistic functions q and χ deﬁne, by construction, a valid transition probability matrix K,
i.e. kij ≥ 0 and (cid:80)
j kij = 1. As a result, the proposed models have a structural advantage over
other high-accuracy Markov state modeling approaches that deﬁne metastable states in a fuzzy or
probabilistic manner but do not guarantee a valid transition matrix [12, 15] (See Supplementary
Material for more details.).

The stationary (equilibrium) probabilities of the metastable states are given by the vector π = [πi]
that solves the eigenvalue problem with eigenvalue λ1 = 1:

and the stationary (equilibrium) distribution in conﬁguration space is given by:

π = K(cid:62)π,

µ(y) =

πiqi(y; τ ) = π(cid:62)q(y; τ ).

(cid:88)

i

Finally, for a ﬁxed deﬁnition of states via χ, the self-consistency of Markov models may be tested
using the Chapman-Kolmogorov equation

Kn(τ ) ≈ K(nτ )

which involves estimating the functions q(y; nτ ) at different lag times nτ and comparing the re-
sulting transition matrices with the nth power of the transition matrix obtained at lag time τ . A
consequence of Eq. (5) is that the relaxation times

ti(τ ) = −

τ
log |λi(τ )|

are independent of the lag time τ at which K is estimated [27]. Here, λi with i = 2, ..., m are the
nontrivial eigenvalues of K.

2.2 Maximum Likelihood (ML) learning of DeepResampleMSM

Given trajectories {xt}t=1,...,T , how do we estimate the membership probabilities χ(x), and how
do we learn and sample the landing densities q(y)? We start with a model, where q(y) are di-
rectly derived from the observed (empirical) observations, i.e. they are point densities on the input
conﬁgurations {xt}, given by:

1
¯γi
Here, ρ(y) is the empirical distribution, which in the case of ﬁnite sample size is simply ρ(y) =
t=1 δ(y − xt+τ ), and γi(y) is a trainable weighting function. The normalization factor

γi(y)ρ(y).

qi(y) =

t=1 γi(xt+τ ) = Ey∼ρ1[γi(y)] ensures (cid:82)

Now we can optimize χi and γi by maximizing the likelihood (ML) of generating the pairs
(xt, xt+τ ) observed in the data. The log-likelihood is given by:

and is maximized to train a deep MSM with the structure shown in Fig. 1.

i=1

Alternatively, we can optimize χi and γi using the Variational Approach for Markov Processes
(VAMP) [31]. However, we found the ML approach to perform signiﬁcantly better in our tests, and
we thus include the VAMP training approach only in the Supplementary Material without elaborat-
ing on it further.

Given the networks χ and γ, we compute q from Eq. (7). Employing the rewiring trick shown in
Fig. 1 results in computing the transition matrix by a simple average over all conﬁgurations:

The deep MSMs described in this section are neural network generalizations of traditional MSMs
– they learn a mapping from conﬁgurations to metastable states, where they aim obtaining a good
approximation of the kinetics of the underlying dynamical system, by means of the transition matrix
K. However, since the landing distribution q in these methods is derived from the empirical distribu-
tion (7), any generated trajectory will only resample conﬁgurations from the input data. To highlight
this property, we will refer to the deep MSMs with the present methodology as DeepResampleMSM.

2.3 Energy Distance learning of DeepGenMSM

In contrast to DeepResampleMSM, we now want to learn deep generative MSM (DeepGenMSM),
which can be used to generate trajectories that do not only resample from input data, but can produce
genuinely new conﬁgurations. To this end, we train a generative model to mimic the empirical
distribution qi(y):

y = G(ei, (cid:15)),
(10)
where the vector ei ∈ Rm is a one-hot encoding of the metastable state, and (cid:15) is a i.i.d. random
vector where each component samples from a Gaussian normal distribution.

Here we train the generator G by minimizing the conditional Energy Distance (ED), whose choice is
motivated in the Supplementary Material. The standard ED, introduced in [28], is a metric between
the distributions of random vectors, deﬁned as

DE (P(x), P(y)) = E [2 (cid:107)x − y(cid:107) − (cid:107)x − x(cid:48)(cid:107) − (cid:107)y − y(cid:48)(cid:107)]

(11)

for two real-valued random variables x and y. x, x(cid:48), y, y(cid:48) are independently distributed according to
the distributions of x, y. Based on this metric, we introduce the conditional energy distance between
the transition density of the system and that of the generative model:

D (cid:44) E [DE (P(xt+τ |xt), P(ˆxt+τ |xt)) |xt]

= E (cid:2)2 (cid:107)ˆxt+τ − xt+τ (cid:107) − (cid:13)

(cid:13)ˆxt+τ − ˆx(cid:48)

(cid:13)

(cid:13)xt+τ − x(cid:48)

t+τ

(cid:13)
(cid:3)
(cid:13)

(12)

t+τ are distributed according to the transition density for given xt and ˆxt+τ , ˆx(cid:48)

Here xt+τ and x(cid:48)
t+τ
are independent outputs of the generative model conditioned on xt. Implementing the expectation
value with an empirical average results in an estimate for D that is unbiased, up to an additive
constant. We train G to minimize D. See Supplementary Material for detailed derivations and the
training algorithm used.

After training, the transition matrix can be obtained by using the rewiring trick (Fig. 1), where the
conﬁguration space integral is sampled by generating samples from the generator:

[K]ij = E(cid:15) [χj (G(ei, (cid:15)))] .

(13)

3 Results

Below we establish our framework by applying it to two well-deﬁned benchmark systems that ex-
hibit metastable stochastic dynamics. We validate the stationary distribution and kinetics by comput-
ing χ(x), q(y), the stationary distribution µ(y) and the relaxation times ti(τ ) and comparing them
with reference solutions. We will also test the abilities of DeepGenMSMs to generate physically
valid molecular conﬁgurations.

The networks were implemented using PyTorch [20] and Tensorﬂow [6]. For the full code and all
details about the neural network architecture, hyper-parameters and training algorithm, please refer

3.1 Diffusion in Prinz potential

We ﬁrst apply our framework to the time-discretized diffusion process xt+∆t = −∆t ∇V (xt) +
√
2∆t ˙ηt with ∆t = 0.01 in the Prinz potential V (xt) introduced in [22] (Fig. 2a). For this system
we know exact results for benchmarking: the stationary distribution and relaxation timescales (black
lines in Fig. 2b,c) and the transition density (Fig. 2d). We simulate trajectories of lengths 250, 000
and 125, 000 time steps for training and validation, respectively. For all methods, we repeat the data
generation and model estimation process 10 times and compute mean and standard deviations for
all quantities of interest, which thus represent the mean and variance of the estimators.

The functions χ, γ and G are represented with densely connected neural networks. The details of
the architecture and the training procedure can be found in the Supplementary Information.

We compare DeepResampleMSMs and DeepGenMSMs with standard MSMs using four or ten
states obtained with k-means clustering. Note that standard MSMs do not directly operate on con-
ﬁguration space. When using an MSM, the transition density (Eq. 1) is thus simulated by:

∼Ki,∗−→ j
i.e., we ﬁnd the cluster i associated with a conﬁguration xt, which is deterministic for regular MSMs,
then sample the cluster j at the next time-step, and sample from the conditional distribution of
conﬁgurations in cluster j to generate xt+τ .

∼ρj (y)
−→ xt+τ ,

χ(xt)

Both DeepResampleMSMs trained with the ML method and standard MSMs can reproduce the
stationary distribution within statistical uncertainty (Fig. 2b). For long lag times τ , all methods con-
verge from below to the correct relaxation timescales (Fig. 2c), as expected from theory [22, 18].
When using equally many states (here: four), the DeepResampleMSM has a much lower bias in the
relaxation timescales than the standard MSM. This is expected from approximation theory, as the
DeepResampleMSMs represents the four metastable states with a meaningful, smooth membership
functions χ(xt), while the four-state MSM cuts the memberships hard at boundaries with low sam-
ple density (Supplementary Fig. 1). When increasing the number of metastable states, the bias of
all estimators will reduce. An MSM with ten states is needed to perform approximately equal to a
four-state DeepResampleMSM (Fig. 2c). All subsequent analyses use a lag time of τ = 5.

ML-ED training. (a) Stationary distribution. (b-d) Transition densities. (e) Relaxation timescales.

The DeepResampleMSM generates a transition density that is very similar to the exact density,
while the MSM transition densities are coarse-grained by virtue of the fact that χ(xt) performs a
hard clustering in an MSM (Fig. 2d). This impression is conﬁrmed when computing the Kullback-
Leibler divergence of the distributions (Fig. 2e).

Encouraged by the accurate results of DeepResampleMSMs, we now train DeepGenMSM, either
by training both the χ and q networks by minimizing the energy distance (ED), or by taking χ
from a ML-trained DeepResampleMSM and only training the q network by minimizing the energy
distance (ML-ED). The stationary densities, relaxation timescales and transition densities can still
be approximated in these settings, although the DeepGenMSMs exhibit larger statistical ﬂuctuations
than the resampling MSMs (Fig. 3). ML-ED appears to perform slightly better than ED alone, likely
because reusing χ from the ML training makes the problem of training the generator easier.

For a one-dimensional example like the Prinz potential, learning a generative model does not provide
any added value, as the distributions can be well approximated by the empirical distributions. The
fact that we can still get approximately correct results for stationary, kinetics and dynamical proper-
ties encourages us to use DeepGenMSMs for a higher-dimensional example, where the generation
of conﬁgurations is a hard problem.

3.2 Alanine dipeptide

We use explicit-solvent MD simulations of Alanine dipeptide as a second example. Our aim is
the learn stationary and kinetic properties, but especially to learn a generative model that generates
genuinely novel but physically meaningful conﬁgurations. One 250 ns trajectory with a storage
interval of 1 ps is used and split 80%/20% for training and validation – see [15] for details of the
simulation setup. We characterize all structures by the three-dimensional Cartesian coordinates of
the heavy atoms, resulting in a 30 dimensional conﬁguration space. While we do not have exact
results for Alanine dipeptide, the system is small enough and well enough sampled, such that high-

quality estimates of stationary and kinetic properties can be obtained from a very ﬁne MSM [22].
We therefore deﬁne an MSM build on 400 equally sized grid areas in the (φ, ψ)-plane as a reference
at a lag time of τ = 25 ps that has been validated by established methods [22].

Neural network and training details are again found at the git repository and in the Supplementary
Information.

For comparison with deep MSMs, we build two standard MSMs following a state of the art protocol:
we transform input conﬁgurations with a kinetic map preserving 95% of the cumulative kinetic
variance [17], followed by k-means clustering, where k = 6 and k = 100 are used.

DeepResampleMSM trained with ML method approximate the stationary distribution very well (Fig.
4a). The reference MSM assigns a slightly lower weight to the lowest-populated state 6, but other-
wise the data, reference distribution and deep MSM distribution are visually indistinguishable. The
relaxation timescales estimated by a six-state DeepResampleMSM are signiﬁcantly better than with
six-state standard MSMs. MSMs with 100 states have a similar performance as the deep MSMs but
this comes at the cost of a model with a much larger latent space.

Finally, we test DeepGenMSMs for Alanine dipeptide where χ is trained with the ML method and
the generator is then trained using ED (ML-ED). The stationary distribution generated by simulat-
ing the DeepGenMSM recursively results in a stationary distribution which is very similar to the
reference distribution in states 1-4 with small φ values (Fig. 4a). States number 5 and 6 with large
φ values are captured, but their shapes and weights are somewhat distorted (Fig. 4a). The one-step
transition densities predicted by the generator are high quality for all states (Suppl. Fig. 2), thus
the differences observed for the stationary distribution must come from small errors made in the
transitions between metastable states that are very rarely observed for states 5 and 6. These rare
events result in poor training data for the generator. However, the DeepGenMSMs approximates the
kinetics well within the uncertainty that is mostly due to estimator variance (Fig. 4c).

Now we ask whether DeepGenMSMs can sample valid structures in the 30-dimensional conﬁgura-
tion space, i.e., if the placement of atoms is physically meaningful. As we generate conﬁgurations
in Cartesian space, we ﬁrst check if the internal coordinates are physically viable by comparing
all bond lengths and angles between real MD data and generated trajectories (Fig. 5). The true
bond lengths and angles are almost perfectly Gaussian distributed, and we thus normalize them by
shifting each distribution to a mean of 0 and scaling it to have standard deviation 1, which results
all reference distributions to collapse to a normal distribution (Fig. 5a,c). We normalize the gener-
ated distribution with the mean and standard distribution of the true data. Although there are clear
differences (Fig. 5b,d), these distributions are very encouraging. Bonds and angles are very stiff de-
grees of freedom, and the fact that most differences in mean and standard deviation are small when
compared to the true ﬂuctuation width means that the generated structures are close to physically
accurate and could be reﬁned by little additional MD simulation effort.

Finally, we perform an experiment to test whether the DeepGenMSM is able to generate genuinely
new conﬁgurations that do exist for Alanine dipeptide but have not been seen in the training data. In
other words, can the generator “extrapolate” in a meaningful way? This is a fundamental question,
because simulating MD is exorbitantly expensive, with each simulation time step being computation-
ally expensive but progressing time only of the order of 10−15 seconds, while often total simulation

timescales of 10−3 seconds or longer are needed. A DeepGenMSM that makes leaps of length τ
– orders of magnitude larger than the MD simulation time-step – and has even a small chance of
generating new and meaningful structures would be extremely valuable to discover new states and
thereby accelerate MD sampling.

To test this ability, we conduct six experiments, in each of which we remove all data belonging to one
of the six metastable states of Alanine dipeptide (6a). We train a DeepGenMSM with each of these
datasets separately, and simulate it to predict the stationary distribution (6b). While the generated
stationary distributions are skewed and the shape of the distribution in the (φ, ψ) range with missing-
data are not quantitatively predicted, the DeepGenMSMs do indeed predict conﬁgurations where no
training data was present (6b). Surprisingly, the quality of most of these conﬁgurations is high (6c).
While the structures of the two low-populated states 5-6 do not look realistic, each of the metastable
states 1-4 are generated with high quality, as shown by the overlap of a real MD structure and the
100 most similar generated structures (6c).

In conclusion, deep MSMs provide high-quality models of the stationary and kinetic properties for
stochastic dynamical systems such as MD simulations.
In contrast to other high-quality models
such as VAMPnets, the resulting model is truly probabilistic and can thus be physically interpreted
and be used in a Bayesian framework. For the ﬁrst time, it was shown that generating dynamical
trajectories in a 30-dimensional molecular conﬁguration space results in sampling of physically
realistic molecular structures. While Alanine dipeptide is a small system compared to proteins and
other macromolecules that are of biological interest, our results demonstrate that efﬁcient sampling
of new molecular structures is possible with generative dynamic models, and improved methods
can be built upon this. Future methods will especially need to address the difﬁculties of generating
valid conﬁgurations in low-probability regimes, and it is likely that the energy distance used here
for generator training needs to be revisited to achieve this goal.

Analysis of transition matrices

The transition matrix K(τ ) = [kij(τ )] ∈ Rm×m is deﬁned as

kij(τ ) = P(xt+τ ∈ state j|xt ∈ state i).

Then, according to (1), we have

kij(τ ) =

P(xt+τ = y|xt ∈ state i) · P(xt+τ ∈ state j|xt+τ = y)dy

(cid:90)

(cid:90)

=

qi(y; τ )χj(y) dy,

and

If χ, q satisfy the conditions

kij(nτ ) = [K(τ )n]ij .

χi(x) ≥ 0, (cid:80)
j χj(x) = 1,
qi(x; τ ) ≥ 0, (cid:82) qi(y; τ )dy = 1, ∀x, i,
j kij(τ ) = 1, i.e., K(τ ) computed from χ, q is a valid transition

we have kij(τ ) ≥ 0 and (cid:80)
probability matrix.

For the distribution µ deﬁned in (4),

(cid:90)

(cid:90)

P(xt+τ = y|xt = x) · µ(x)dx =

q(y; τ )(cid:62)χ(x) · q(x; τ )(cid:62)πdx

= q(y; τ )(cid:62)π
= µ(y),

which shows µ is the stationary distribution of model (1).

VAMP-E training of deep MSMs

An alternative to ML training is to employ a score from the Variational Approach of Markov Pro-
cesses (VAMP) [31]. The VAMP-E score has the advantage over other VAMP scores employed
previously [15] that we do not have to specify the rank of the model [31]. The VAMP-E score is
computed as

RE = tr

(cid:16)

2C01 ¯Γ−1 − C00 ¯Γ−1C11 ¯Γ−1(cid:17)

(14)

which depends on covariance matrices estimated from the transformed data:

[C00]ij = Et[χi(xt)χj(xt)]
[C11]ij = Et[γi(xt+τ )γj(xt+τ )]
[C01]ij = Et[χi(xt)γj(xt+τ )]
¯Γ = diag(¯γ1, . . . , ¯γm).
We can use the standard empirical estimators to compute Et. We can then train a deep MSM using
the structure shown in Fig. 1 by maximizing (14).

Using the Energy Distance to train generative networks

The Energy Distance (ED) [28] is a metric that measures the difference between the distributions of
two real valued random vectors x and y, and is deﬁned as

DE(P(x), P(y)) = E [2 (cid:107)x − y(cid:107) − (cid:107)x − x(cid:48)(cid:107) − (cid:107)y − y(cid:48)(cid:107)] .
(15)
Here, x(cid:48), y(cid:48) are independently distributed according to the distributions of y, z. Therefore, the con-
ditional energy distance given in (12) is equal to the mean value of the energy distance between the

11

conditional distributions P(xt+τ |xt) and P(ˆxt+τ |xt) for all xt, and satisﬁes that D ≥ 0 and D = 0
if and only if P(xt+τ |xt) = P(ˆxt+τ |xt) for all xt.
Noticing that E (cid:2)(cid:13)

Motivation of Energy Distance as the training metric

The major advantages of ED are:

1. It can be unbiasedly estimated from the data without an extra “adversarial” network as in

GANs.

2. Unlike the KL divergence (see example 1 in [1]), ED does not diverge in the case of few

data points (small batch sizes) or low populated probability density areas.

3. As a speciﬁc Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD), ED can avoid the problem of popular
kernel-MMDs that the gradients of cost functions are vanished if the generated samples
are far away from the training data, and therefore achieve higher efﬁciency when learning
generative models.

Network architecture and training procedure

All neural networks representing the functions χ, γ and G for the Prinz potential are using 64
nodes in all 4 hidden layers and batch normalization after each layer [9]. Rectiﬁed linear activation
functions (ReLUs) are used, except for the output layer of χ which uses SoftMax and the output
layer of G which has a linear activation function. Both χ and γ have 4 output nodes, and G receives
a four-dimensional 1-hot-encoding of the metastable state plus a four-dimensional noise vector as
inputs. Optimization is done using Adam [10], with early stopping checking if the validation score
is not increasing over 5 epochs. The learning rate for the training of χ, γ is λ = 10−3, and for G
λ = 10−5 with a batchsize of 100. We are using a time-lag of τ = 5 frames.

For alanine dipeptide, χ and γ consist both of 3 residual blocks [7] built of 3 layers all having 100
nodes, with exponential linear units (ELUs) [5], and batch normalization for each layer. The output
layer has 6 output nodes, where χ uses a softmax activation function and γ a RELU, respectively.
In order to ﬁnd all slow processes, it was necessary to pre-train χ with the VAMPnet method [15].
The generator G uses 6 noise inputs and a six-dimensional 1-hot-encoding of the metastable state
and the ML-ED scheme. Networks are trained with Adam until the validation score converges with
a learning rate of λ = 10−5 for χ, γ using 8000 as batchsize and λ = 10−4 for G using 1500 frames
for a batch. All subsequent analyses that use a ﬁxed lag time employ τ = 1 ps.

For ﬁnding the hyperparameter we performed a restricted grid search, which showed comparing the
KL divergence between the modeled distributions that the result does only marginally depend on the
choice of the parameters (see 1 for an example).

Abstract

We propose a deep generative Markov State Model (DeepGenMSM) learning
framework for inference of metastable dynamical systems and prediction of tra-
jectories. After unsupervised training on time series data, the model contains (i)
a probabilistic encoder that maps from high-dimensional conﬁguration space to a
small-sized vector indicating the membership to metastable (long-lived) states, (ii)
a Markov chain that governs the transitions between metastable states and facili-
tates analysis of the long-time dynamics, and (iii) a generative part that samples
the conditional distribution of conﬁgurations in the next time step. The model
can be operated in a recursive fashion to generate trajectories to predict the sys-
tem evolution from a deﬁned starting state and propose new conﬁgurations. The
DeepGenMSM is demonstrated to provide accurate estimates of the long-time ki-
netics and generate valid distributions for molecular dynamics (MD) benchmark
systems. Remarkably, we show that DeepGenMSMs are able to make long time-
steps in molecular conﬁguration space and generate physically realistic structures
in regions that were not seen in training data.

Introduction

Complex dynamical systems that exhibit events on vastly different timescales are ubiquitous in sci-
ence and engineering. For example, molecular dynamics (MD) of biomolecules involve fast vibra-
tions on the timescales of 10−15 seconds, while their biological function is often related to the rare
switching events between long-lived states on timescales of 10−3 seconds or longer. In weather and
climate systems, local ﬂuctuations in temperature and pressure ﬁelds occur within minutes or hours,
while global changes are often subject to periodic motion and drift over years or decades. Primary
goals in the analysis of complex dynamical systems include:

1. Deriving an interpretable model of the essential long-time dynamical properties of these

systems, such as the stationary behavior or lifetimes/cycle times of slow processes.

2. Simulating the dynamical system, e.g., to predict the system’s future evolution or to sample

previously unobserved system conﬁgurations.

A state-of-the-art approach for the ﬁrst goal is to learn a Markovian model from time-series data,
which is theoretically justiﬁed by the fact that physical systems are inherently Markovian. In prac-
tice, the long-time behavior of dynamical systems can be accurately described in a Markovian model
when suitable features or variables are used, and when the time resolution of the model is sufﬁciently
coarse such that the time-evolution can be represented with a manageable number of dynamical
modes [25, 11]. In stochastic dynamical systems, such as MD simulation, variants of Markov state
models (MSMs) are commonly used [3, 24, 22]. In MSMs, the conﬁguration space is discretized,
e.g., using a clustering method, and the dynamics between clusters are then described by a matrix

of transition probabilities [22]. The analogous approach for deterministic dynamical systems such
as complex ﬂuid ﬂows is called Koopman analysis, where time propagation is approximated by a
linear model in a suitable function space transformation of the ﬂow variables [16, 26, 29, 4]. The
recently proposed VAMPnets learn an optimal feature transformation from full conﬁguration space
to a low-dimensional latent space in which the Markovian model is built by variational optimization
of a neural network [15]. When the VAMPnet has a probabilistic output (e.g. SoftMax layer), the
Markovian model conserves probability, but is not guaranteed to be a valid transition probability
matrix with nonnegative elements. A related work for deterministic dynamical systems is Extended
Dynamic Mode Decomposition with dictionary learning [13]. All of these methods are purely ana-
lytic, i.e. they learn a reduced model of the dynamical system underlying the observed time series,
but they miss a generative part that could be used to sample new time series in the high-dimensional
conﬁguration space.

Recently, several learning frameworks for dynamical systems have been proposed that partially ad-
dress the second goal by including a decoder from the latent space back to the space of input features.
Most of these methods primarily aim at obtaining a low-dimensional latent space that encodes the
long-time behavior of the system, and the decoder takes the role of deﬁning or regularizing the learn-
ing problem [30, 8, 14, 19, 23]. In particular none of these models have demonstrated the ability to
generate viable structures in the high-dimensional conﬁguration space, such as a molecular struc-
ture with realistic atom positions in 3D. Finally, some of these models learn a linear model of the
long-timescale dynamics [14, 19], but none of them provide a probabilistic dynamical model that
can be employed in a Bayesian framework. Learning the correct long-time dynamical behavior with
a generative dynamical model is difﬁcult, as demonstrated in [8].

Here, we address these aforementioned gaps by providing a deep learning framework that learns,
based on time-series data, the following components:

1. Probabilistic encodings of the input conﬁguration to a low-dimensional latent space by

neural networks, xt → χ(xt).

2. A true transition probability matrix K describing the system dynamics in latent space for a

ﬁxed time-lag τ :

E [χ(xt+τ )] = E (cid:2)K(cid:62)(τ )χ(xt)(cid:3) .
The probabilistic nature of the method allows us to train it with likelihood maximization
and embed it into a Bayesian framework. In our benchmarks, the transition probability
matrix approximates the long-time behavior of the underlying dynamical system with high
accuracy.

3. A generative model from latent vectors back to conﬁgurations, allowing us to sample the
transition density P(xt+τ |xt) and thus propagate the model in conﬁguration space. We
show for the ﬁrst time that this allows us to sample genuinely new and valid molecular
structures that have not been included in the training data. This makes the method promis-
ing for performing active learning in MD [2, 21], and to predict the future evolution of the
system in other contexts.

2 Deep Generative Markov State Models

Given two conﬁgurations x, y ∈ Rd, where Rd is a potentially high-dimensional space of system
conﬁgurations (e.g. the positions of atoms in a molecular system), Markovian dynamics are deﬁned
by the transition density P(xt+τ = y|xt = x). Here we represent the transition density between m
states in the following form (Fig. 1):

P(xt+τ = y|xt = x) = χ(x)(cid:62)q(y; τ ) =

χi(x)qi(y; τ ).

(1)

m
(cid:88)

i=1

Here, χ(x)(cid:62) = [χ1(x), ..., χm(x)] represent the probability of conﬁguration x to be in a metastable
(long-lived) state i

Consequently, these functions are nonnegative (χi(x) ≥ 0∀x) and sum up to one ((cid:80)
i χi(x) = 1∀x).
The functions χ(x) can, e.g., be represented by a neural network mapping from Rd to Rm with a

χi(x) = P(xt ∈ state i | xt = x).

Figure 1: Schematic of Deep Generative Markov State Models (DeepGenMSMs) and the rewiring
trick. The function χ, here represented by neural networks, maps the time-lagged input conﬁgura-
tions to metastable states whose dynamics are governed by a transition probability matrix K. The
generator samples the distribution xt+τ ∼ q by employing a generative network that can produce
novel conﬁgurations (or by resampling xt+τ in DeepResampleMSMs). The rewiring trick consists
of reconnecting the probabilistic networks q and χ such that the time propagation in latent space
can be sampled: From the latent state χ(xt), we generate a time-lagged conﬁguration xt+τ using
q, and then transform it back to the latent space, χ(xt+τ ). Each application of the rewired net-
work samples the latent space transitions, thus providing the statistics to estimate the Markov model
transition matrix K(τ ), which is needed for analysis. This trick allows K(τ ) to be estimated with
desired constraints, such as detailed balance.

SoftMax output layer. Additionally, we have the probability densities
qi(y; τ ) = P(xt+τ = y|xt ∈ state i)
that deﬁne the probability density of the system to “land” at conﬁguration y after making one time-
step. We thus brieﬂy call them “landing densities”.

2.1 Kinetics

Before addressing how to estimate χ and q from data, we describe how to perform the standard
calculations and analyses that are common in the Markov modeling ﬁeld for a model of the form
(1).

In Markov modeling, one is typically interested in the kinetics of the system, i.e.
the long-time
behavior of the dynamics. This is captured by the elements of the transition matrix K = [kij]
between metastable states. K can be computed as follows: the product of the probability density
to jump from metastable i to a conﬁguration y and the probability that this conﬁguration belongs to
metastable state j, integrated over the whole conﬁguration space.

kij(τ ) =

qi(y; τ )χj(y) dy.

(2)

(cid:90)

y

Practically, this calculation is implemented via the “rewiring trick” shown in Fig. 1, where the
conﬁguration space integral is approximated by drawing samples from the generator. The estimated
probabilistic functions q and χ deﬁne, by construction, a valid transition probability matrix K,
i.e. kij ≥ 0 and (cid:80)
j kij = 1. As a result, the proposed models have a structural advantage over
other high-accuracy Markov state modeling approaches that deﬁne metastable states in a fuzzy or
probabilistic manner but do not guarantee a valid transition matrix [12, 15] (See Supplementary
Material for more details.).

The stationary (equilibrium) probabilities of the metastable states are given by the vector π = [πi]
that solves the eigenvalue problem with eigenvalue λ1 = 1:

and the stationary (equilibrium) distribution in conﬁguration space is given by:

π = K(cid:62)π,

µ(y) =

πiqi(y; τ ) = π(cid:62)q(y; τ ).

(cid:88)

i

Finally, for a ﬁxed deﬁnition of states via χ, the self-consistency of Markov models may be tested
using the Chapman-Kolmogorov equation

(3)

(5)

Kn(τ ) ≈ K(nτ )

which involves estimating the functions q(y; nτ ) at different lag times nτ and comparing the re-
sulting transition matrices with the nth power of the transition matrix obtained at lag time τ . A
consequence of Eq. (5) is that the relaxation times

ti(τ ) = −

τ
log |λi(τ )|

are independent of the lag time τ at which K is estimated [27]. Here, λi with i = 2, ..., m are the
nontrivial eigenvalues of K.

2.2 Maximum Likelihood (ML) learning of DeepResampleMSM

Given trajectories {xt}t=1,...,T , how do we estimate the membership probabilities χ(x), and how
do we learn and sample the landing densities q(y)? We start with a model, where q(y) are di-
rectly derived from the observed (empirical) observations, i.e. they are point densities on the input
conﬁgurations {xt}, given by:

1
¯γi
Here, ρ(y) is the empirical distribution, which in the case of ﬁnite sample size is simply ρ(y) =
t=1 δ(y − xt+τ ), and γi(y) is a trainable weighting function. The normalization factor

γi(y)ρ(y).

qi(y) =

(cid:80)T −τ

(cid:80)T −τ

t=1 γi(xt+τ ) = Ey∼ρ1[γi(y)] ensures (cid:82)

¯γi = 1
T −τ

Now we can optimize χi and γi by maximizing the likelihood (ML) of generating the pairs
(xt, xt+τ ) observed in the data. The log-likelihood is given by:

and is maximized to train a deep MSM with the structure shown in Fig. 1.

i=1

Alternatively, we can optimize χi and γi using the Variational Approach for Markov Processes
(VAMP) [31]. However, we found the ML approach to perform signiﬁcantly better in our tests, and
we thus include the VAMP training approach only in the Supplementary Material without elaborat-
ing on it further.

Given the networks χ and γ, we compute q from Eq. (7). Employing the rewiring trick shown in
Fig. 1 results in computing the transition matrix by a simple average over all conﬁgurations:

The deep MSMs described in this section are neural network generalizations of traditional MSMs
– they learn a mapping from conﬁgurations to metastable states, where they aim obtaining a good
approximation of the kinetics of the underlying dynamical system, by means of the transition matrix
K. However, since the landing distribution q in these methods is derived from the empirical distribu-
tion (7), any generated trajectory will only resample conﬁgurations from the input data. To highlight
this property, we will refer to the deep MSMs with the present methodology as DeepResampleMSM.

2.3 Energy Distance learning of DeepGenMSM

In contrast to DeepResampleMSM, we now want to learn deep generative MSM (DeepGenMSM),
which can be used to generate trajectories that do not only resample from input data, but can produce
genuinely new conﬁgurations. To this end, we train a generative model to mimic the empirical
distribution qi(y):

y = G(ei, (cid:15)),
(10)
where the vector ei ∈ Rm is a one-hot encoding of the metastable state, and (cid:15) is a i.i.d. random
vector where each component samples from a Gaussian normal distribution.

Here we train the generator G by minimizing the conditional Energy Distance (ED), whose choice is
motivated in the Supplementary Material. The standard ED, introduced in [28], is a metric between
the distributions of random vectors, deﬁned as

DE (P(x), P(y)) = E [2 (cid:107)x − y(cid:107) − (cid:107)x − x(cid:48)(cid:107) − (cid:107)y − y(cid:48)(cid:107)]

(11)

for two real-valued random variables x and y. x, x(cid:48), y, y(cid:48) are independently distributed according to
the distributions of x, y. Based on this metric, we introduce the conditional energy distance between
the transition density of the system and that of the generative model:

D (cid:44) E [DE (P(xt+τ |xt), P(ˆxt+τ |xt)) |xt]

= E (cid:2)2 (cid:107)ˆxt+τ − xt+τ (cid:107) − (cid:13)

(cid:13)ˆxt+τ − ˆx(cid:48)

t+τ

(cid:13)

(cid:13)xt+τ − x(cid:48)

t+τ

(cid:13)
(cid:3)
(cid:13)

(12)

t+τ are distributed according to the transition density for given xt and ˆxt+τ , ˆx(cid:48)

Here xt+τ and x(cid:48)
t+τ
are independent outputs of the generative model conditioned on xt. Implementing the expectation
value with an empirical average results in an estimate for D that is unbiased, up to an additive
constant. We train G to minimize D. See Supplementary Material for detailed derivations and the
training algorithm used.

After training, the transition matrix can be obtained by using the rewiring trick (Fig. 1), where the
conﬁguration space integral is sampled by generating samples from the generator:

[K]ij = E(cid:15) [χj (G(ei, (cid:15)))] .

(13)

3 Results

Below we establish our framework by applying it to two well-deﬁned benchmark systems that ex-
hibit metastable stochastic dynamics. We validate the stationary distribution and kinetics by comput-
ing χ(x), q(y), the stationary distribution µ(y) and the relaxation times ti(τ ) and comparing them
with reference solutions. We will also test the abilities of DeepGenMSMs to generate physically
valid molecular conﬁgurations.

The networks were implemented using PyTorch [20] and Tensorﬂow [6]. For the full code and all
details about the neural network architecture, hyper-parameters and training algorithm, please refer

3.1 Diffusion in Prinz potential

We ﬁrst apply our framework to the time-discretized diffusion process xt+∆t = −∆t ∇V (xt) +
√
2∆t ˙ηt with ∆t = 0.01 in the Prinz potential V (xt) introduced in [22] (Fig. 2a). For this system
we know exact results for benchmarking: the stationary distribution and relaxation timescales (black
lines in Fig. 2b,c) and the transition density (Fig. 2d). We simulate trajectories of lengths 250, 000
and 125, 000 time steps for training and validation, respectively. For all methods, we repeat the data
generation and model estimation process 10 times and compute mean and standard deviations for
all quantities of interest, which thus represent the mean and variance of the estimators.

The functions χ, γ and G are represented with densely connected neural networks. The details of
the architecture and the training procedure can be found in the Supplementary Information.

We compare DeepResampleMSMs and DeepGenMSMs with standard MSMs using four or ten
states obtained with k-means clustering. Note that standard MSMs do not directly operate on con-
ﬁguration space. When using an MSM, the transition density (Eq. 1) is thus simulated by:

∼Ki,∗−→ j
i.e., we ﬁnd the cluster i associated with a conﬁguration xt, which is deterministic for regular MSMs,
then sample the cluster j at the next time-step, and sample from the conditional distribution of
conﬁgurations in cluster j to generate xt+τ .

∼ρj (y)
−→ xt+τ ,

χ(xt)
−→ i

xt

Both DeepResampleMSMs trained with the ML method and standard MSMs can reproduce the
stationary distribution within statistical uncertainty (Fig. 2b). For long lag times τ , all methods con-
verge from below to the correct relaxation timescales (Fig. 2c), as expected from theory [22, 18].
When using equally many states (here: four), the DeepResampleMSM has a much lower bias in the
relaxation timescales than the standard MSM. This is expected from approximation theory, as the
DeepResampleMSMs represents the four metastable states with a meaningful, smooth membership
functions χ(xt), while the four-state MSM cuts the memberships hard at boundaries with low sam-
ple density (Supplementary Fig. 1). When increasing the number of metastable states, the bias of
all estimators will reduce. An MSM with ten states is needed to perform approximately equal to a
four-state DeepResampleMSM (Fig. 2c). All subsequent analyses use a lag time of τ = 5.

ML-ED training. (a) Stationary distribution. (b-d) Transition densities. (e) Relaxation timescales.

The DeepResampleMSM generates a transition density that is very similar to the exact density,
while the MSM transition densities are coarse-grained by virtue of the fact that χ(xt) performs a
hard clustering in an MSM (Fig. 2d). This impression is conﬁrmed when computing the Kullback-
Leibler divergence of the distributions (Fig. 2e).

Encouraged by the accurate results of DeepResampleMSMs, we now train DeepGenMSM, either
by training both the χ and q networks by minimizing the energy distance (ED), or by taking χ
from a ML-trained DeepResampleMSM and only training the q network by minimizing the energy
distance (ML-ED). The stationary densities, relaxation timescales and transition densities can still
be approximated in these settings, although the DeepGenMSMs exhibit larger statistical ﬂuctuations
than the resampling MSMs (Fig. 3). ML-ED appears to perform slightly better than ED alone, likely
because reusing χ from the ML training makes the problem of training the generator easier.

For a one-dimensional example like the Prinz potential, learning a generative model does not provide
any added value, as the distributions can be well approximated by the empirical distributions. The
fact that we can still get approximately correct results for stationary, kinetics and dynamical proper-
ties encourages us to use DeepGenMSMs for a higher-dimensional example, where the generation
of conﬁgurations is a hard problem.

3.2 Alanine dipeptide

We use explicit-solvent MD simulations of Alanine dipeptide as a second example. Our aim is
the learn stationary and kinetic properties, but especially to learn a generative model that generates
genuinely novel but physically meaningful conﬁgurations. One 250 ns trajectory with a storage
interval of 1 ps is used and split 80%/20% for training and validation – see [15] for details of the
simulation setup. We characterize all structures by the three-dimensional Cartesian coordinates of
the heavy atoms, resulting in a 30 dimensional conﬁguration space. While we do not have exact
results for Alanine dipeptide, the system is small enough and well enough sampled, such that high-

quality estimates of stationary and kinetic properties can be obtained from a very ﬁne MSM [22].
We therefore deﬁne an MSM build on 400 equally sized grid areas in the (φ, ψ)-plane as a reference
at a lag time of τ = 25 ps that has been validated by established methods [22].

Neural network and training details are again found at the git repository and in the Supplementary
Information.

For comparison with deep MSMs, we build two standard MSMs following a state of the art protocol:
we transform input conﬁgurations with a kinetic map preserving 95% of the cumulative kinetic
variance [17], followed by k-means clustering, where k = 6 and k = 100 are used.

DeepResampleMSM trained with ML method approximate the stationary distribution very well (Fig.
4a). The reference MSM assigns a slightly lower weight to the lowest-populated state 6, but other-
wise the data, reference distribution and deep MSM distribution are visually indistinguishable. The
relaxation timescales estimated by a six-state DeepResampleMSM are signiﬁcantly better than with
six-state standard MSMs. MSMs with 100 states have a similar performance as the deep MSMs but
this comes at the cost of a model with a much larger latent space.

Finally, we test DeepGenMSMs for Alanine dipeptide where χ is trained with the ML method and
the generator is then trained using ED (ML-ED). The stationary distribution generated by simulat-
ing the DeepGenMSM recursively results in a stationary distribution which is very similar to the
reference distribution in states 1-4 with small φ values (Fig. 4a). States number 5 and 6 with large
φ values are captured, but their shapes and weights are somewhat distorted (Fig. 4a). The one-step
transition densities predicted by the generator are high quality for all states (Suppl. Fig. 2), thus
the differences observed for the stationary distribution must come from small errors made in the
transitions between metastable states that are very rarely observed for states 5 and 6. These rare
events result in poor training data for the generator. However, the DeepGenMSMs approximates the
kinetics well within the uncertainty that is mostly due to estimator variance (Fig. 4c).

Now we ask whether DeepGenMSMs can sample valid structures in the 30-dimensional conﬁgura-
tion space, i.e., if the placement of atoms is physically meaningful. As we generate conﬁgurations
in Cartesian space, we ﬁrst check if the internal coordinates are physically viable by comparing
all bond lengths and angles between real MD data and generated trajectories (Fig. 5). The true
bond lengths and angles are almost perfectly Gaussian distributed, and we thus normalize them by
shifting each distribution to a mean of 0 and scaling it to have standard deviation 1, which results
all reference distributions to collapse to a normal distribution (Fig. 5a,c). We normalize the gener-
ated distribution with the mean and standard distribution of the true data. Although there are clear
differences (Fig. 5b,d), these distributions are very encouraging. Bonds and angles are very stiff de-
grees of freedom, and the fact that most differences in mean and standard deviation are small when
compared to the true ﬂuctuation width means that the generated structures are close to physically
accurate and could be reﬁned by little additional MD simulation effort.

Finally, we perform an experiment to test whether the DeepGenMSM is able to generate genuinely
new conﬁgurations that do exist for Alanine dipeptide but have not been seen in the training data. In
other words, can the generator “extrapolate” in a meaningful way? This is a fundamental question,
because simulating MD is exorbitantly expensive, with each simulation time step being computation-
ally expensive but progressing time only of the order of 10−15 seconds, while often total simulation

timescales of 10−3 seconds or longer are needed. A DeepGenMSM that makes leaps of length τ
– orders of magnitude larger than the MD simulation time-step – and has even a small chance of
generating new and meaningful structures would be extremely valuable to discover new states and
thereby accelerate MD sampling.

To test this ability, we conduct six experiments, in each of which we remove all data belonging to one
of the six metastable states of Alanine dipeptide (6a). We train a DeepGenMSM with each of these
datasets separately, and simulate it to predict the stationary distribution (6b). While the generated
stationary distributions are skewed and the shape of the distribution in the (φ, ψ) range with missing-
data are not quantitatively predicted, the DeepGenMSMs do indeed predict conﬁgurations where no
training data was present (6b). Surprisingly, the quality of most of these conﬁgurations is high (6c).
While the structures of the two low-populated states 5-6 do not look realistic, each of the metastable
states 1-4 are generated with high quality, as shown by the overlap of a real MD structure and the
100 most similar generated structures (6c).

In conclusion, deep MSMs provide high-quality models of the stationary and kinetic properties for
stochastic dynamical systems such as MD simulations.
In contrast to other high-quality models
such as VAMPnets, the resulting model is truly probabilistic and can thus be physically interpreted
and be used in a Bayesian framework. For the ﬁrst time, it was shown that generating dynamical
trajectories in a 30-dimensional molecular conﬁguration space results in sampling of physically
realistic molecular structures. While Alanine dipeptide is a small system compared to proteins and
other macromolecules that are of biological interest, our results demonstrate that efﬁcient sampling
of new molecular structures is possible with generative dynamic models, and improved methods
can be built upon this. Future methods will especially need to address the difﬁculties of generating
valid conﬁgurations in low-probability regimes, and it is likely that the energy distance used here
for generator training needs to be revisited to achieve this goal.

Analysis of transition matrices

The transition matrix K(τ ) = [kij(τ )] ∈ Rm×m is deﬁned as

kij(τ ) = P(xt+τ ∈ state j|xt ∈ state i).

Then, according to (1), we have

kij(τ ) =

P(xt+τ = y|xt ∈ state i) · P(xt+τ ∈ state j|xt+τ = y)dy

(cid:90)

(cid:90)

=

qi(y; τ )χj(y) dy,

and

If χ, q satisfy the conditions

kij(nτ ) = [K(τ )n]ij .

χi(x) ≥ 0, (cid:80)
j χj(x) = 1,
qi(x; τ ) ≥ 0, (cid:82) qi(y; τ )dy = 1, ∀x, i,
j kij(τ ) = 1, i.e., K(τ ) computed from χ, q is a valid transition

we have kij(τ ) ≥ 0 and (cid:80)

(cid:90)

= µ(y),

which shows µ is the stationary distribution of model (1).

VAMP-E training of deep MSMs

An alternative to ML training is to employ a score from the Variational Approach of Markov Pro-
cesses (VAMP) [31]. The VAMP-E score has the advantage over other VAMP scores employed
previously [15] that we do not have to specify the rank of the model [31]. The VAMP-E score is
computed as

RE = tr

(cid:16)

2C01 ¯Γ−1 − C00 ¯Γ−1C11 ¯Γ−1(cid:17)

(14)

which depends on covariance matrices estimated from the transformed data:

[C00]ij = Et[χi(xt)χj(xt)]
[C11]ij = Et[γi(xt+τ )γj(xt+τ )]
[C01]ij = Et[χi(xt)γj(xt+τ )]
¯Γ = diag(¯γ1, . . . , ¯γm).
We can use the standard empirical estimators to compute Et. We can then train a deep MSM using
the structure shown in Fig. 1 by maximizing (14).

Using the Energy Distance to train generative networks

The Energy Distance (ED) [28] is a metric that measures the difference between the distributions of
two real valued random vectors x and y, and is deﬁned as

DE(P(x), P(y)) = E [2 (cid:107)x − y(cid:107) − (cid:107)x − x(cid:48)(cid:107) − (cid:107)y − y(cid:48)(cid:107)] .
(15)
Here, x(cid:48), y(cid:48) are independently distributed according to the distributions of y, z. Therefore, the con-
ditional energy distance given in (12) is equal to the mean value of the energy distance between the

conditional distributions P(xt+τ |xt) and P(ˆxt+τ |xt) for all xt, and satisﬁes that D ≥ 0 and D = 0
if and only if P(xt+τ |xt) = P(ˆxt+τ |xt) for all xt.

Motivation of Energy Distance as the training metric

The major advantages of ED are:

1. It can be unbiasedly estimated from the data without an extra “adversarial” network as in

GANs.

2. Unlike the KL divergence (see example 1 in [1]), ED does not diverge in the case of few

data points (small batch sizes) or low populated probability density areas.

3. As a speciﬁc Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD), ED can avoid the problem of popular
kernel-MMDs that the gradients of cost functions are vanished if the generated samples
are far away from the training data, and therefore achieve higher efﬁciency when learning
generative models.

Network architecture and training procedure

All neural networks representing the functions χ, γ and G for the Prinz potential are using 64
nodes in all 4 hidden layers and batch normalization after each layer [9]. Rectiﬁed linear activation
functions (ReLUs) are used, except for the output layer of χ which uses SoftMax and the output
layer of G which has a linear activation function. Both χ and γ have 4 output nodes, and G receives
a four-dimensional 1-hot-encoding of the metastable state plus a four-dimensional noise vector as
inputs. Optimization is done using Adam [10], with early stopping checking if the validation score
is not increasing over 5 epochs. The learning rate for the training of χ, γ is λ = 10−3, and for G
λ = 10−5 with a batchsize of 100. We are using a time-lag of τ = 5 frames.

For alanine dipeptide, χ and γ consist both of 3 residual blocks [7] built of 3 layers all having 100
nodes, with exponential linear units (ELUs) [5], and batch normalization for each layer. The output
layer has 6 output nodes, where χ uses a softmax activation function and γ a RELU, respectively.
In order to ﬁnd all slow processes, it was necessary to pre-train χ with the VAMPnet method [15].
The generator G uses 6 noise inputs and a six-dimensional 1-hot-encoding of the metastable state
and the ML-ED scheme. Networks are trained with Adam until the validation score converges with
a learning rate of λ = 10−5 for χ, γ using 8000 as batchsize and λ = 10−4 for G using 1500 frames
for a batch. All subsequent analyses that use a ﬁxed lag time employ τ = 1 ps.

For ﬁnding the hyperparameter we performed a restricted grid search, which showed comparing the
KL divergence between the modeled distributions that the result does only marginally depend on the
choice of the parameters (see 1 for an example).

Abstract

We propose a deep generative Markov State Model (DeepGenMSM) learning
framework for inference of metastable dynamical systems and prediction of tra-
jectories. After unsupervised training on time series data, the model contains (i)
a probabilistic encoder that maps from high-dimensional conﬁguration space to a
small-sized vector indicating the membership to metastable (long-lived) states, (ii)
a Markov chain that governs the transitions between metastable states and facili-
tates analysis of the long-time dynamics, and (iii) a generative part that samples
the conditional distribution of conﬁgurations in the next time step. The model
can be operated in a recursive fashion to generate trajectories to predict the sys-
tem evolution from a deﬁned starting state and propose new conﬁgurations. The
DeepGenMSM is demonstrated to provide accurate estimates of the long-time ki-
netics and generate valid distributions for molecular dynamics (MD) benchmark
systems. Remarkably, we show that DeepGenMSMs are able to make long time-
steps in molecular conﬁguration space and generate physically realistic structures
in regions that were not seen in training data.

Introduction

Complex dynamical systems that exhibit events on vastly different timescales are ubiquitous in sci-
ence and engineering. For example, molecular dynamics (MD) of biomolecules involve fast vibra-
tions on the timescales of 10−15 seconds, while their biological function is often related to the rare
switching events between long-lived states on timescales of 10−3 seconds or longer. In weather and
climate systems, local ﬂuctuations in temperature and pressure ﬁelds occur within minutes or hours,
while global changes are often subject to periodic motion and drift over years or decades. Primary
goals in the analysis of complex dynamical systems include:

1. Deriving an interpretable model of the essential long-time dynamical properties of these

systems, such as the stationary behavior or lifetimes/cycle times of slow processes.

2. Simulating the dynamical system, e.g., to predict the system’s future evolution or to sample

previously unobserved system conﬁgurations.

A state-of-the-art approach for the ﬁrst goal is to learn a Markovian model from time-series data,
which is theoretically justiﬁed by the fact that physical systems are inherently Markovian. In prac-
tice, the long-time behavior of dynamical systems can be accurately described in a Markovian model
when suitable features or variables are used, and when the time resolution of the model is sufﬁciently
coarse such that the time-evolution can be represented with a manageable number of dynamical
modes [25, 11]. In stochastic dynamical systems, such as MD simulation, variants of Markov state
models (MSMs) are commonly used [3, 24, 22]. In MSMs, the conﬁguration space is discretized,
e.g., using a clustering method, and the dynamics between clusters are then described by a matrix

of transition probabilities [22]. The analogous approach for deterministic dynamical systems such
as complex ﬂuid ﬂows is called Koopman analysis, where time propagation is approximated by a
linear model in a suitable function space transformation of the ﬂow variables [16, 26, 29, 4]. The
recently proposed VAMPnets learn an optimal feature transformation from full conﬁguration space
to a low-dimensional latent space in which the Markovian model is built by variational optimization
of a neural network [15]. When the VAMPnet has a probabilistic output (e.g. SoftMax layer), the
Markovian model conserves probability, but is not guaranteed to be a valid transition probability
matrix with nonnegative elements. A related work for deterministic dynamical systems is Extended
Dynamic Mode Decomposition with dictionary learning [13]. All of these methods are purely ana-
lytic, i.e. they learn a reduced model of the dynamical system underlying the observed time series,
but they miss a generative part that could be used to sample new time series in the high-dimensional
conﬁguration space.

Recently, several learning frameworks for dynamical systems have been proposed that partially ad-
dress the second goal by including a decoder from the latent space back to the space of input features.
Most of these methods primarily aim at obtaining a low-dimensional latent space that encodes the
long-time behavior of the system, and the decoder takes the role of deﬁning or regularizing the learn-
ing problem [30, 8, 14, 19, 23]. In particular none of these models have demonstrated the ability to
generate viable structures in the high-dimensional conﬁguration space, such as a molecular struc-
ture with realistic atom positions in 3D. Finally, some of these models learn a linear model of the
long-timescale dynamics [14, 19], but none of them provide a probabilistic dynamical model that
can be employed in a Bayesian framework. Learning the correct long-time dynamical behavior with
a generative dynamical model is difﬁcult, as demonstrated in [8].

Here, we address these aforementioned gaps by providing a deep learning framework that learns,
based on time-series data, the following components:

1. Probabilistic encodings of the input conﬁguration to a low-dimensional latent space by

neural networks, xt → χ(xt).

2. A true transition probability matrix K describing the system dynamics in latent space for a

ﬁxed time-lag τ :

E [χ(xt+τ )] = E (cid:2)K(cid:62)(τ )χ(xt)(cid:3) .
The probabilistic nature of the method allows us to train it with likelihood maximization
and embed it into a Bayesian framework. In our benchmarks, the transition probability
matrix approximates the long-time behavior of the underlying dynamical system with high
accuracy.

3. A generative model from latent vectors back to conﬁgurations, allowing us to sample the
transition density P(xt+τ |xt) and thus propagate the model in conﬁguration space. We
show for the ﬁrst time that this allows us to sample genuinely new and valid molecular
structures that have not been included in the training data. This makes the method promis-
ing for performing active learning in MD [2, 21], and to predict the future evolution of the
system in other contexts.

2 Deep Generative Markov State Models

Given two conﬁgurations x, y ∈ Rd, where Rd is a potentially high-dimensional space of system
conﬁgurations (e.g. the positions of atoms in a molecular system), Markovian dynamics are deﬁned
by the transition density P(xt+τ = y|xt = x). Here we represent the transition density between m
states in the following form (Fig. 1):

P(xt+τ = y|xt = x) = χ(x)(cid:62)q(y; τ ) =

χi(x)qi(y; τ ).

(1)

m
(cid:88)

i=1

Here, χ(x)(cid:62) = [χ1(x), ..., χm(x)] represent the probability of conﬁguration x to be in a metastable
(long-lived) state i

Consequently, these functions are nonnegative (χi(x) ≥ 0∀x) and sum up to one ((cid:80)
i χi(x) = 1∀x).
The functions χ(x) can, e.g., be represented by a neural network mapping from Rd to Rm with a

χi(x) = P(xt ∈ state i | xt = x).

Figure 1: Schematic of Deep Generative Markov State Models (DeepGenMSMs) and the rewiring
trick. The function χ, here represented by neural networks, maps the time-lagged input conﬁgura-
tions to metastable states whose dynamics are governed by a transition probability matrix K. The
generator samples the distribution xt+τ ∼ q by employing a generative network that can produce
novel conﬁgurations (or by resampling xt+τ in DeepResampleMSMs). The rewiring trick consists
of reconnecting the probabilistic networks q and χ such that the time propagation in latent space
can be sampled: From the latent state χ(xt), we generate a time-lagged conﬁguration xt+τ using
q, and then transform it back to the latent space, χ(xt+τ ). Each application of the rewired net-
work samples the latent space transitions, thus providing the statistics to estimate the Markov model
transition matrix K(τ ), which is needed for analysis. This trick allows K(τ ) to be estimated with
desired constraints, such as detailed balance.

SoftMax output layer. Additionally, we have the probability densities
qi(y; τ ) = P(xt+τ = y|xt ∈ state i)
that deﬁne the probability density of the system to “land” at conﬁguration y after making one time-
step. We thus brieﬂy call them “landing densities”.

2.1 Kinetics

Before addressing how to estimate χ and q from data, we describe how to perform the standard
calculations and analyses that are common in the Markov modeling ﬁeld for a model of the form
(1).

In Markov modeling, one is typically interested in the kinetics of the system, i.e.
the long-time
behavior of the dynamics. This is captured by the elements of the transition matrix K = [kij]
between metastable states. K can be computed as follows: the product of the probability density
to jump from metastable i to a conﬁguration y and the probability that this conﬁguration belongs to
metastable state j, integrated over the whole conﬁguration space.

kij(τ ) =

qi(y; τ )χj(y) dy.

(2)

(cid:90)

y

Practically, this calculation is implemented via the “rewiring trick” shown in Fig. 1, where the
conﬁguration space integral is approximated by drawing samples from the generator. The estimated
probabilistic functions q and χ deﬁne, by construction, a valid transition probability matrix K,
i.e. kij ≥ 0 and (cid:80)
j kij = 1. As a result, the proposed models have a structural advantage over
other high-accuracy Markov state modeling approaches that deﬁne metastable states in a fuzzy or
probabilistic manner but do not guarantee a valid transition matrix [12, 15] (See Supplementary
Material for more details.).

The stationary (equilibrium) probabilities of the metastable states are given by the vector π = [πi]
that solves the eigenvalue problem with eigenvalue λ1 = 1:

and the stationary (equilibrium) distribution in conﬁguration space is given by:

π = K(cid:62)π,

µ(y) =

πiqi(y; τ ) = π(cid:62)q(y; τ ).

(cid:88)

i

Finally, for a ﬁxed deﬁnition of states via χ, the self-consistency of Markov models may be tested
using the Chapman-Kolmogorov equation

Kn(τ ) ≈ K(nτ )

which involves estimating the functions q(y; nτ ) at different lag times nτ and comparing the re-
sulting transition matrices with the nth power of the transition matrix obtained at lag time τ . A
consequence of Eq. (5) is that the relaxation times

ti(τ ) = −

τ
log |λi(τ )|

are independent of the lag time τ at which K is estimated [27]. Here, λi with i = 2, ..., m are the
nontrivial eigenvalues of K.

2.2 Maximum Likelihood (ML) learning of DeepResampleMSM

Given trajectories {xt}t=1,...,T , how do we estimate the membership probabilities χ(x), and how
do we learn and sample the landing densities q(y)? We start with a model, where q(y) are di-
rectly derived from the observed (empirical) observations, i.e. they are point densities on the input
conﬁgurations {xt}, given by:

1
¯γi
Here, ρ(y) is the empirical distribution, which in the case of ﬁnite sample size is simply ρ(y) =
t=1 δ(y − xt+τ ), and γi(y) is a trainable weighting function. The normalization factor

γi(y)ρ(y).

qi(y) =

t=1 γi(xt+τ ) = Ey∼ρ1[γi(y)] ensures (cid:82)

y qi(y) dy = 1.

¯γi = 1

Now we can optimize χi and γi by maximizing the likelihood (ML) of generating the pairs
(xt, xt+τ ) observed in the data. The log-likelihood is given by:

and is maximized to train a deep MSM with the structure shown in Fig. 1.

i=1

Alternatively, we can optimize χi and γi using the Variational Approach for Markov Processes
(VAMP) [31]. However, we found the ML approach to perform signiﬁcantly better in our tests, and
we thus include the VAMP training approach only in the Supplementary Material without elaborat-
ing on it further.

Given the networks χ and γ, we compute q from Eq. (7). Employing the rewiring trick shown in
Fig. 1 results in computing the transition matrix by a simple average over all conﬁgurations:

The deep MSMs described in this section are neural network generalizations of traditional MSMs
– they learn a mapping from conﬁgurations to metastable states, where they aim obtaining a good
approximation of the kinetics of the underlying dynamical system, by means of the transition matrix
K. However, since the landing distribution q in these methods is derived from the empirical distribu-
tion (7), any generated trajectory will only resample conﬁgurations from the input data. To highlight
this property, we will refer to the deep MSMs with the present methodology as DeepResampleMSM.

2.3 Energy Distance learning of DeepGenMSM

In contrast to DeepResampleMSM, we now want to learn deep generative MSM (DeepGenMSM),
which can be used to generate trajectories that do not only resample from input data, but can produce
genuinely new conﬁgurations. To this end, we train a generative model to mimic the empirical
distribution qi(y):

y = G(ei, (cid:15)),
(10)
where the vector ei ∈ Rm is a one-hot encoding of the metastable state, and (cid:15) is a i.i.d. random
vector where each component samples from a Gaussian normal distribution.

Here we train the generator G by minimizing the conditional Energy Distance (ED), whose choice is
motivated in the Supplementary Material. The standard ED, introduced in [28], is a metric between
the distributions of random vectors, deﬁned as

DE (P(x), P(y)) = E [2 (cid:107)x − y(cid:107) − (cid:107)x − x(cid:48)(cid:107) − (cid:107)y − y(cid:48)(cid:107)]

(11)

for two real-valued random variables x and y. x, x(cid:48), y, y(cid:48) are independently distributed according to
the distributions of x, y. Based on this metric, we introduce the conditional energy distance between
the transition density of the system and that of the generative model:

D (cid:44) E [DE (P(xt+τ |xt), P(ˆxt+τ |xt)) |xt]

= E (cid:2)2 (cid:107)ˆxt+τ − xt+τ (cid:107) − (cid:13)

(cid:13)ˆxt+τ − ˆx(cid:48)

t+τ

(cid:13)

(cid:13)xt+τ − x(cid:48)

t+τ

(cid:13)
(cid:3)
(cid:13)

(12)

t+τ are distributed according to the transition density for given xt and ˆxt+τ , ˆx(cid:48)

Here xt+τ and x(cid:48)
t+τ
are independent outputs of the generative model conditioned on xt. Implementing the expectation
value with an empirical average results in an estimate for D that is unbiased, up to an additive
constant. We train G to minimize D. See Supplementary Material for detailed derivations and the
training algorithm used.

After training, the transition matrix can be obtained by using the rewiring trick (Fig. 1), where the
conﬁguration space integral is sampled by generating samples from the generator:

[K]ij = E(cid:15) [χj (G(ei, (cid:15)))] .

3 Results

Below we establish our framework by applying it to two well-deﬁned benchmark systems that ex-
hibit metastable stochastic dynamics. We validate the stationary distribution and kinetics by comput-
ing χ(x), q(y), the stationary distribution µ(y) and the relaxation times ti(τ ) and comparing them
with reference solutions. We will also test the abilities of DeepGenMSMs to generate physically
valid molecular conﬁgurations.

The networks were implemented using PyTorch [20] and Tensorﬂow [6]. For the full code and all
details about the neural network architecture, hyper-parameters and training algorithm, please refer

3.1 Diffusion in Prinz potential

We ﬁrst apply our framework to the time-discretized diffusion process xt+∆t = −∆t ∇V (xt) +
√
2∆t ˙ηt with ∆t = 0.01 in the Prinz potential V (xt) introduced in [22] (Fig. 2a). For this system
we know exact results for benchmarking: the stationary distribution and relaxation timescales (black
lines in Fig. 2b,c) and the transition density (Fig. 2d). We simulate trajectories of lengths 250, 000
and 125, 000 time steps for training and validation, respectively. For all methods, we repeat the data
generation and model estimation process 10 times and compute mean and standard deviations for
all quantities of interest, which thus represent the mean and variance of the estimators.

The functions χ, γ and G are represented with densely connected neural networks. The details of
the architecture and the training procedure can be found in the Supplementary Information.

We compare DeepResampleMSMs and DeepGenMSMs with standard MSMs using four or ten
states obtained with k-means clustering. Note that standard MSMs do not directly operate on con-
ﬁguration space. When using an MSM, the transition density (Eq. 1) is thus simulated by:

∼Ki,∗−→ j
i.e., we ﬁnd the cluster i associated with a conﬁguration xt, which is deterministic for regular MSMs,
then sample the cluster j at the next time-step, and sample from the conditional distribution of
conﬁgurations in cluster j to generate xt+τ .

∼ρj (y)
−→ xt+τ ,

χ(xt)
−→ i

xt

Both DeepResampleMSMs trained with the ML method and standard MSMs can reproduce the
stationary distribution within statistical uncertainty (Fig. 2b). For long lag times τ , all methods con-
verge from below to the correct relaxation timescales (Fig. 2c), as expected from theory [22, 18].
When using equally many states (here: four), the DeepResampleMSM has a much lower bias in the
relaxation timescales than the standard MSM. This is expected from approximation theory, as the
DeepResampleMSMs represents the four metastable states with a meaningful, smooth membership
functions χ(xt), while the four-state MSM cuts the memberships hard at boundaries with low sam-
ple density (Supplementary Fig. 1). When increasing the number of metastable states, the bias of
all estimators will reduce. An MSM with ten states is needed to perform approximately equal to a
four-state DeepResampleMSM (Fig. 2c). All subsequent analyses use a lag time of τ = 5.

The DeepResampleMSM generates a transition density that is very similar to the exact density,
while the MSM transition densities are coarse-grained by virtue of the fact that χ(xt) performs a
hard clustering in an MSM (Fig. 2d). This impression is conﬁrmed when computing the Kullback-
Leibler divergence of the distributions (Fig. 2e).

Encouraged by the accurate results of DeepResampleMSMs, we now train DeepGenMSM, either
by training both the χ and q networks by minimizing the energy distance (ED), or by taking χ
from a ML-trained DeepResampleMSM and only training the q network by minimizing the energy
distance (ML-ED). The stationary densities, relaxation timescales and transition densities can still
be approximated in these settings, although the DeepGenMSMs exhibit larger statistical ﬂuctuations
than the resampling MSMs (Fig. 3). ML-ED appears to perform slightly better than ED alone, likely
because reusing χ from the ML training makes the problem of training the generator easier.

For a one-dimensional example like the Prinz potential, learning a generative model does not provide
any added value, as the distributions can be well approximated by the empirical distributions. The
fact that we can still get approximately correct results for stationary, kinetics and dynamical proper-
ties encourages us to use DeepGenMSMs for a higher-dimensional example, where the generation
of conﬁgurations is a hard problem.

3.2 Alanine dipeptide

We use explicit-solvent MD simulations of Alanine dipeptide as a second example. Our aim is
the learn stationary and kinetic properties, but especially to learn a generative model that generates
genuinely novel but physically meaningful conﬁgurations. One 250 ns trajectory with a storage
interval of 1 ps is used and split 80%/20% for training and validation – see [15] for details of the
simulation setup. We characterize all structures by the three-dimensional Cartesian coordinates of
the heavy atoms, resulting in a 30 dimensional conﬁguration space. While we do not have exact
results for Alanine dipeptide, the system is small enough and well enough sampled, such that high-

pleMSM (c) Relaxation timescales.

quality estimates of stationary and kinetic properties can be obtained from a very ﬁne MSM [22].
We therefore deﬁne an MSM build on 400 equally sized grid areas in the (φ, ψ)-plane as a reference
at a lag time of τ = 25 ps that has been validated by established methods [22].

Neural network and training details are again found at the git repository and in the Supplementary
Information.

For comparison with deep MSMs, we build two standard MSMs following a state of the art protocol:
we transform input conﬁgurations with a kinetic map preserving 95% of the cumulative kinetic
variance [17], followed by k-means clustering, where k = 6 and k = 100 are used.

DeepResampleMSM trained with ML method approximate the stationary distribution very well (Fig.
4a). The reference MSM assigns a slightly lower weight to the lowest-populated state 6, but other-
wise the data, reference distribution and deep MSM distribution are visually indistinguishable. The
relaxation timescales estimated by a six-state DeepResampleMSM are signiﬁcantly better than with
six-state standard MSMs. MSMs with 100 states have a similar performance as the deep MSMs but
this comes at the cost of a model with a much larger latent space.

Finally, we test DeepGenMSMs for Alanine dipeptide where χ is trained with the ML method and
the generator is then trained using ED (ML-ED). The stationary distribution generated by simulat-
ing the DeepGenMSM recursively results in a stationary distribution which is very similar to the
reference distribution in states 1-4 with small φ values (Fig. 4a). States number 5 and 6 with large
φ values are captured, but their shapes and weights are somewhat distorted (Fig. 4a). The one-step
transition densities predicted by the generator are high quality for all states (Suppl. Fig. 2), thus
the differences observed for the stationary distribution must come from small errors made in the
transitions between metastable states that are very rarely observed for states 5 and 6. These rare
events result in poor training data for the generator. However, the DeepGenMSMs approximates the
kinetics well within the uncertainty that is mostly due to estimator variance (Fig. 4c).

Now we ask whether DeepGenMSMs can sample valid structures in the 30-dimensional conﬁgura-
tion space, i.e., if the placement of atoms is physically meaningful. As we generate conﬁgurations
in Cartesian space, we ﬁrst check if the internal coordinates are physically viable by comparing
all bond lengths and angles between real MD data and generated trajectories (Fig. 5). The true
bond lengths and angles are almost perfectly Gaussian distributed, and we thus normalize them by
shifting each distribution to a mean of 0 and scaling it to have standard deviation 1, which results
all reference distributions to collapse to a normal distribution (Fig. 5a,c). We normalize the gener-
ated distribution with the mean and standard distribution of the true data. Although there are clear
differences (Fig. 5b,d), these distributions are very encouraging. Bonds and angles are very stiff de-
grees of freedom, and the fact that most differences in mean and standard deviation are small when
compared to the true ﬂuctuation width means that the generated structures are close to physically
accurate and could be reﬁned by little additional MD simulation effort.

Finally, we perform an experiment to test whether the DeepGenMSM is able to generate genuinely
new conﬁgurations that do exist for Alanine dipeptide but have not been seen in the training data. In
other words, can the generator “extrapolate” in a meaningful way? This is a fundamental question,
because simulating MD is exorbitantly expensive, with each simulation time step being computation-
ally expensive but progressing time only of the order of 10−15 seconds, while often total simulation

timescales of 10−3 seconds or longer are needed. A DeepGenMSM that makes leaps of length τ
– orders of magnitude larger than the MD simulation time-step – and has even a small chance of
generating new and meaningful structures would be extremely valuable to discover new states and
thereby accelerate MD sampling.

To test this ability, we conduct six experiments, in each of which we remove all data belonging to one
of the six metastable states of Alanine dipeptide (6a). We train a DeepGenMSM with each of these
datasets separately, and simulate it to predict the stationary distribution (6b). While the generated
stationary distributions are skewed and the shape of the distribution in the (φ, ψ) range with missing-
data are not quantitatively predicted, the DeepGenMSMs do indeed predict conﬁgurations where no
training data was present (6b). Surprisingly, the quality of most of these conﬁgurations is high (6c).
While the structures of the two low-populated states 5-6 do not look realistic, each of the metastable
states 1-4 are generated with high quality, as shown by the overlap of a real MD structure and the
100 most similar generated structures (6c).

In conclusion, deep MSMs provide high-quality models of the stationary and kinetic properties for
stochastic dynamical systems such as MD simulations.
In contrast to other high-quality models
such as VAMPnets, the resulting model is truly probabilistic and can thus be physically interpreted
and be used in a Bayesian framework. For the ﬁrst time, it was shown that generating dynamical
trajectories in a 30-dimensional molecular conﬁguration space results in sampling of physically
realistic molecular structures. While Alanine dipeptide is a small system compared to proteins and
other macromolecules that are of biological interest, our results demonstrate that efﬁcient sampling
of new molecular structures is possible with generative dynamic models, and improved methods
can be built upon this. Future methods will especially need to address the difﬁculties of generating
valid conﬁgurations in low-probability regimes, and it is likely that the energy distance used here
for generator training needs to be revisited to achieve this goal.

Analysis of transition matrices

The transition matrix K(τ ) = [kij(τ )] ∈ Rm×m is deﬁned as

kij(τ ) = P(xt+τ ∈ state j|xt ∈ state i).

Then, according to (1), we have

kij(τ ) =

P(xt+τ = y|xt ∈ state i) · P(xt+τ ∈ state j|xt+τ = y)dy

(cid:90)

(cid:90)

=

qi(y; τ )χj(y) dy,

and

If χ, q satisfy the conditions

kij(nτ ) = [K(τ )n]ij .

χi(x) ≥ 0, (cid:80)
j χj(x) = 1,
qi(x; τ ) ≥ 0, (cid:82) qi(y; τ )dy = 1, ∀x, i,
j kij(τ ) = 1, i.e., K(τ ) computed from χ, q is a valid transition

we have kij(τ ) ≥ 0 and (cid:80)

= µ(y),

which shows µ is the stationary distribution of model (1).

VAMP-E training of deep MSMs

An alternative to ML training is to employ a score from the Variational Approach of Markov Pro-
cesses (VAMP) [31]. The VAMP-E score has the advantage over other VAMP scores employed
previously [15] that we do not have to specify the rank of the model [31]. The VAMP-E score is
computed as

RE = tr

(cid:16)

2C01 ¯Γ−1 − C00 ¯Γ−1C11 ¯Γ−1(cid:17)

(14)

which depends on covariance matrices estimated from the transformed data:

[C00]ij = Et[χi(xt)χj(xt)]
[C11]ij = Et[γi(xt+τ )γj(xt+τ )]
[C01]ij = Et[χi(xt)γj(xt+τ )]
¯Γ = diag(¯γ1, . . . , ¯γm).
We can use the standard empirical estimators to compute Et. We can then train a deep MSM using
the structure shown in Fig. 1 by maximizing (14).

Using the Energy Distance to train generative networks

The Energy Distance (ED) [28] is a metric that measures the difference between the distributions of
two real valued random vectors x and y, and is deﬁned as

DE(P(x), P(y)) = E [2 (cid:107)x − y(cid:107) − (cid:107)x − x(cid:48)(cid:107) − (cid:107)y − y(cid:48)(cid:107)] .
(15)
Here, x(cid:48), y(cid:48) are independently distributed according to the distributions of y, z. Therefore, the con-
ditional energy distance given in (12) is equal to the mean value of the energy distance between the

11

conditional distributions P(xt+τ |xt) and P(ˆxt+τ |xt) for all xt, and satisﬁes that D ≥ 0 and D = 0
if and only if P(xt+τ |xt) = P(ˆxt+τ |xt) for all xt.

Motivation of Energy Distance as the training metric

The major advantages of ED are:

1. It can be unbiasedly estimated from the data without an extra “adversarial” network as in

GANs.

2. Unlike the KL divergence (see example 1 in [1]), ED does not diverge in the case of few

data points (small batch sizes) or low populated probability density areas.

3. As a speciﬁc Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD), ED can avoid the problem of popular
kernel-MMDs that the gradients of cost functions are vanished if the generated samples
are far away from the training data, and therefore achieve higher efﬁciency when learning
generative models.

Network architecture and training procedure

All neural networks representing the functions χ, γ and G for the Prinz potential are using 64
nodes in all 4 hidden layers and batch normalization after each layer [9]. Rectiﬁed linear activation
functions (ReLUs) are used, except for the output layer of χ which uses SoftMax and the output
layer of G which has a linear activation function. Both χ and γ have 4 output nodes, and G receives
a four-dimensional 1-hot-encoding of the metastable state plus a four-dimensional noise vector as
inputs. Optimization is done using Adam [10], with early stopping checking if the validation score
is not increasing over 5 epochs. The learning rate for the training of χ, γ is λ = 10−3, and for G
λ = 10−5 with a batchsize of 100. We are using a time-lag of τ = 5 frames.

For alanine dipeptide, χ and γ consist both of 3 residual blocks [7] built of 3 layers all having 100
nodes, with exponential linear units (ELUs) [5], and batch normalization for each layer. The output
layer has 6 output nodes, where χ uses a softmax activation function and γ a RELU, respectively.
In order to ﬁnd all slow processes, it was necessary to pre-train χ with the VAMPnet method [15].
The generator G uses 6 noise inputs and a six-dimensional 1-hot-encoding of the metastable state
and the ML-ED scheme. Networks are trained with Adam until the validation score converges with
a learning rate of λ = 10−5 for χ, γ using 8000 as batchsize and λ = 10−4 for G using 1500 frames
for a batch. All subsequent analyses that use a ﬁxed lag time employ τ = 1 ps.

For ﬁnding the hyperparameter we performed a restricted grid search, which showed comparing the
KL divergence between the modeled distributions that the result does only marginally depend on the
choice of the parameters (see 1 for an example).

Abstract

We propose a deep generative Markov State Model (DeepGenMSM) learning
framework for inference of metastable dynamical systems and prediction of tra-
jectories. After unsupervised training on time series data, the model contains (i)
a probabilistic encoder that maps from high-dimensional conﬁguration space to a
small-sized vector indicating the membership to metastable (long-lived) states, (ii)
a Markov chain that governs the transitions between metastable states and facili-
tates analysis of the long-time dynamics, and (iii) a generative part that samples
the conditional distribution of conﬁgurations in the next time step. The model
can be operated in a recursive fashion to generate trajectories to predict the sys-
tem evolution from a deﬁned starting state and propose new conﬁgurations. The
DeepGenMSM is demonstrated to provide accurate estimates of the long-time ki-
netics and generate valid distributions for molecular dynamics (MD) benchmark
systems. Remarkably, we show that DeepGenMSMs are able to make long time-
steps in molecular conﬁguration space and generate physically realistic structures
in regions that were not seen in training data.

Introduction

Complex dynamical systems that exhibit events on vastly different timescales are ubiquitous in sci-
ence and engineering. For example, molecular dynamics (MD) of biomolecules involve fast vibra-
tions on the timescales of 10−15 seconds, while their biological function is often related to the rare
switching events between long-lived states on timescales of 10−3 seconds or longer. In weather and
climate systems, local ﬂuctuations in temperature and pressure ﬁelds occur within minutes or hours,
while global changes are often subject to periodic motion and drift over years or decades. Primary
goals in the analysis of complex dynamical systems include:

1. Deriving an interpretable model of the essential long-time dynamical properties of these

systems, such as the stationary behavior or lifetimes/cycle times of slow processes.

2. Simulating the dynamical system, e.g., to predict the system’s future evolution or to sample

previously unobserved system conﬁgurations.

A state-of-the-art approach for the ﬁrst goal is to learn a Markovian model from time-series data,
which is theoretically justiﬁed by the fact that physical systems are inherently Markovian. In prac-
tice, the long-time behavior of dynamical systems can be accurately described in a Markovian model
when suitable features or variables are used, and when the time resolution of the model is sufﬁciently
coarse such that the time-evolution can be represented with a manageable number of dynamical
modes [25, 11]. In stochastic dynamical systems, such as MD simulation, variants of Markov state
models (MSMs) are commonly used [3, 24, 22]. In MSMs, the conﬁguration space is discretized,
e.g., using a clustering method, and the dynamics between clusters are then described by a matrix

of transition probabilities [22]. The analogous approach for deterministic dynamical systems such
as complex ﬂuid ﬂows is called Koopman analysis, where time propagation is approximated by a
linear model in a suitable function space transformation of the ﬂow variables [16, 26, 29, 4]. The
recently proposed VAMPnets learn an optimal feature transformation from full conﬁguration space
to a low-dimensional latent space in which the Markovian model is built by variational optimization
of a neural network [15]. When the VAMPnet has a probabilistic output (e.g. SoftMax layer), the
Markovian model conserves probability, but is not guaranteed to be a valid transition probability
matrix with nonnegative elements. A related work for deterministic dynamical systems is Extended
Dynamic Mode Decomposition with dictionary learning [13]. All of these methods are purely ana-
lytic, i.e. they learn a reduced model of the dynamical system underlying the observed time series,
but they miss a generative part that could be used to sample new time series in the high-dimensional
conﬁguration space.

Recently, several learning frameworks for dynamical systems have been proposed that partially ad-
dress the second goal by including a decoder from the latent space back to the space of input features.
Most of these methods primarily aim at obtaining a low-dimensional latent space that encodes the
long-time behavior of the system, and the decoder takes the role of deﬁning or regularizing the learn-
ing problem [30, 8, 14, 19, 23]. In particular none of these models have demonstrated the ability to
generate viable structures in the high-dimensional conﬁguration space, such as a molecular struc-
ture with realistic atom positions in 3D. Finally, some of these models learn a linear model of the
long-timescale dynamics [14, 19], but none of them provide a probabilistic dynamical model that
can be employed in a Bayesian framework. Learning the correct long-time dynamical behavior with
a generative dynamical model is difﬁcult, as demonstrated in [8].

Here, we address these aforementioned gaps by providing a deep learning framework that learns,
based on time-series data, the following components:

1. Probabilistic encodings of the input conﬁguration to a low-dimensional latent space by

neural networks, xt → χ(xt).

2. A true transition probability matrix K describing the system dynamics in latent space for a

ﬁxed time-lag τ :

E [χ(xt+τ )] = E (cid:2)K(cid:62)(τ )χ(xt)(cid:3) .
The probabilistic nature of the method allows us to train it with likelihood maximization
and embed it into a Bayesian framework. In our benchmarks, the transition probability
matrix approximates the long-time behavior of the underlying dynamical system with high
accuracy.

3. A generative model from latent vectors back to conﬁgurations, allowing us to sample the
transition density P(xt+τ |xt) and thus propagate the model in conﬁguration space. We
show for the ﬁrst time that this allows us to sample genuinely new and valid molecular
structures that have not been included in the training data. This makes the method promis-
ing for performing active learning in MD [2, 21], and to predict the future evolution of the
system in other contexts.

2 Deep Generative Markov State Models

Given two conﬁgurations x, y ∈ Rd, where Rd is a potentially high-dimensional space of system
conﬁgurations (e.g. the positions of atoms in a molecular system), Markovian dynamics are deﬁned
by the transition density P(xt+τ = y|xt = x). Here we represent the transition density between m
states in the following form (Fig. 1):

P(xt+τ = y|xt = x) = χ(x)(cid:62)q(y; τ ) =

χi(x)qi(y; τ ).

(1)

m
(cid:88)

i=1

Here, χ(x)(cid:62) = [χ1(x), ..., χm(x)] represent the probability of conﬁguration x to be in a metastable
(long-lived) state i

Consequently, these functions are nonnegative (χi(x) ≥ 0∀x) and sum up to one ((cid:80)
i χi(x) = 1∀x).
The functions χ(x) can, e.g., be represented by a neural network mapping from Rd to Rm with a

χi(x) = P(xt ∈ state i | xt = x).

Figure 1: Schematic of Deep Generative Markov State Models (DeepGenMSMs) and the rewiring
trick. The function χ, here represented by neural networks, maps the time-lagged input conﬁgura-
tions to metastable states whose dynamics are governed by a transition probability matrix K. The
generator samples the distribution xt+τ ∼ q by employing a generative network that can produce
novel conﬁgurations (or by resampling xt+τ in DeepResampleMSMs). The rewiring trick consists
of reconnecting the probabilistic networks q and χ such that the time propagation in latent space
can be sampled: From the latent state χ(xt), we generate a time-lagged conﬁguration xt+τ using
q, and then transform it back to the latent space, χ(xt+τ ). Each application of the rewired net-
work samples the latent space transitions, thus providing the statistics to estimate the Markov model
transition matrix K(τ ), which is needed for analysis. This trick allows K(τ ) to be estimated with
desired constraints, such as detailed balance.

SoftMax output layer. Additionally, we have the probability densities
qi(y; τ ) = P(xt+τ = y|xt ∈ state i)
that deﬁne the probability density of the system to “land” at conﬁguration y after making one time-
step. We thus brieﬂy call them “landing densities”.

2.1 Kinetics

Before addressing how to estimate χ and q from data, we describe how to perform the standard
calculations and analyses that are common in the Markov modeling ﬁeld for a model of the form
(1).

In Markov modeling, one is typically interested in the kinetics of the system, i.e.
the long-time
behavior of the dynamics. This is captured by the elements of the transition matrix K = [kij]
between metastable states. K can be computed as follows: the product of the probability density
to jump from metastable i to a conﬁguration y and the probability that this conﬁguration belongs to
metastable state j, integrated over the whole conﬁguration space.

kij(τ ) =

qi(y; τ )χj(y) dy.

(2)

(cid:90)

y

Practically, this calculation is implemented via the “rewiring trick” shown in Fig. 1, where the
conﬁguration space integral is approximated by drawing samples from the generator. The estimated
probabilistic functions q and χ deﬁne, by construction, a valid transition probability matrix K,
i.e. kij ≥ 0 and (cid:80)
j kij = 1. As a result, the proposed models have a structural advantage over
other high-accuracy Markov state modeling approaches that deﬁne metastable states in a fuzzy or
probabilistic manner but do not guarantee a valid transition matrix [12, 15] (See Supplementary
Material for more details.).

The stationary (equilibrium) probabilities of the metastable states are given by the vector π = [πi]
that solves the eigenvalue problem with eigenvalue λ1 = 1:

and the stationary (equilibrium) distribution in conﬁguration space is given by:

π = K(cid:62)π,

µ(y) =

πiqi(y; τ ) = π(cid:62)q(y; τ ).

(cid:88)

i

Finally, for a ﬁxed deﬁnition of states via χ, the self-consistency of Markov models may be tested
using the Chapman-Kolmogorov equation

Kn(τ ) ≈ K(nτ )

which involves estimating the functions q(y; nτ ) at different lag times nτ and comparing the re-
sulting transition matrices with the nth power of the transition matrix obtained at lag time τ . A
consequence of Eq. (5) is that the relaxation times

ti(τ ) = −

τ
log |λi(τ )|

are independent of the lag time τ at which K is estimated [27]. Here, λi with i = 2, ..., m are the
nontrivial eigenvalues of K.

2.2 Maximum Likelihood (ML) learning of DeepResampleMSM

Given trajectories {xt}t=1,...,T , how do we estimate the membership probabilities χ(x), and how
do we learn and sample the landing densities q(y)? We start with a model, where q(y) are di-
rectly derived from the observed (empirical) observations, i.e. they are point densities on the input
conﬁgurations {xt}, given by:

1
¯γi
Here, ρ(y) is the empirical distribution, which in the case of ﬁnite sample size is simply ρ(y) =
t=1 δ(y − xt+τ ), and γi(y) is a trainable weighting function. The normalization factor

γi(y)ρ(y).

qi(y) =

Now we can optimize χi and γi by maximizing the likelihood (ML) of generating the pairs

and is maximized to train a deep MSM with the structure shown in Fig. 1.

i=1

Alternatively, we can optimize χi and γi using the Variational Approach for Markov Processes
(VAMP) [31]. However, we found the ML approach to perform signiﬁcantly better in our tests, and
we thus include the VAMP training approach only in the Supplementary Material without elaborat-
ing on it further.

Given the networks χ and γ, we compute q from Eq. (7). Employing the rewiring trick shown in
Fig. 1 results in computing the transition matrix by a simple average over all conﬁgurations:

The deep MSMs described in this section are neural network generalizations of traditional MSMs
– they learn a mapping from conﬁgurations to metastable states, where they aim obtaining a good
approximation of the kinetics of the underlying dynamical system, by means of the transition matrix
K. However, since the landing distribution q in these methods is derived from the empirical distribu-
tion (7), any generated trajectory will only resample conﬁgurations from the input data. To highlight
this property, we will refer to the deep MSMs with the present methodology as DeepResampleMSM.

2.3 Energy Distance learning of DeepGenMSM

In contrast to DeepResampleMSM, we now want to learn deep generative MSM (DeepGenMSM),
which can be used to generate trajectories that do not only resample from input data, but can produce
genuinely new conﬁgurations. To this end, we train a generative model to mimic the empirical
distribution qi(y):

y = G(ei, (cid:15)),
(10)
where the vector ei ∈ Rm is a one-hot encoding of the metastable state, and (cid:15) is a i.i.d. random
vector where each component samples from a Gaussian normal distribution.

Here we train the generator G by minimizing the conditional Energy Distance (ED), whose choice is
motivated in the Supplementary Material. The standard ED, introduced in [28], is a metric between
the distributions of random vectors, deﬁned as

DE (P(x), P(y)) = E [2 (cid:107)x − y(cid:107) − (cid:107)x − x(cid:48)(cid:107) − (cid:107)y − y(cid:48)(cid:107)]

(11)

for two real-valued random variables x and y. x, x(cid:48), y, y(cid:48) are independently distributed according to
the distributions of x, y. Based on this metric, we introduce the conditional energy distance between
the transition density of the system and that of the generative model:

D (cid:44) E [DE (P(xt+τ |xt), P(ˆxt+τ |xt)) |xt]

= E (cid:2)2 (cid:107)ˆxt+τ − xt+τ (cid:107) − (cid:13)

(cid:13)ˆxt+τ − ˆx(cid:48)

(cid:13)

(cid:13)xt+τ − x(cid:48)

t+τ

(cid:13)
(cid:3)
(cid:13)

(12)

t+τ are distributed according to the transition density for given xt and ˆxt+τ , ˆx(cid:48)

Here xt+τ and x(cid:48)
t+τ
are independent outputs of the generative model conditioned on xt. Implementing the expectation
value with an empirical average results in an estimate for D that is unbiased, up to an additive
constant. We train G to minimize D. See Supplementary Material for detailed derivations and the
training algorithm used.

After training, the transition matrix can be obtained by using the rewiring trick (Fig. 1), where the
conﬁguration space integral is sampled by generating samples from the generator:

[K]ij = E(cid:15) [χj (G(ei, (cid:15)))] .

(13)

3 Results

Below we establish our framework by applying it to two well-deﬁned benchmark systems that ex-
hibit metastable stochastic dynamics. We validate the stationary distribution and kinetics by comput-
ing χ(x), q(y), the stationary distribution µ(y) and the relaxation times ti(τ ) and comparing them
with reference solutions. We will also test the abilities of DeepGenMSMs to generate physically
valid molecular conﬁgurations.

The networks were implemented using PyTorch [20] and Tensorﬂow [6]. For the full code and all
details about the neural network architecture, hyper-parameters and training algorithm, please refer
to https://github.com/markovmodel/deep_gen_msm.

3.1 Diffusion in Prinz potential

We ﬁrst apply our framework to the time-discretized diffusion process xt+∆t = −∆t ∇V (xt) +
√
2∆t ˙ηt with ∆t = 0.01 in the Prinz potential V (xt) introduced in [22] (Fig. 2a). For this system
we know exact results for benchmarking: the stationary distribution and relaxation timescales (black
lines in Fig. 2b,c) and the transition density (Fig. 2d). We simulate trajectories of lengths 250, 000
and 125, 000 time steps for training and validation, respectively. For all methods, we repeat the data
generation and model estimation process 10 times and compute mean and standard deviations for
all quantities of interest, which thus represent the mean and variance of the estimators.

The functions χ, γ and G are represented with densely connected neural networks. The details of
the architecture and the training procedure can be found in the Supplementary Information.

We compare DeepResampleMSMs and DeepGenMSMs with standard MSMs using four or ten
states obtained with k-means clustering. Note that standard MSMs do not directly operate on con-
ﬁguration space. When using an MSM, the transition density (Eq. 1) is thus simulated by:

∼Ki,∗−→ j
i.e., we ﬁnd the cluster i associated with a conﬁguration xt, which is deterministic for regular MSMs,
then sample the cluster j at the next time-step, and sample from the conditional distribution of
conﬁgurations in cluster j to generate xt+τ .

Both DeepResampleMSMs trained with the ML method and standard MSMs can reproduce the
stationary distribution within statistical uncertainty (Fig. 2b). For long lag times τ , all methods con-
verge from below to the correct relaxation timescales (Fig. 2c), as expected from theory [22, 18].
When using equally many states (here: four), the DeepResampleMSM has a much lower bias in the
relaxation timescales than the standard MSM. This is expected from approximation theory, as the
DeepResampleMSMs represents the four metastable states with a meaningful, smooth membership
functions χ(xt), while the four-state MSM cuts the memberships hard at boundaries with low sam-
ple density (Supplementary Fig. 1). When increasing the number of metastable states, the bias of
all estimators will reduce. An MSM with ten states is needed to perform approximately equal to a
four-state DeepResampleMSM (Fig. 2c). All subsequent analyses use a lag time of τ = 5.

The DeepResampleMSM generates a transition density that is very similar to the exact density,
while the MSM transition densities are coarse-grained by virtue of the fact that χ(xt) performs a
hard clustering in an MSM (Fig. 2d). This impression is conﬁrmed when computing the Kullback-
Leibler divergence of the distributions (Fig. 2e).

Encouraged by the accurate results of DeepResampleMSMs, we now train DeepGenMSM, either
by training both the χ and q networks by minimizing the energy distance (ED), or by taking χ
from a ML-trained DeepResampleMSM and only training the q network by minimizing the energy
distance (ML-ED). The stationary densities, relaxation timescales and transition densities can still
be approximated in these settings, although the DeepGenMSMs exhibit larger statistical ﬂuctuations
than the resampling MSMs (Fig. 3). ML-ED appears to perform slightly better than ED alone, likely
because reusing χ from the ML training makes the problem of training the generator easier.

For a one-dimensional example like the Prinz potential, learning a generative model does not provide
any added value, as the distributions can be well approximated by the empirical distributions. The
fact that we can still get approximately correct results for stationary, kinetics and dynamical proper-
ties encourages us to use DeepGenMSMs for a higher-dimensional example, where the generation
of conﬁgurations is a hard problem.

3.2 Alanine dipeptide

We use explicit-solvent MD simulations of Alanine dipeptide as a second example. Our aim is
the learn stationary and kinetic properties, but especially to learn a generative model that generates
genuinely novel but physically meaningful conﬁgurations. One 250 ns trajectory with a storage
interval of 1 ps is used and split 80%/20% for training and validation – see [15] for details of the
simulation setup. We characterize all structures by the three-dimensional Cartesian coordinates of
the heavy atoms, resulting in a 30 dimensional conﬁguration space. While we do not have exact
results for Alanine dipeptide, the system is small enough and well enough sampled, such that high-

quality estimates of stationary and kinetic properties can be obtained from a very ﬁne MSM [22].
We therefore deﬁne an MSM build on 400 equally sized grid areas in the (φ, ψ)-plane as a reference
at a lag time of τ = 25 ps that has been validated by established methods [22].

Neural network and training details are again found at the git repository and in the Supplementary
Information.

For comparison with deep MSMs, we build two standard MSMs following a state of the art protocol:
we transform input conﬁgurations with a kinetic map preserving 95% of the cumulative kinetic
variance [17], followed by k-means clustering, where k = 6 and k = 100 are used.

DeepResampleMSM trained with ML method approximate the stationary distribution very well (Fig.
4a). The reference MSM assigns a slightly lower weight to the lowest-populated state 6, but other-
wise the data, reference distribution and deep MSM distribution are visually indistinguishable. The
relaxation timescales estimated by a six-state DeepResampleMSM are signiﬁcantly better than with
six-state standard MSMs. MSMs with 100 states have a similar performance as the deep MSMs but
this comes at the cost of a model with a much larger latent space.

Finally, we test DeepGenMSMs for Alanine dipeptide where χ is trained with the ML method and
the generator is then trained using ED (ML-ED). The stationary distribution generated by simulat-
ing the DeepGenMSM recursively results in a stationary distribution which is very similar to the
reference distribution in states 1-4 with small φ values (Fig. 4a). States number 5 and 6 with large
φ values are captured, but their shapes and weights are somewhat distorted (Fig. 4a). The one-step
transition densities predicted by the generator are high quality for all states (Suppl. Fig. 2), thus
the differences observed for the stationary distribution must come from small errors made in the
transitions between metastable states that are very rarely observed for states 5 and 6. These rare
events result in poor training data for the generator. However, the DeepGenMSMs approximates the
kinetics well within the uncertainty that is mostly due to estimator variance (Fig. 4c).

Now we ask whether DeepGenMSMs can sample valid structures in the 30-dimensional conﬁgura-
tion space, i.e., if the placement of atoms is physically meaningful. As we generate conﬁgurations
in Cartesian space, we ﬁrst check if the internal coordinates are physically viable by comparing
all bond lengths and angles between real MD data and generated trajectories (Fig. 5). The true
bond lengths and angles are almost perfectly Gaussian distributed, and we thus normalize them by
shifting each distribution to a mean of 0 and scaling it to have standard deviation 1, which results
all reference distributions to collapse to a normal distribution (Fig. 5a,c). We normalize the gener-
ated distribution with the mean and standard distribution of the true data. Although there are clear
differences (Fig. 5b,d), these distributions are very encouraging. Bonds and angles are very stiff de-
grees of freedom, and the fact that most differences in mean and standard deviation are small when
compared to the true ﬂuctuation width means that the generated structures are close to physically
accurate and could be reﬁned by little additional MD simulation effort.

Finally, we perform an experiment to test whether the DeepGenMSM is able to generate genuinely
new conﬁgurations that do exist for Alanine dipeptide but have not been seen in the training data. In
other words, can the generator “extrapolate” in a meaningful way? This is a fundamental question,
because simulating MD is exorbitantly expensive, with each simulation time step being computation-
ally expensive but progressing time only of the order of 10−15 seconds, while often total simulation

timescales of 10−3 seconds or longer are needed. A DeepGenMSM that makes leaps of length τ
– orders of magnitude larger than the MD simulation time-step – and has even a small chance of
generating new and meaningful structures would be extremely valuable to discover new states and
thereby accelerate MD sampling.

To test this ability, we conduct six experiments, in each of which we remove all data belonging to one
of the six metastable states of Alanine dipeptide (6a). We train a DeepGenMSM with each of these
datasets separately, and simulate it to predict the stationary distribution (6b). While the generated
stationary distributions are skewed and the shape of the distribution in the (φ, ψ) range with missing-
data are not quantitatively predicted, the DeepGenMSMs do indeed predict conﬁgurations where no
training data was present (6b). Surprisingly, the quality of most of these conﬁgurations is high (6c).
While the structures of the two low-populated states 5-6 do not look realistic, each of the metastable
states 1-4 are generated with high quality, as shown by the overlap of a real MD structure and the
100 most similar generated structures (6c).

In conclusion, deep MSMs provide high-quality models of the stationary and kinetic properties for
stochastic dynamical systems such as MD simulations.
In contrast to other high-quality models
such as VAMPnets, the resulting model is truly probabilistic and can thus be physically interpreted
and be used in a Bayesian framework. For the ﬁrst time, it was shown that generating dynamical
trajectories in a 30-dimensional molecular conﬁguration space results in sampling of physically
realistic molecular structures. While Alanine dipeptide is a small system compared to proteins and
other macromolecules that are of biological interest, our results demonstrate that efﬁcient sampling
of new molecular structures is possible with generative dynamic models, and improved methods
can be built upon this. Future methods will especially need to address the difﬁculties of generating
valid conﬁgurations in low-probability regimes, and it is likely that the energy distance used here
for generator training needs to be revisited to achieve this goal.

Analysis of transition matrices

The transition matrix K(τ ) = [kij(τ )] ∈ Rm×m is deﬁned as

kij(τ ) = P(xt+τ ∈ state j|xt ∈ state i).

Then, according to (1), we have

kij(τ ) =

P(xt+τ = y|xt ∈ state i) · P(xt+τ ∈ state j|xt+τ = y)dy

(cid:90)

(cid:90)

=

qi(y; τ )χj(y) dy,

and

If χ, q satisfy the conditions

kij(nτ ) = [K(τ )n]ij .

χi(x) ≥ 0, (cid:80)
j χj(x) = 1,
qi(x; τ ) ≥ 0, (cid:82) qi(y; τ )dy = 1, ∀x, i,
j kij(τ ) = 1, i.e., K(τ ) computed from χ, q is a valid transition

we have kij(τ ) ≥ 0 and (cid:80)
probability matrix.

For the distribution µ deﬁned in (4),

(cid:90)

(cid:90)

P(xt+τ = y|xt = x) · µ(x)dx =

q(y; τ )(cid:62)χ(x) · q(x; τ )(cid:62)πdx

= q(y; τ )(cid:62)π
= µ(y),

which shows µ is the stationary distribution of model (1).

VAMP-E training of deep MSMs

An alternative to ML training is to employ a score from the Variational Approach of Markov Pro-
cesses (VAMP) [31]. The VAMP-E score has the advantage over other VAMP scores employed
previously [15] that we do not have to specify the rank of the model [31]. The VAMP-E score is
computed as

RE = tr

(cid:16)

2C01 ¯Γ−1 − C00 ¯Γ−1C11 ¯Γ−1(cid:17)

(14)

which depends on covariance matrices estimated from the transformed data:

[C00]ij = Et[χi(xt)χj(xt)]
[C11]ij = Et[γi(xt+τ )γj(xt+τ )]
[C01]ij = Et[χi(xt)γj(xt+τ )]
¯Γ = diag(¯γ1, . . . , ¯γm).
We can use the standard empirical estimators to compute Et. We can then train a deep MSM using
the structure shown in Fig. 1 by maximizing (14).

Using the Energy Distance to train generative networks

The Energy Distance (ED) [28] is a metric that measures the difference between the distributions of
two real valued random vectors x and y, and is deﬁned as

DE(P(x), P(y)) = E [2 (cid:107)x − y(cid:107) − (cid:107)x − x(cid:48)(cid:107) − (cid:107)y − y(cid:48)(cid:107)] .
(15)
Here, x(cid:48), y(cid:48) are independently distributed according to the distributions of y, z. Therefore, the con-
ditional energy distance given in (12) is equal to the mean value of the energy distance between the

11

conditional distributions P(xt+τ |xt) and P(ˆxt+τ |xt) for all xt, and satisﬁes that D ≥ 0 and D = 0
if and only if P(xt+τ |xt) = P(ˆxt+τ |xt) for all xt.
Noticing that E (cid:2)(cid:13)

Motivation of Energy Distance as the training metric

The major advantages of ED are:

1. It can be unbiasedly estimated from the data without an extra “adversarial” network as in

GANs.

2. Unlike the KL divergence (see example 1 in [1]), ED does not diverge in the case of few

data points (small batch sizes) or low populated probability density areas.

3. As a speciﬁc Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD), ED can avoid the problem of popular
kernel-MMDs that the gradients of cost functions are vanished if the generated samples
are far away from the training data, and therefore achieve higher efﬁciency when learning
generative models.

Network architecture and training procedure

All neural networks representing the functions χ, γ and G for the Prinz potential are using 64
nodes in all 4 hidden layers and batch normalization after each layer [9]. Rectiﬁed linear activation
functions (ReLUs) are used, except for the output layer of χ which uses SoftMax and the output
layer of G which has a linear activation function. Both χ and γ have 4 output nodes, and G receives
a four-dimensional 1-hot-encoding of the metastable state plus a four-dimensional noise vector as
inputs. Optimization is done using Adam [10], with early stopping checking if the validation score
is not increasing over 5 epochs. The learning rate for the training of χ, γ is λ = 10−3, and for G
λ = 10−5 with a batchsize of 100. We are using a time-lag of τ = 5 frames.

For alanine dipeptide, χ and γ consist both of 3 residual blocks [7] built of 3 layers all having 100
nodes, with exponential linear units (ELUs) [5], and batch normalization for each layer. The output
layer has 6 output nodes, where χ uses a softmax activation function and γ a RELU, respectively.
In order to ﬁnd all slow processes, it was necessary to pre-train χ with the VAMPnet method [15].
The generator G uses 6 noise inputs and a six-dimensional 1-hot-encoding of the metastable state
and the ML-ED scheme. Networks are trained with Adam until the validation score converges with
a learning rate of λ = 10−5 for χ, γ using 8000 as batchsize and λ = 10−4 for G using 1500 frames
for a batch. All subsequent analyses that use a ﬁxed lag time employ τ = 1 ps.

For ﬁnding the hyperparameter we performed a restricted grid search, which showed comparing the
KL divergence between the modeled distributions that the result does only marginally depend on the
choice of the parameters (see 1 for an example).

Abstract

We propose a deep generative Markov State Model (DeepGenMSM) learning
framework for inference of metastable dynamical systems and prediction of tra-
jectories. After unsupervised training on time series data, the model contains (i)
a probabilistic encoder that maps from high-dimensional conﬁguration space to a
small-sized vector indicating the membership to metastable (long-lived) states, (ii)
a Markov chain that governs the transitions between metastable states and facili-
tates analysis of the long-time dynamics, and (iii) a generative part that samples
the conditional distribution of conﬁgurations in the next time step. The model
can be operated in a recursive fashion to generate trajectories to predict the sys-
tem evolution from a deﬁned starting state and propose new conﬁgurations. The
DeepGenMSM is demonstrated to provide accurate estimates of the long-time ki-
netics and generate valid distributions for molecular dynamics (MD) benchmark
systems. Remarkably, we show that DeepGenMSMs are able to make long time-
steps in molecular conﬁguration space and generate physically realistic structures
in regions that were not seen in training data.

Introduction

Complex dynamical systems that exhibit events on vastly different timescales are ubiquitous in sci-
ence and engineering. For example, molecular dynamics (MD) of biomolecules involve fast vibra-
tions on the timescales of 10−15 seconds, while their biological function is often related to the rare
switching events between long-lived states on timescales of 10−3 seconds or longer. In weather and
climate systems, local ﬂuctuations in temperature and pressure ﬁelds occur within minutes or hours,
while global changes are often subject to periodic motion and drift over years or decades. Primary
goals in the analysis of complex dynamical systems include:

1. Deriving an interpretable model of the essential long-time dynamical properties of these

systems, such as the stationary behavior or lifetimes/cycle times of slow processes.

2. Simulating the dynamical system, e.g., to predict the system’s future evolution or to sample

previously unobserved system conﬁgurations.

A state-of-the-art approach for the ﬁrst goal is to learn a Markovian model from time-series data,
which is theoretically justiﬁed by the fact that physical systems are inherently Markovian. In prac-
tice, the long-time behavior of dynamical systems can be accurately described in a Markovian model
when suitable features or variables are used, and when the time resolution of the model is sufﬁciently
coarse such that the time-evolution can be represented with a manageable number of dynamical
modes [25, 11]. In stochastic dynamical systems, such as MD simulation, variants of Markov state
models (MSMs) are commonly used [3, 24, 22]. In MSMs, the conﬁguration space is discretized,
e.g., using a clustering method, and the dynamics between clusters are then described by a matrix

of transition probabilities [22]. The analogous approach for deterministic dynamical systems such
as complex ﬂuid ﬂows is called Koopman analysis, where time propagation is approximated by a
linear model in a suitable function space transformation of the ﬂow variables [16, 26, 29, 4]. The
recently proposed VAMPnets learn an optimal feature transformation from full conﬁguration space
to a low-dimensional latent space in which the Markovian model is built by variational optimization
of a neural network [15]. When the VAMPnet has a probabilistic output (e.g. SoftMax layer), the
Markovian model conserves probability, but is not guaranteed to be a valid transition probability
matrix with nonnegative elements. A related work for deterministic dynamical systems is Extended
Dynamic Mode Decomposition with dictionary learning [13]. All of these methods are purely ana-
lytic, i.e. they learn a reduced model of the dynamical system underlying the observed time series,
but they miss a generative part that could be used to sample new time series in the high-dimensional
conﬁguration space.

Recently, several learning frameworks for dynamical systems have been proposed that partially ad-
dress the second goal by including a decoder from the latent space back to the space of input features.
Most of these methods primarily aim at obtaining a low-dimensional latent space that encodes the
long-time behavior of the system, and the decoder takes the role of deﬁning or regularizing the learn-
ing problem [30, 8, 14, 19, 23]. In particular none of these models have demonstrated the ability to
generate viable structures in the high-dimensional conﬁguration space, such as a molecular struc-
ture with realistic atom positions in 3D. Finally, some of these models learn a linear model of the
long-timescale dynamics [14, 19], but none of them provide a probabilistic dynamical model that
can be employed in a Bayesian framework. Learning the correct long-time dynamical behavior with
a generative dynamical model is difﬁcult, as demonstrated in [8].

Here, we address these aforementioned gaps by providing a deep learning framework that learns,
based on time-series data, the following components:

1. Probabilistic encodings of the input conﬁguration to a low-dimensional latent space by

neural networks, xt → χ(xt).

2. A true transition probability matrix K describing the system dynamics in latent space for a

ﬁxed time-lag τ :

E [χ(xt+τ )] = E (cid:2)K(cid:62)(τ )χ(xt)(cid:3) .
The probabilistic nature of the method allows us to train it with likelihood maximization
and embed it into a Bayesian framework. In our benchmarks, the transition probability
matrix approximates the long-time behavior of the underlying dynamical system with high
accuracy.

3. A generative model from latent vectors back to conﬁgurations, allowing us to sample the
transition density P(xt+τ |xt) and thus propagate the model in conﬁguration space. We
show for the ﬁrst time that this allows us to sample genuinely new and valid molecular
structures that have not been included in the training data. This makes the method promis-
ing for performing active learning in MD [2, 21], and to predict the future evolution of the
system in other contexts.

2 Deep Generative Markov State Models

Given two conﬁgurations x, y ∈ Rd, where Rd is a potentially high-dimensional space of system
conﬁgurations (e.g. the positions of atoms in a molecular system), Markovian dynamics are deﬁned
by the transition density P(xt+τ = y|xt = x). Here we represent the transition density between m
states in the following form (Fig. 1):

P(xt+τ = y|xt = x) = χ(x)(cid:62)q(y; τ ) =

χi(x)qi(y; τ ).

(1)

m
(cid:88)

i=1

Here, χ(x)(cid:62) = [χ1(x), ..., χm(x)] represent the probability of conﬁguration x to be in a metastable
(long-lived) state i

Consequently, these functions are nonnegative (χi(x) ≥ 0∀x) and sum up to one ((cid:80)
i χi(x) = 1∀x).
The functions χ(x) can, e.g., be represented by a neural network mapping from Rd to Rm with a

χi(x) = P(xt ∈ state i | xt = x).

Figure 1: Schematic of Deep Generative Markov State Models (DeepGenMSMs) and the rewiring
trick. The function χ, here represented by neural networks, maps the time-lagged input conﬁgura-
tions to metastable states whose dynamics are governed by a transition probability matrix K. The
generator samples the distribution xt+τ ∼ q by employing a generative network that can produce
novel conﬁgurations (or by resampling xt+τ in DeepResampleMSMs). The rewiring trick consists
of reconnecting the probabilistic networks q and χ such that the time propagation in latent space
can be sampled: From the latent state χ(xt), we generate a time-lagged conﬁguration xt+τ using
q, and then transform it back to the latent space, χ(xt+τ ). Each application of the rewired net-
work samples the latent space transitions, thus providing the statistics to estimate the Markov model
transition matrix K(τ ), which is needed for analysis. This trick allows K(τ ) to be estimated with
desired constraints, such as detailed balance.

SoftMax output layer. Additionally, we have the probability densities
qi(y; τ ) = P(xt+τ = y|xt ∈ state i)
that deﬁne the probability density of the system to “land” at conﬁguration y after making one time-
step. We thus brieﬂy call them “landing densities”.

2.1 Kinetics

Before addressing how to estimate χ and q from data, we describe how to perform the standard
calculations and analyses that are common in the Markov modeling ﬁeld for a model of the form
(1).

In Markov modeling, one is typically interested in the kinetics of the system, i.e.
the long-time
behavior of the dynamics. This is captured by the elements of the transition matrix K = [kij]
between metastable states. K can be computed as follows: the product of the probability density
to jump from metastable i to a conﬁguration y and the probability that this conﬁguration belongs to
metastable state j, integrated over the whole conﬁguration space.

kij(τ ) =

qi(y; τ )χj(y) dy.

(2)

(cid:90)

y

Practically, this calculation is implemented via the “rewiring trick” shown in Fig. 1, where the
conﬁguration space integral is approximated by drawing samples from the generator. The estimated
probabilistic functions q and χ deﬁne, by construction, a valid transition probability matrix K,
i.e. kij ≥ 0 and (cid:80)
j kij = 1. As a result, the proposed models have a structural advantage over
other high-accuracy Markov state modeling approaches that deﬁne metastable states in a fuzzy or
probabilistic manner but do not guarantee a valid transition matrix [12, 15] (See Supplementary
Material for more details.).

The stationary (equilibrium) probabilities of the metastable states are given by the vector π = [πi]
that solves the eigenvalue problem with eigenvalue λ1 = 1:

and the stationary (equilibrium) distribution in conﬁguration space is given by:

π = K(cid:62)π,

µ(y) =

πiqi(y; τ ) = π(cid:62)q(y; τ ).

(cid:88)

i

Finally, for a ﬁxed deﬁnition of states via χ, the self-consistency of Markov models may be tested
using the Chapman-Kolmogorov equation

Kn(τ ) ≈ K(nτ )

which involves estimating the functions q(y; nτ ) at different lag times nτ and comparing the re-
sulting transition matrices with the nth power of the transition matrix obtained at lag time τ . A
consequence of Eq. (5) is that the relaxation times

ti(τ ) = −

τ
log |λi(τ )|

are independent of the lag time τ at which K is estimated [27]. Here, λi with i = 2, ..., m are the
nontrivial eigenvalues of K.

2.2 Maximum Likelihood (ML) learning of DeepResampleMSM

Given trajectories {xt}t=1,...,T , how do we estimate the membership probabilities χ(x), and how
do we learn and sample the landing densities q(y)? We start with a model, where q(y) are di-
rectly derived from the observed (empirical) observations, i.e. they are point densities on the input
conﬁgurations {xt}, given by:

1
¯γi
Here, ρ(y) is the empirical distribution, which in the case of ﬁnite sample size is simply ρ(y) =
t=1 δ(y − xt+τ ), and γi(y) is a trainable weighting function. The normalization factor

γi(y)ρ(y).

qi(y) =

Now we can optimize χi and γi by maximizing the likelihood (ML) of generating the pairs
(xt, xt+τ ) observed in the data. The log-likelihood is given by:

and is maximized to train a deep MSM with the structure shown in Fig. 1.

Alternatively, we can optimize χi and γi using the Variational Approach for Markov Processes
(VAMP) [31]. However, we found the ML approach to perform signiﬁcantly better in our tests, and
we thus include the VAMP training approach only in the Supplementary Material without elaborat-
ing on it further.

Given the networks χ and γ, we compute q from Eq. (7). Employing the rewiring trick shown in
Fig. 1 results in computing the transition matrix by a simple average over all conﬁgurations:

The deep MSMs described in this section are neural network generalizations of traditional MSMs
– they learn a mapping from conﬁgurations to metastable states, where they aim obtaining a good
approximation of the kinetics of the underlying dynamical system, by means of the transition matrix
K. However, since the landing distribution q in these methods is derived from the empirical distribu-
tion (7), any generated trajectory will only resample conﬁgurations from the input data. To highlight
this property, we will refer to the deep MSMs with the present methodology as DeepResampleMSM.

2.3 Energy Distance learning of DeepGenMSM

In contrast to DeepResampleMSM, we now want to learn deep generative MSM (DeepGenMSM),
which can be used to generate trajectories that do not only resample from input data, but can produce
genuinely new conﬁgurations. To this end, we train a generative model to mimic the empirical
distribution qi(y):

y = G(ei, (cid:15)),
(10)
where the vector ei ∈ Rm is a one-hot encoding of the metastable state, and (cid:15) is a i.i.d. random
vector where each component samples from a Gaussian normal distribution.

Here we train the generator G by minimizing the conditional Energy Distance (ED), whose choice is
motivated in the Supplementary Material. The standard ED, introduced in [28], is a metric between
the distributions of random vectors, deﬁned as

DE (P(x), P(y)) = E [2 (cid:107)x − y(cid:107) − (cid:107)x − x(cid:48)(cid:107) − (cid:107)y − y(cid:48)(cid:107)]

(11)

for two real-valued random variables x and y. x, x(cid:48), y, y(cid:48) are independently distributed according to
the distributions of x, y. Based on this metric, we introduce the conditional energy distance between
the transition density of the system and that of the generative model:

D (cid:44) E [DE (P(xt+τ |xt), P(ˆxt+τ |xt)) |xt]

= E (cid:2)2 (cid:107)ˆxt+τ − xt+τ (cid:107) − (cid:13)

(cid:13)ˆxt+τ − ˆx(cid:48)

(cid:13)

(cid:13)xt+τ − x(cid:48)

t+τ

(cid:13)
(cid:3)
(cid:13)

(12)

t+τ are distributed according to the transition density for given xt and ˆxt+τ , ˆx(cid:48)

Here xt+τ and x(cid:48)
t+τ
are independent outputs of the generative model conditioned on xt. Implementing the expectation
value with an empirical average results in an estimate for D that is unbiased, up to an additive
constant. We train G to minimize D. See Supplementary Material for detailed derivations and the
training algorithm used.

After training, the transition matrix can be obtained by using the rewiring trick (Fig. 1), where the
conﬁguration space integral is sampled by generating samples from the generator:

[K]ij = E(cid:15) [χj (G(ei, (cid:15)))] .

(13)

3 Results

Below we establish our framework by applying it to two well-deﬁned benchmark systems that ex-
hibit metastable stochastic dynamics. We validate the stationary distribution and kinetics by comput-
ing χ(x), q(y), the stationary distribution µ(y) and the relaxation times ti(τ ) and comparing them
with reference solutions. We will also test the abilities of DeepGenMSMs to generate physically
valid molecular conﬁgurations.

The networks were implemented using PyTorch [20] and Tensorﬂow [6]. For the full code and all
details about the neural network architecture, hyper-parameters and training algorithm, please refer

3.1 Diffusion in Prinz potential

We ﬁrst apply our framework to the time-discretized diffusion process xt+∆t = −∆t ∇V (xt) +
√
2∆t ˙ηt with ∆t = 0.01 in the Prinz potential V (xt) introduced in [22] (Fig. 2a). For this system
we know exact results for benchmarking: the stationary distribution and relaxation timescales (black
lines in Fig. 2b,c) and the transition density (Fig. 2d). We simulate trajectories of lengths 250, 000
and 125, 000 time steps for training and validation, respectively. For all methods, we repeat the data
generation and model estimation process 10 times and compute mean and standard deviations for
all quantities of interest, which thus represent the mean and variance of the estimators.

The functions χ, γ and G are represented with densely connected neural networks. The details of
the architecture and the training procedure can be found in the Supplementary Information.

We compare DeepResampleMSMs and DeepGenMSMs with standard MSMs using four or ten
states obtained with k-means clustering. Note that standard MSMs do not directly operate on con-
ﬁguration space. When using an MSM, the transition density (Eq. 1) is thus simulated by:

∼Ki,∗−→ j
i.e., we ﬁnd the cluster i associated with a conﬁguration xt, which is deterministic for regular MSMs,
then sample the cluster j at the next time-step, and sample from the conditional distribution of
conﬁgurations in cluster j to generate xt+τ .

Both DeepResampleMSMs trained with the ML method and standard MSMs can reproduce the
stationary distribution within statistical uncertainty (Fig. 2b). For long lag times τ , all methods con-
verge from below to the correct relaxation timescales (Fig. 2c), as expected from theory [22, 18].
When using equally many states (here: four), the DeepResampleMSM has a much lower bias in the
relaxation timescales than the standard MSM. This is expected from approximation theory, as the
DeepResampleMSMs represents the four metastable states with a meaningful, smooth membership
functions χ(xt), while the four-state MSM cuts the memberships hard at boundaries with low sam-
ple density (Supplementary Fig. 1). When increasing the number of metastable states, the bias of
all estimators will reduce. An MSM with ten states is needed to perform approximately equal to a
four-state DeepResampleMSM (Fig. 2c). All subsequent analyses use a lag time of τ = 5.

ML-ED training. (a) Stationary distribution. (b-d) Transition densities. (e) Relaxation timescales.

The DeepResampleMSM generates a transition density that is very similar to the exact density,
while the MSM transition densities are coarse-grained by virtue of the fact that χ(xt) performs a
hard clustering in an MSM (Fig. 2d). This impression is conﬁrmed when computing the Kullback-
Leibler divergence of the distributions (Fig. 2e).

Encouraged by the accurate results of DeepResampleMSMs, we now train DeepGenMSM, either
by training both the χ and q networks by minimizing the energy distance (ED), or by taking χ
from a ML-trained DeepResampleMSM and only training the q network by minimizing the energy
distance (ML-ED). The stationary densities, relaxation timescales and transition densities can still
be approximated in these settings, although the DeepGenMSMs exhibit larger statistical ﬂuctuations
than the resampling MSMs (Fig. 3). ML-ED appears to perform slightly better than ED alone, likely
because reusing χ from the ML training makes the problem of training the generator easier.

For a one-dimensional example like the Prinz potential, learning a generative model does not provide
any added value, as the distributions can be well approximated by the empirical distributions. The
fact that we can still get approximately correct results for stationary, kinetics and dynamical proper-
ties encourages us to use DeepGenMSMs for a higher-dimensional example, where the generation
of conﬁgurations is a hard problem.

3.2 Alanine dipeptide

We use explicit-solvent MD simulations of Alanine dipeptide as a second example. Our aim is
the learn stationary and kinetic properties, but especially to learn a generative model that generates
genuinely novel but physically meaningful conﬁgurations. One 250 ns trajectory with a storage
interval of 1 ps is used and split 80%/20% for training and validation – see [15] for details of the
simulation setup. We characterize all structures by the three-dimensional Cartesian coordinates of
the heavy atoms, resulting in a 30 dimensional conﬁguration space. While we do not have exact
results for Alanine dipeptide, the system is small enough and well enough sampled, such that high-

quality estimates of stationary and kinetic properties can be obtained from a very ﬁne MSM [22].
We therefore deﬁne an MSM build on 400 equally sized grid areas in the (φ, ψ)-plane as a reference
at a lag time of τ = 25 ps that has been validated by established methods [22].

Neural network and training details are again found at the git repository and in the Supplementary
Information.

For comparison with deep MSMs, we build two standard MSMs following a state of the art protocol:
we transform input conﬁgurations with a kinetic map preserving 95% of the cumulative kinetic
variance [17], followed by k-means clustering, where k = 6 and k = 100 are used.

DeepResampleMSM trained with ML method approximate the stationary distribution very well (Fig.
4a). The reference MSM assigns a slightly lower weight to the lowest-populated state 6, but other-
wise the data, reference distribution and deep MSM distribution are visually indistinguishable. The
relaxation timescales estimated by a six-state DeepResampleMSM are signiﬁcantly better than with
six-state standard MSMs. MSMs with 100 states have a similar performance as the deep MSMs but
this comes at the cost of a model with a much larger latent space.

Finally, we test DeepGenMSMs for Alanine dipeptide where χ is trained with the ML method and
the generator is then trained using ED (ML-ED). The stationary distribution generated by simulat-
ing the DeepGenMSM recursively results in a stationary distribution which is very similar to the
reference distribution in states 1-4 with small φ values (Fig. 4a). States number 5 and 6 with large
φ values are captured, but their shapes and weights are somewhat distorted (Fig. 4a). The one-step
transition densities predicted by the generator are high quality for all states (Suppl. Fig. 2), thus
the differences observed for the stationary distribution must come from small errors made in the
transitions between metastable states that are very rarely observed for states 5 and 6. These rare
events result in poor training data for the generator. However, the DeepGenMSMs approximates the
kinetics well within the uncertainty that is mostly due to estimator variance (Fig. 4c).

Now we ask whether DeepGenMSMs can sample valid structures in the 30-dimensional conﬁgura-
tion space, i.e., if the placement of atoms is physically meaningful. As we generate conﬁgurations
in Cartesian space, we ﬁrst check if the internal coordinates are physically viable by comparing
all bond lengths and angles between real MD data and generated trajectories (Fig. 5). The true
bond lengths and angles are almost perfectly Gaussian distributed, and we thus normalize them by
shifting each distribution to a mean of 0 and scaling it to have standard deviation 1, which results
all reference distributions to collapse to a normal distribution (Fig. 5a,c). We normalize the gener-
ated distribution with the mean and standard distribution of the true data. Although there are clear
differences (Fig. 5b,d), these distributions are very encouraging. Bonds and angles are very stiff de-
grees of freedom, and the fact that most differences in mean and standard deviation are small when
compared to the true ﬂuctuation width means that the generated structures are close to physically
accurate and could be reﬁned by little additional MD simulation effort.

Finally, we perform an experiment to test whether the DeepGenMSM is able to generate genuinely
new conﬁgurations that do exist for Alanine dipeptide but have not been seen in the training data. In
other words, can the generator “extrapolate” in a meaningful way? This is a fundamental question,
because simulating MD is exorbitantly expensive, with each simulation time step being computation-
ally expensive but progressing time only of the order of 10−15 seconds, while often total simulation

timescales of 10−3 seconds or longer are needed. A DeepGenMSM that makes leaps of length τ
– orders of magnitude larger than the MD simulation time-step – and has even a small chance of
generating new and meaningful structures would be extremely valuable to discover new states and
thereby accelerate MD sampling.

To test this ability, we conduct six experiments, in each of which we remove all data belonging to one
of the six metastable states of Alanine dipeptide (6a). We train a DeepGenMSM with each of these
datasets separately, and simulate it to predict the stationary distribution (6b). While the generated
stationary distributions are skewed and the shape of the distribution in the (φ, ψ) range with missing-
data are not quantitatively predicted, the DeepGenMSMs do indeed predict conﬁgurations where no
training data was present (6b). Surprisingly, the quality of most of these conﬁgurations is high (6c).
While the structures of the two low-populated states 5-6 do not look realistic, each of the metastable
states 1-4 are generated with high quality, as shown by the overlap of a real MD structure and the
100 most similar generated structures (6c).

In conclusion, deep MSMs provide high-quality models of the stationary and kinetic properties for
stochastic dynamical systems such as MD simulations.
In contrast to other high-quality models
such as VAMPnets, the resulting model is truly probabilistic and can thus be physically interpreted
and be used in a Bayesian framework. For the ﬁrst time, it was shown that generating dynamical
trajectories in a 30-dimensional molecular conﬁguration space results in sampling of physically
realistic molecular structures. While Alanine dipeptide is a small system compared to proteins and
other macromolecules that are of biological interest, our results demonstrate that efﬁcient sampling
of new molecular structures is possible with generative dynamic models, and improved methods
can be built upon this. Future methods will especially need to address the difﬁculties of generating
valid conﬁgurations in low-probability regimes, and it is likely that the energy distance used here
for generator training needs to be revisited to achieve this goal.

Analysis of transition matrices

The transition matrix K(τ ) = [kij(τ )] ∈ Rm×m is deﬁned as

kij(τ ) = P(xt+τ ∈ state j|xt ∈ state i).

Then, according to (1), we have

kij(τ ) =

P(xt+τ = y|xt ∈ state i) · P(xt+τ ∈ state j|xt+τ = y)dy

(cid:90)

(cid:90)

=

qi(y; τ )χj(y) dy,

and

If χ, q satisfy the conditions

kij(nτ ) = [K(τ )n]ij .

χi(x) ≥ 0, (cid:80)
j χj(x) = 1,
qi(x; τ ) ≥ 0, (cid:82) qi(y; τ )dy = 1, ∀x, i,
j kij(τ ) = 1, i.e., K(τ ) computed from χ, q is a valid transition

we have kij(τ ) ≥ 0 and (cid:80)
probability matrix.

For the distribution µ deﬁned in (4),

(cid:90)

(cid:90)

P(xt+τ = y|xt = x) · µ(x)dx =

= µ(y),

which shows µ is the stationary distribution of model (1).

VAMP-E training of deep MSMs

An alternative to ML training is to employ a score from the Variational Approach of Markov Pro-
cesses (VAMP) [31]. The VAMP-E score has the advantage over other VAMP scores employed
previously [15] that we do not have to specify the rank of the model [31]. The VAMP-E score is
computed as

RE = tr

(cid:16)

2C01 ¯Γ−1 − C00 ¯Γ−1C11 ¯Γ−1(cid:17)

(14)

which depends on covariance matrices estimated from the transformed data:

[C00]ij = Et[χi(xt)χj(xt)]
[C11]ij = Et[γi(xt+τ )γj(xt+τ )]
[C01]ij = Et[χi(xt)γj(xt+τ )]
¯Γ = diag(¯γ1, . . . , ¯γm).
We can use the standard empirical estimators to compute Et. We can then train a deep MSM using
the structure shown in Fig. 1 by maximizing (14).

Using the Energy Distance to train generative networks

The Energy Distance (ED) [28] is a metric that measures the difference between the distributions of
two real valued random vectors x and y, and is deﬁned as

DE(P(x), P(y)) = E [2 (cid:107)x − y(cid:107) − (cid:107)x − x(cid:48)(cid:107) − (cid:107)y − y(cid:48)(cid:107)] .
(15)
Here, x(cid:48), y(cid:48) are independently distributed according to the distributions of y, z. Therefore, the con-
ditional energy distance given in (12) is equal to the mean value of the energy distance between the

11

conditional distributions P(xt+τ |xt) and P(ˆxt+τ |xt) for all xt, and satisﬁes that D ≥ 0 and D = 0
if and only if P(xt+τ |xt) = P(ˆxt+τ |xt) for all xt.
Noticing that E (cid:2)(cid:13)

Motivation of Energy Distance as the training metric

The major advantages of ED are:

1. It can be unbiasedly estimated from the data without an extra “adversarial” network as in

GANs.

2. Unlike the KL divergence (see example 1 in [1]), ED does not diverge in the case of few

data points (small batch sizes) or low populated probability density areas.

3. As a speciﬁc Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD), ED can avoid the problem of popular
kernel-MMDs that the gradients of cost functions are vanished if the generated samples
are far away from the training data, and therefore achieve higher efﬁciency when learning
generative models.

Network architecture and training procedure

All neural networks representing the functions χ, γ and G for the Prinz potential are using 64
nodes in all 4 hidden layers and batch normalization after each layer [9]. Rectiﬁed linear activation
functions (ReLUs) are used, except for the output layer of χ which uses SoftMax and the output
layer of G which has a linear activation function. Both χ and γ have 4 output nodes, and G receives
a four-dimensional 1-hot-encoding of the metastable state plus a four-dimensional noise vector as
inputs. Optimization is done using Adam [10], with early stopping checking if the validation score
is not increasing over 5 epochs. The learning rate for the training of χ, γ is λ = 10−3, and for G
λ = 10−5 with a batchsize of 100. We are using a time-lag of τ = 5 frames.

For alanine dipeptide, χ and γ consist both of 3 residual blocks [7] built of 3 layers all having 100
nodes, with exponential linear units (ELUs) [5], and batch normalization for each layer. The output
layer has 6 output nodes, where χ uses a softmax activation function and γ a RELU, respectively.
In order to ﬁnd all slow processes, it was necessary to pre-train χ with the VAMPnet method [15].
The generator G uses 6 noise inputs and a six-dimensional 1-hot-encoding of the metastable state
and the ML-ED scheme. Networks are trained with Adam until the validation score converges with
a learning rate of λ = 10−5 for χ, γ using 8000 as batchsize and λ = 10−4 for G using 1500 frames
for a batch. All subsequent analyses that use a ﬁxed lag time employ τ = 1 ps.

For ﬁnding the hyperparameter we performed a restricted grid search, which showed comparing the
KL divergence between the modeled distributions that the result does only marginally depend on the
choice of the parameters (see 1 for an example).

Abstract

We propose a deep generative Markov State Model (DeepGenMSM) learning
framework for inference of metastable dynamical systems and prediction of tra-
jectories. After unsupervised training on time series data, the model contains (i)
a probabilistic encoder that maps from high-dimensional conﬁguration space to a
small-sized vector indicating the membership to metastable (long-lived) states, (ii)
a Markov chain that governs the transitions between metastable states and facili-
tates analysis of the long-time dynamics, and (iii) a generative part that samples
the conditional distribution of conﬁgurations in the next time step. The model
can be operated in a recursive fashion to generate trajectories to predict the sys-
tem evolution from a deﬁned starting state and propose new conﬁgurations. The
DeepGenMSM is demonstrated to provide accurate estimates of the long-time ki-
netics and generate valid distributions for molecular dynamics (MD) benchmark
systems. Remarkably, we show that DeepGenMSMs are able to make long time-
steps in molecular conﬁguration space and generate physically realistic structures
in regions that were not seen in training data.

Introduction

Complex dynamical systems that exhibit events on vastly different timescales are ubiquitous in sci-
ence and engineering. For example, molecular dynamics (MD) of biomolecules involve fast vibra-
tions on the timescales of 10−15 seconds, while their biological function is often related to the rare
switching events between long-lived states on timescales of 10−3 seconds or longer. In weather and
climate systems, local ﬂuctuations in temperature and pressure ﬁelds occur within minutes or hours,
while global changes are often subject to periodic motion and drift over years or decades. Primary
goals in the analysis of complex dynamical systems include:

1. Deriving an interpretable model of the essential long-time dynamical properties of these

systems, such as the stationary behavior or lifetimes/cycle times of slow processes.

2. Simulating the dynamical system, e.g., to predict the system’s future evolution or to sample

previously unobserved system conﬁgurations.

A state-of-the-art approach for the ﬁrst goal is to learn a Markovian model from time-series data,
which is theoretically justiﬁed by the fact that physical systems are inherently Markovian. In prac-
tice, the long-time behavior of dynamical systems can be accurately described in a Markovian model
when suitable features or variables are used, and when the time resolution of the model is sufﬁciently
coarse such that the time-evolution can be represented with a manageable number of dynamical
modes [25, 11]. In stochastic dynamical systems, such as MD simulation, variants of Markov state
models (MSMs) are commonly used [3, 24, 22]. In MSMs, the conﬁguration space is discretized,
e.g., using a clustering method, and the dynamics between clusters are then described by a matrix

of transition probabilities [22]. The analogous approach for deterministic dynamical systems such
as complex ﬂuid ﬂows is called Koopman analysis, where time propagation is approximated by a
linear model in a suitable function space transformation of the ﬂow variables [16, 26, 29, 4]. The
recently proposed VAMPnets learn an optimal feature transformation from full conﬁguration space
to a low-dimensional latent space in which the Markovian model is built by variational optimization
of a neural network [15]. When the VAMPnet has a probabilistic output (e.g. SoftMax layer), the
Markovian model conserves probability, but is not guaranteed to be a valid transition probability
matrix with nonnegative elements. A related work for deterministic dynamical systems is Extended
Dynamic Mode Decomposition with dictionary learning [13]. All of these methods are purely ana-
lytic, i.e. they learn a reduced model of the dynamical system underlying the observed time series,
but they miss a generative part that could be used to sample new time series in the high-dimensional
conﬁguration space.

Recently, several learning frameworks for dynamical systems have been proposed that partially ad-
dress the second goal by including a decoder from the latent space back to the space of input features.
Most of these methods primarily aim at obtaining a low-dimensional latent space that encodes the
long-time behavior of the system, and the decoder takes the role of deﬁning or regularizing the learn-
ing problem [30, 8, 14, 19, 23]. In particular none of these models have demonstrated the ability to
generate viable structures in the high-dimensional conﬁguration space, such as a molecular struc-
ture with realistic atom positions in 3D. Finally, some of these models learn a linear model of the
long-timescale dynamics [14, 19], but none of them provide a probabilistic dynamical model that
can be employed in a Bayesian framework. Learning the correct long-time dynamical behavior with
a generative dynamical model is difﬁcult, as demonstrated in [8].

Here, we address these aforementioned gaps by providing a deep learning framework that learns,
based on time-series data, the following components:

1. Probabilistic encodings of the input conﬁguration to a low-dimensional latent space by

neural networks, xt → χ(xt).

2. A true transition probability matrix K describing the system dynamics in latent space for a

ﬁxed time-lag τ :

E [χ(xt+τ )] = E (cid:2)K(cid:62)(τ )χ(xt)(cid:3) .
The probabilistic nature of the method allows us to train it with likelihood maximization
and embed it into a Bayesian framework. In our benchmarks, the transition probability
matrix approximates the long-time behavior of the underlying dynamical system with high
accuracy.

3. A generative model from latent vectors back to conﬁgurations, allowing us to sample the
transition density P(xt+τ |xt) and thus propagate the model in conﬁguration space. We
show for the ﬁrst time that this allows us to sample genuinely new and valid molecular
structures that have not been included in the training data. This makes the method promis-
ing for performing active learning in MD [2, 21], and to predict the future evolution of the
system in other contexts.

2 Deep Generative Markov State Models

Given two conﬁgurations x, y ∈ Rd, where Rd is a potentially high-dimensional space of system
conﬁgurations (e.g. the positions of atoms in a molecular system), Markovian dynamics are deﬁned
by the transition density P(xt+τ = y|xt = x). Here we represent the transition density between m
states in the following form (Fig. 1):

P(xt+τ = y|xt = x) = χ(x)(cid:62)q(y; τ ) =

χi(x)qi(y; τ ).

(1)

m
(cid:88)

i=1

Here, χ(x)(cid:62) = [χ1(x), ..., χm(x)] represent the probability of conﬁguration x to be in a metastable
(long-lived) state i

Consequently, these functions are nonnegative (χi(x) ≥ 0∀x) and sum up to one ((cid:80)
i χi(x) = 1∀x).
The functions χ(x) can, e.g., be represented by a neural network mapping from Rd to Rm with a

χi(x) = P(xt ∈ state i | xt = x).

Figure 1: Schematic of Deep Generative Markov State Models (DeepGenMSMs) and the rewiring
trick. The function χ, here represented by neural networks, maps the time-lagged input conﬁgura-
tions to metastable states whose dynamics are governed by a transition probability matrix K. The
generator samples the distribution xt+τ ∼ q by employing a generative network that can produce
novel conﬁgurations (or by resampling xt+τ in DeepResampleMSMs). The rewiring trick consists
of reconnecting the probabilistic networks q and χ such that the time propagation in latent space
can be sampled: From the latent state χ(xt), we generate a time-lagged conﬁguration xt+τ using
q, and then transform it back to the latent space, χ(xt+τ ). Each application of the rewired net-
work samples the latent space transitions, thus providing the statistics to estimate the Markov model
transition matrix K(τ ), which is needed for analysis. This trick allows K(τ ) to be estimated with
desired constraints, such as detailed balance.

SoftMax output layer. Additionally, we have the probability densities
qi(y; τ ) = P(xt+τ = y|xt ∈ state i)
that deﬁne the probability density of the system to “land” at conﬁguration y after making one time-
step. We thus brieﬂy call them “landing densities”.

2.1 Kinetics

Before addressing how to estimate χ and q from data, we describe how to perform the standard
calculations and analyses that are common in the Markov modeling ﬁeld for a model of the form
(1).

In Markov modeling, one is typically interested in the kinetics of the system, i.e.
the long-time
behavior of the dynamics. This is captured by the elements of the transition matrix K = [kij]
between metastable states. K can be computed as follows: the product of the probability density
to jump from metastable i to a conﬁguration y and the probability that this conﬁguration belongs to
metastable state j, integrated over the whole conﬁguration space.

kij(τ ) =

qi(y; τ )χj(y) dy.

(2)

(cid:90)

y

Practically, this calculation is implemented via the “rewiring trick” shown in Fig. 1, where the
conﬁguration space integral is approximated by drawing samples from the generator. The estimated
probabilistic functions q and χ deﬁne, by construction, a valid transition probability matrix K,
i.e. kij ≥ 0 and (cid:80)
j kij = 1. As a result, the proposed models have a structural advantage over
other high-accuracy Markov state modeling approaches that deﬁne metastable states in a fuzzy or
probabilistic manner but do not guarantee a valid transition matrix [12, 15] (See Supplementary
Material for more details.).

The stationary (equilibrium) probabilities of the metastable states are given by the vector π = [πi]
that solves the eigenvalue problem with eigenvalue λ1 = 1:

and the stationary (equilibrium) distribution in conﬁguration space is given by:

π = K(cid:62)π,

µ(y) =

πiqi(y; τ ) = π(cid:62)q(y; τ ).

(cid:88)

i

Finally, for a ﬁxed deﬁnition of states via χ, the self-consistency of Markov models may be tested
using the Chapman-Kolmogorov equation

which involves estimating the functions q(y; nτ ) at different lag times nτ and comparing the re-
sulting transition matrices with the nth power of the transition matrix obtained at lag time τ . A
consequence of Eq. (5) is that the relaxation times

ti(τ ) = −

τ
log |λi(τ )|

are independent of the lag time τ at which K is estimated [27]. Here, λi with i = 2, ..., m are the
nontrivial eigenvalues of K.

2.2 Maximum Likelihood (ML) learning of DeepResampleMSM

Given trajectories {xt}t=1,...,T , how do we estimate the membership probabilities χ(x), and how
do we learn and sample the landing densities q(y)? We start with a model, where q(y) are di-
rectly derived from the observed (empirical) observations, i.e. they are point densities on the input
conﬁgurations {xt}, given by:

1
¯γi
Here, ρ(y) is the empirical distribution, which in the case of ﬁnite sample size is simply ρ(y) =
t=1 δ(y − xt+τ ), and γi(y) is a trainable weighting function. The normalization factor

γi(y)ρ(y).

qi(y) =

(cid:80)T −τ

(cid:80)T −τ

t=1 γi(xt+τ ) = Ey∼ρ1[γi(y)] ensures (cid:82)

¯γi = 1
T −τ

Now we can optimize χi and γi by maximizing the likelihood (ML) of generating the pairs
(xt, xt+τ ) observed in the data. The log-likelihood is given by:

and is maximized to train a deep MSM with the structure shown in Fig. 1.

i=1

Alternatively, we can optimize χi and γi using the Variational Approach for Markov Processes
(VAMP) [31]. However, we found the ML approach to perform signiﬁcantly better in our tests, and
we thus include the VAMP training approach only in the Supplementary Material without elaborat-
ing on it further.

Given the networks χ and γ, we compute q from Eq. (7). Employing the rewiring trick shown in
Fig. 1 results in computing the transition matrix by a simple average over all conﬁgurations:

The deep MSMs described in this section are neural network generalizations of traditional MSMs
– they learn a mapping from conﬁgurations to metastable states, where they aim obtaining a good
approximation of the kinetics of the underlying dynamical system, by means of the transition matrix
K. However, since the landing distribution q in these methods is derived from the empirical distribu-
tion (7), any generated trajectory will only resample conﬁgurations from the input data. To highlight
this property, we will refer to the deep MSMs with the present methodology as DeepResampleMSM.

2.3 Energy Distance learning of DeepGenMSM

In contrast to DeepResampleMSM, we now want to learn deep generative MSM (DeepGenMSM),
which can be used to generate trajectories that do not only resample from input data, but can produce
genuinely new conﬁgurations. To this end, we train a generative model to mimic the empirical
distribution qi(y):

y = G(ei, (cid:15)),
(10)
where the vector ei ∈ Rm is a one-hot encoding of the metastable state, and (cid:15) is a i.i.d. random
vector where each component samples from a Gaussian normal distribution.

Here we train the generator G by minimizing the conditional Energy Distance (ED), whose choice is
motivated in the Supplementary Material. The standard ED, introduced in [28], is a metric between
the distributions of random vectors, deﬁned as

DE (P(x), P(y)) = E [2 (cid:107)x − y(cid:107) − (cid:107)x − x(cid:48)(cid:107) − (cid:107)y − y(cid:48)(cid:107)]

(11)

for two real-valued random variables x and y. x, x(cid:48), y, y(cid:48) are independently distributed according to
the distributions of x, y. Based on this metric, we introduce the conditional energy distance between
the transition density of the system and that of the generative model:

D (cid:44) E [DE (P(xt+τ |xt), P(ˆxt+τ |xt)) |xt]

= E (cid:2)2 (cid:107)ˆxt+τ − xt+τ (cid:107) − (cid:13)

(cid:13)ˆxt+τ − ˆx(cid:48)

t+τ

(cid:13)

(cid:13)xt+τ − x(cid:48)

t+τ

(cid:13)
(cid:3)
(cid:13)

(12)

t+τ are distributed according to the transition density for given xt and ˆxt+τ , ˆx(cid:48)

Here xt+τ and x(cid:48)
t+τ
are independent outputs of the generative model conditioned on xt. Implementing the expectation
value with an empirical average results in an estimate for D that is unbiased, up to an additive
constant. We train G to minimize D. See Supplementary Material for detailed derivations and the
training algorithm used.

After training, the transition matrix can be obtained by using the rewiring trick (Fig. 1), where the
conﬁguration space integral is sampled by generating samples from the generator:

[K]ij = E(cid:15) [χj (G(ei, (cid:15)))] .

(13)

3 Results

Below we establish our framework by applying it to two well-deﬁned benchmark systems that ex-
hibit metastable stochastic dynamics. We validate the stationary distribution and kinetics by comput-
ing χ(x), q(y), the stationary distribution µ(y) and the relaxation times ti(τ ) and comparing them
with reference solutions. We will also test the abilities of DeepGenMSMs to generate physically
valid molecular conﬁgurations.

The networks were implemented using PyTorch [20] and Tensorﬂow [6]. For the full code and all
details about the neural network architecture, hyper-parameters and training algorithm, please refer

3.1 Diffusion in Prinz potential

We ﬁrst apply our framework to the time-discretized diffusion process xt+∆t = −∆t ∇V (xt) +
√
2∆t ˙ηt with ∆t = 0.01 in the Prinz potential V (xt) introduced in [22] (Fig. 2a). For this system
we know exact results for benchmarking: the stationary distribution and relaxation timescales (black
lines in Fig. 2b,c) and the transition density (Fig. 2d). We simulate trajectories of lengths 250, 000
and 125, 000 time steps for training and validation, respectively. For all methods, we repeat the data
generation and model estimation process 10 times and compute mean and standard deviations for
all quantities of interest, which thus represent the mean and variance of the estimators.

The functions χ, γ and G are represented with densely connected neural networks. The details of
the architecture and the training procedure can be found in the Supplementary Information.

We compare DeepResampleMSMs and DeepGenMSMs with standard MSMs using four or ten
states obtained with k-means clustering. Note that standard MSMs do not directly operate on con-
ﬁguration space. When using an MSM, the transition density (Eq. 1) is thus simulated by:

∼Ki,∗−→ j
i.e., we ﬁnd the cluster i associated with a conﬁguration xt, which is deterministic for regular MSMs,
then sample the cluster j at the next time-step, and sample from the conditional distribution of
conﬁgurations in cluster j to generate xt+τ .

∼ρj (y)
−→ xt+τ ,

χ(xt)
−→ i

xt

Both DeepResampleMSMs trained with the ML method and standard MSMs can reproduce the
stationary distribution within statistical uncertainty (Fig. 2b). For long lag times τ , all methods con-
verge from below to the correct relaxation timescales (Fig. 2c), as expected from theory [22, 18].
When using equally many states (here: four), the DeepResampleMSM has a much lower bias in the
relaxation timescales than the standard MSM. This is expected from approximation theory, as the
DeepResampleMSMs represents the four metastable states with a meaningful, smooth membership
functions χ(xt), while the four-state MSM cuts the memberships hard at boundaries with low sam-
ple density (Supplementary Fig. 1). When increasing the number of metastable states, the bias of
all estimators will reduce. An MSM with ten states is needed to perform approximately equal to a
four-state DeepResampleMSM (Fig. 2c). All subsequent analyses use a lag time of τ = 5.

ML-ED training. (a) Stationary distribution. (b-d) Transition densities. (e) Relaxation timescales.

The DeepResampleMSM generates a transition density that is very similar to the exact density,
while the MSM transition densities are coarse-grained by virtue of the fact that χ(xt) performs a
hard clustering in an MSM (Fig. 2d). This impression is conﬁrmed when computing the Kullback-
Leibler divergence of the distributions (Fig. 2e).

Encouraged by the accurate results of DeepResampleMSMs, we now train DeepGenMSM, either
by training both the χ and q networks by minimizing the energy distance (ED), or by taking χ
from a ML-trained DeepResampleMSM and only training the q network by minimizing the energy
distance (ML-ED). The stationary densities, relaxation timescales and transition densities can still
be approximated in these settings, although the DeepGenMSMs exhibit larger statistical ﬂuctuations
than the resampling MSMs (Fig. 3). ML-ED appears to perform slightly better than ED alone, likely
because reusing χ from the ML training makes the problem of training the generator easier.

For a one-dimensional example like the Prinz potential, learning a generative model does not provide
any added value, as the distributions can be well approximated by the empirical distributions. The
fact that we can still get approximately correct results for stationary, kinetics and dynamical proper-
ties encourages us to use DeepGenMSMs for a higher-dimensional example, where the generation
of conﬁgurations is a hard problem.

3.2 Alanine dipeptide

We use explicit-solvent MD simulations of Alanine dipeptide as a second example. Our aim is
the learn stationary and kinetic properties, but especially to learn a generative model that generates
genuinely novel but physically meaningful conﬁgurations. One 250 ns trajectory with a storage
interval of 1 ps is used and split 80%/20% for training and validation – see [15] for details of the
simulation setup. We characterize all structures by the three-dimensional Cartesian coordinates of
the heavy atoms, resulting in a 30 dimensional conﬁguration space. While we do not have exact
results for Alanine dipeptide, the system is small enough and well enough sampled, such that high-

pleMSM (c) Relaxation timescales.

quality estimates of stationary and kinetic properties can be obtained from a very ﬁne MSM [22].
We therefore deﬁne an MSM build on 400 equally sized grid areas in the (φ, ψ)-plane as a reference
at a lag time of τ = 25 ps that has been validated by established methods [22].

Neural network and training details are again found at the git repository and in the Supplementary
Information.

For comparison with deep MSMs, we build two standard MSMs following a state of the art protocol:
we transform input conﬁgurations with a kinetic map preserving 95% of the cumulative kinetic
variance [17], followed by k-means clustering, where k = 6 and k = 100 are used.

DeepResampleMSM trained with ML method approximate the stationary distribution very well (Fig.
4a). The reference MSM assigns a slightly lower weight to the lowest-populated state 6, but other-
wise the data, reference distribution and deep MSM distribution are visually indistinguishable. The
relaxation timescales estimated by a six-state DeepResampleMSM are signiﬁcantly better than with
six-state standard MSMs. MSMs with 100 states have a similar performance as the deep MSMs but
this comes at the cost of a model with a much larger latent space.

Finally, we test DeepGenMSMs for Alanine dipeptide where χ is trained with the ML method and
the generator is then trained using ED (ML-ED). The stationary distribution generated by simulat-
ing the DeepGenMSM recursively results in a stationary distribution which is very similar to the
reference distribution in states 1-4 with small φ values (Fig. 4a). States number 5 and 6 with large
φ values are captured, but their shapes and weights are somewhat distorted (Fig. 4a). The one-step
transition densities predicted by the generator are high quality for all states (Suppl. Fig. 2), thus
the differences observed for the stationary distribution must come from small errors made in the
transitions between metastable states that are very rarely observed for states 5 and 6. These rare
events result in poor training data for the generator. However, the DeepGenMSMs approximates the
kinetics well within the uncertainty that is mostly due to estimator variance (Fig. 4c).

Now we ask whether DeepGenMSMs can sample valid structures in the 30-dimensional conﬁgura-
tion space, i.e., if the placement of atoms is physically meaningful. As we generate conﬁgurations
in Cartesian space, we ﬁrst check if the internal coordinates are physically viable by comparing
all bond lengths and angles between real MD data and generated trajectories (Fig. 5). The true
bond lengths and angles are almost perfectly Gaussian distributed, and we thus normalize them by
shifting each distribution to a mean of 0 and scaling it to have standard deviation 1, which results
all reference distributions to collapse to a normal distribution (Fig. 5a,c). We normalize the gener-
ated distribution with the mean and standard distribution of the true data. Although there are clear
differences (Fig. 5b,d), these distributions are very encouraging. Bonds and angles are very stiff de-
grees of freedom, and the fact that most differences in mean and standard deviation are small when
compared to the true ﬂuctuation width means that the generated structures are close to physically
accurate and could be reﬁned by little additional MD simulation effort.

Finally, we perform an experiment to test whether the DeepGenMSM is able to generate genuinely
new conﬁgurations that do exist for Alanine dipeptide but have not been seen in the training data. In
other words, can the generator “extrapolate” in a meaningful way? This is a fundamental question,
because simulating MD is exorbitantly expensive, with each simulation time step being computation-
ally expensive but progressing time only of the order of 10−15 seconds, while often total simulation

timescales of 10−3 seconds or longer are needed. A DeepGenMSM that makes leaps of length τ
– orders of magnitude larger than the MD simulation time-step – and has even a small chance of
generating new and meaningful structures would be extremely valuable to discover new states and
thereby accelerate MD sampling.

To test this ability, we conduct six experiments, in each of which we remove all data belonging to one
of the six metastable states of Alanine dipeptide (6a). We train a DeepGenMSM with each of these
datasets separately, and simulate it to predict the stationary distribution (6b). While the generated
stationary distributions are skewed and the shape of the distribution in the (φ, ψ) range with missing-
data are not quantitatively predicted, the DeepGenMSMs do indeed predict conﬁgurations where no
training data was present (6b). Surprisingly, the quality of most of these conﬁgurations is high (6c).
While the structures of the two low-populated states 5-6 do not look realistic, each of the metastable
states 1-4 are generated with high quality, as shown by the overlap of a real MD structure and the
100 most similar generated structures (6c).

In conclusion, deep MSMs provide high-quality models of the stationary and kinetic properties for
stochastic dynamical systems such as MD simulations.
In contrast to other high-quality models
such as VAMPnets, the resulting model is truly probabilistic and can thus be physically interpreted
and be used in a Bayesian framework. For the ﬁrst time, it was shown that generating dynamical
trajectories in a 30-dimensional molecular conﬁguration space results in sampling of physically
realistic molecular structures. While Alanine dipeptide is a small system compared to proteins and
other macromolecules that are of biological interest, our results demonstrate that efﬁcient sampling
of new molecular structures is possible with generative dynamic models, and improved methods
can be built upon this. Future methods will especially need to address the difﬁculties of generating
valid conﬁgurations in low-probability regimes, and it is likely that the energy distance used here
for generator training needs to be revisited to achieve this goal.

Analysis of transition matrices

The transition matrix K(τ ) = [kij(τ )] ∈ Rm×m is deﬁned as

kij(τ ) = P(xt+τ ∈ state j|xt ∈ state i).

Then, according to (1), we have

kij(τ ) =

P(xt+τ = y|xt ∈ state i) · P(xt+τ ∈ state j|xt+τ = y)dy

(cid:90)

(cid:90)

=

qi(y; τ )χj(y) dy,

and

If χ, q satisfy the conditions

kij(nτ ) = [K(τ )n]ij .

χi(x) ≥ 0, (cid:80)
j χj(x) = 1,
qi(x; τ ) ≥ 0, (cid:82) qi(y; τ )dy = 1, ∀x, i,
j kij(τ ) = 1, i.e., K(τ ) computed from χ, q is a valid transition

we have kij(τ ) ≥ 0 and (cid:80)

which shows µ is the stationary distribution of model (1).

VAMP-E training of deep MSMs

An alternative to ML training is to employ a score from the Variational Approach of Markov Pro-
cesses (VAMP) [31]. The VAMP-E score has the advantage over other VAMP scores employed
previously [15] that we do not have to specify the rank of the model [31]. The VAMP-E score is
computed as

RE = tr

(cid:16)

2C01 ¯Γ−1 − C00 ¯Γ−1C11 ¯Γ−1(cid:17)

(14)

which depends on covariance matrices estimated from the transformed data:

[C00]ij = Et[χi(xt)χj(xt)]
[C11]ij = Et[γi(xt+τ )γj(xt+τ )]
[C01]ij = Et[χi(xt)γj(xt+τ )]
¯Γ = diag(¯γ1, . . . , ¯γm).
We can use the standard empirical estimators to compute Et. We can then train a deep MSM using
the structure shown in Fig. 1 by maximizing (14).

Using the Energy Distance to train generative networks

The Energy Distance (ED) [28] is a metric that measures the difference between the distributions of
two real valued random vectors x and y, and is deﬁned as

DE(P(x), P(y)) = E [2 (cid:107)x − y(cid:107) − (cid:107)x − x(cid:48)(cid:107) − (cid:107)y − y(cid:48)(cid:107)] .
(15)
Here, x(cid:48), y(cid:48) are independently distributed according to the distributions of y, z. Therefore, the con-
ditional energy distance given in (12) is equal to the mean value of the energy distance between the

11

conditional distributions P(xt+τ |xt) and P(ˆxt+τ |xt) for all xt, and satisﬁes that D ≥ 0 and D = 0
if and only if P(xt+τ |xt) = P(ˆxt+τ |xt) for all xt.
Noticing that E (cid:2)(cid:13)

Motivation of Energy Distance as the training metric

The major advantages of ED are:

1. It can be unbiasedly estimated from the data without an extra “adversarial” network as in

GANs.

2. Unlike the KL divergence (see example 1 in [1]), ED does not diverge in the case of few

data points (small batch sizes) or low populated probability density areas.

3. As a speciﬁc Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD), ED can avoid the problem of popular
kernel-MMDs that the gradients of cost functions are vanished if the generated samples
are far away from the training data, and therefore achieve higher efﬁciency when learning
generative models.

Network architecture and training procedure

All neural networks representing the functions χ, γ and G for the Prinz potential are using 64
nodes in all 4 hidden layers and batch normalization after each layer [9]. Rectiﬁed linear activation
functions (ReLUs) are used, except for the output layer of χ which uses SoftMax and the output
layer of G which has a linear activation function. Both χ and γ have 4 output nodes, and G receives
a four-dimensional 1-hot-encoding of the metastable state plus a four-dimensional noise vector as
inputs. Optimization is done using Adam [10], with early stopping checking if the validation score
is not increasing over 5 epochs. The learning rate for the training of χ, γ is λ = 10−3, and for G
λ = 10−5 with a batchsize of 100. We are using a time-lag of τ = 5 frames.

For alanine dipeptide, χ and γ consist both of 3 residual blocks [7] built of 3 layers all having 100
nodes, with exponential linear units (ELUs) [5], and batch normalization for each layer. The output
layer has 6 output nodes, where χ uses a softmax activation function and γ a RELU, respectively.
In order to ﬁnd all slow processes, it was necessary to pre-train χ with the VAMPnet method [15].
The generator G uses 6 noise inputs and a six-dimensional 1-hot-encoding of the metastable state
and the ML-ED scheme. Networks are trained with Adam until the validation score converges with
a learning rate of λ = 10−5 for χ, γ using 8000 as batchsize and λ = 10−4 for G using 1500 frames
for a batch. All subsequent analyses that use a ﬁxed lag time employ τ = 1 ps.

For ﬁnding the hyperparameter we performed a restricted grid search, which showed comparing the
KL divergence between the modeled distributions that the result does only marginally depend on the
choice of the parameters (see 1 for an example).

Abstract

We propose a deep generative Markov State Model (DeepGenMSM) learning
framework for inference of metastable dynamical systems and prediction of tra-
jectories. After unsupervised training on time series data, the model contains (i)
a probabilistic encoder that maps from high-dimensional conﬁguration space to a
small-sized vector indicating the membership to metastable (long-lived) states, (ii)
a Markov chain that governs the transitions between metastable states and facili-
tates analysis of the long-time dynamics, and (iii) a generative part that samples
the conditional distribution of conﬁgurations in the next time step. The model
can be operated in a recursive fashion to generate trajectories to predict the sys-
tem evolution from a deﬁned starting state and propose new conﬁgurations. The
DeepGenMSM is demonstrated to provide accurate estimates of the long-time ki-
netics and generate valid distributions for molecular dynamics (MD) benchmark
systems. Remarkably, we show that DeepGenMSMs are able to make long time-
steps in molecular conﬁguration space and generate physically realistic structures
in regions that were not seen in training data.

Introduction

Complex dynamical systems that exhibit events on vastly different timescales are ubiquitous in sci-
ence and engineering. For example, molecular dynamics (MD) of biomolecules involve fast vibra-
tions on the timescales of 10−15 seconds, while their biological function is often related to the rare
switching events between long-lived states on timescales of 10−3 seconds or longer. In weather and
climate systems, local ﬂuctuations in temperature and pressure ﬁelds occur within minutes or hours,
while global changes are often subject to periodic motion and drift over years or decades. Primary
goals in the analysis of complex dynamical systems include:

1. Deriving an interpretable model of the essential long-time dynamical properties of these

systems, such as the stationary behavior or lifetimes/cycle times of slow processes.

2. Simulating the dynamical system, e.g., to predict the system’s future evolution or to sample

previously unobserved system conﬁgurations.

A state-of-the-art approach for the ﬁrst goal is to learn a Markovian model from time-series data,
which is theoretically justiﬁed by the fact that physical systems are inherently Markovian. In prac-
tice, the long-time behavior of dynamical systems can be accurately described in a Markovian model
when suitable features or variables are used, and when the time resolution of the model is sufﬁciently
coarse such that the time-evolution can be represented with a manageable number of dynamical
modes [25, 11]. In stochastic dynamical systems, such as MD simulation, variants of Markov state
models (MSMs) are commonly used [3, 24, 22]. In MSMs, the conﬁguration space is discretized,
e.g., using a clustering method, and the dynamics between clusters are then described by a matrix

of transition probabilities [22]. The analogous approach for deterministic dynamical systems such
as complex ﬂuid ﬂows is called Koopman analysis, where time propagation is approximated by a
linear model in a suitable function space transformation of the ﬂow variables [16, 26, 29, 4]. The
recently proposed VAMPnets learn an optimal feature transformation from full conﬁguration space
to a low-dimensional latent space in which the Markovian model is built by variational optimization
of a neural network [15]. When the VAMPnet has a probabilistic output (e.g. SoftMax layer), the
Markovian model conserves probability, but is not guaranteed to be a valid transition probability
matrix with nonnegative elements. A related work for deterministic dynamical systems is Extended
Dynamic Mode Decomposition with dictionary learning [13]. All of these methods are purely ana-
lytic, i.e. they learn a reduced model of the dynamical system underlying the observed time series,
but they miss a generative part that could be used to sample new time series in the high-dimensional
conﬁguration space.

Recently, several learning frameworks for dynamical systems have been proposed that partially ad-
dress the second goal by including a decoder from the latent space back to the space of input features.
Most of these methods primarily aim at obtaining a low-dimensional latent space that encodes the
long-time behavior of the system, and the decoder takes the role of deﬁning or regularizing the learn-
ing problem [30, 8, 14, 19, 23]. In particular none of these models have demonstrated the ability to
generate viable structures in the high-dimensional conﬁguration space, such as a molecular struc-
ture with realistic atom positions in 3D. Finally, some of these models learn a linear model of the
long-timescale dynamics [14, 19], but none of them provide a probabilistic dynamical model that
can be employed in a Bayesian framework. Learning the correct long-time dynamical behavior with
a generative dynamical model is difﬁcult, as demonstrated in [8].

Here, we address these aforementioned gaps by providing a deep learning framework that learns,
based on time-series data, the following components:

1. Probabilistic encodings of the input conﬁguration to a low-dimensional latent space by

neural networks, xt → χ(xt).

2. A true transition probability matrix K describing the system dynamics in latent space for a

ﬁxed time-lag τ :

E [χ(xt+τ )] = E (cid:2)K(cid:62)(τ )χ(xt)(cid:3) .
The probabilistic nature of the method allows us to train it with likelihood maximization
and embed it into a Bayesian framework. In our benchmarks, the transition probability
matrix approximates the long-time behavior of the underlying dynamical system with high
accuracy.

3. A generative model from latent vectors back to conﬁgurations, allowing us to sample the
transition density P(xt+τ |xt) and thus propagate the model in conﬁguration space. We
show for the ﬁrst time that this allows us to sample genuinely new and valid molecular
structures that have not been included in the training data. This makes the method promis-
ing for performing active learning in MD [2, 21], and to predict the future evolution of the
system in other contexts.

2 Deep Generative Markov State Models

Given two conﬁgurations x, y ∈ Rd, where Rd is a potentially high-dimensional space of system
conﬁgurations (e.g. the positions of atoms in a molecular system), Markovian dynamics are deﬁned
by the transition density P(xt+τ = y|xt = x). Here we represent the transition density between m
states in the following form (Fig. 1):

P(xt+τ = y|xt = x) = χ(x)(cid:62)q(y; τ ) =

χi(x)qi(y; τ ).

(1)

m
(cid:88)

i=1

Here, χ(x)(cid:62) = [χ1(x), ..., χm(x)] represent the probability of conﬁguration x to be in a metastable
(long-lived) state i

Consequently, these functions are nonnegative (χi(x) ≥ 0∀x) and sum up to one ((cid:80)
i χi(x) = 1∀x).
The functions χ(x) can, e.g., be represented by a neural network mapping from Rd to Rm with a

χi(x) = P(xt ∈ state i | xt = x).

Figure 1: Schematic of Deep Generative Markov State Models (DeepGenMSMs) and the rewiring
trick. The function χ, here represented by neural networks, maps the time-lagged input conﬁgura-
tions to metastable states whose dynamics are governed by a transition probability matrix K. The
generator samples the distribution xt+τ ∼ q by employing a generative network that can produce
novel conﬁgurations (or by resampling xt+τ in DeepResampleMSMs). The rewiring trick consists
of reconnecting the probabilistic networks q and χ such that the time propagation in latent space
can be sampled: From the latent state χ(xt), we generate a time-lagged conﬁguration xt+τ using
q, and then transform it back to the latent space, χ(xt+τ ). Each application of the rewired net-
work samples the latent space transitions, thus providing the statistics to estimate the Markov model
transition matrix K(τ ), which is needed for analysis. This trick allows K(τ ) to be estimated with
desired constraints, such as detailed balance.

SoftMax output layer. Additionally, we have the probability densities
qi(y; τ ) = P(xt+τ = y|xt ∈ state i)
that deﬁne the probability density of the system to “land” at conﬁguration y after making one time-
step. We thus brieﬂy call them “landing densities”.

2.1 Kinetics

Before addressing how to estimate χ and q from data, we describe how to perform the standard
calculations and analyses that are common in the Markov modeling ﬁeld for a model of the form
(1).

In Markov modeling, one is typically interested in the kinetics of the system, i.e.
the long-time
behavior of the dynamics. This is captured by the elements of the transition matrix K = [kij]
between metastable states. K can be computed as follows: the product of the probability density
to jump from metastable i to a conﬁguration y and the probability that this conﬁguration belongs to
metastable state j, integrated over the whole conﬁguration space.

kij(τ ) =

qi(y; τ )χj(y) dy.

(2)

(cid:90)

y

Practically, this calculation is implemented via the “rewiring trick” shown in Fig. 1, where the
conﬁguration space integral is approximated by drawing samples from the generator. The estimated
probabilistic functions q and χ deﬁne, by construction, a valid transition probability matrix K,
i.e. kij ≥ 0 and (cid:80)
j kij = 1. As a result, the proposed models have a structural advantage over
other high-accuracy Markov state modeling approaches that deﬁne metastable states in a fuzzy or
probabilistic manner but do not guarantee a valid transition matrix [12, 15] (See Supplementary
Material for more details.).

The stationary (equilibrium) probabilities of the metastable states are given by the vector π = [πi]
that solves the eigenvalue problem with eigenvalue λ1 = 1:

and the stationary (equilibrium) distribution in conﬁguration space is given by:

π = K(cid:62)π,

µ(y) =

πiqi(y; τ ) = π(cid:62)q(y; τ ).

(cid:88)

i

Finally, for a ﬁxed deﬁnition of states via χ, the self-consistency of Markov models may be tested
using the Chapman-Kolmogorov equation

Kn(τ ) ≈ K(nτ )

which involves estimating the functions q(y; nτ ) at different lag times nτ and comparing the re-
sulting transition matrices with the nth power of the transition matrix obtained at lag time τ . A
consequence of Eq. (5) is that the relaxation times

ti(τ ) = −

τ
log |λi(τ )|

are independent of the lag time τ at which K is estimated [27]. Here, λi with i = 2, ..., m are the
nontrivial eigenvalues of K.

2.2 Maximum Likelihood (ML) learning of DeepResampleMSM

Given trajectories {xt}t=1,...,T , how do we estimate the membership probabilities χ(x), and how
do we learn and sample the landing densities q(y)? We start with a model, where q(y) are di-
rectly derived from the observed (empirical) observations, i.e. they are point densities on the input
conﬁgurations {xt}, given by:

1
¯γi
Here, ρ(y) is the empirical distribution, which in the case of ﬁnite sample size is simply ρ(y) =
t=1 δ(y − xt+τ ), and γi(y) is a trainable weighting function. The normalization factor

γi(y)ρ(y).

qi(y) =

t=1 γi(xt+τ ) = Ey∼ρ1[γi(y)] ensures (cid:82)

y qi(y) dy = 1.

Now we can optimize χi and γi by maximizing the likelihood (ML) of generating the pairs
(xt, xt+τ ) observed in the data. The log-likelihood is given by:

and is maximized to train a deep MSM with the structure shown in Fig. 1.

i=1

Alternatively, we can optimize χi and γi using the Variational Approach for Markov Processes
(VAMP) [31]. However, we found the ML approach to perform signiﬁcantly better in our tests, and
we thus include the VAMP training approach only in the Supplementary Material without elaborat-
ing on it further.

Given the networks χ and γ, we compute q from Eq. (7). Employing the rewiring trick shown in
Fig. 1 results in computing the transition matrix by a simple average over all conﬁgurations:

The deep MSMs described in this section are neural network generalizations of traditional MSMs
– they learn a mapping from conﬁgurations to metastable states, where they aim obtaining a good
approximation of the kinetics of the underlying dynamical system, by means of the transition matrix
K. However, since the landing distribution q in these methods is derived from the empirical distribu-
tion (7), any generated trajectory will only resample conﬁgurations from the input data. To highlight
this property, we will refer to the deep MSMs with the present methodology as DeepResampleMSM.

2.3 Energy Distance learning of DeepGenMSM

In contrast to DeepResampleMSM, we now want to learn deep generative MSM (DeepGenMSM),
which can be used to generate trajectories that do not only resample from input data, but can produce
genuinely new conﬁgurations. To this end, we train a generative model to mimic the empirical
distribution qi(y):

y = G(ei, (cid:15)),
(10)
where the vector ei ∈ Rm is a one-hot encoding of the metastable state, and (cid:15) is a i.i.d. random
vector where each component samples from a Gaussian normal distribution.

Here we train the generator G by minimizing the conditional Energy Distance (ED), whose choice is
motivated in the Supplementary Material. The standard ED, introduced in [28], is a metric between
the distributions of random vectors, deﬁned as

DE (P(x), P(y)) = E [2 (cid:107)x − y(cid:107) − (cid:107)x − x(cid:48)(cid:107) − (cid:107)y − y(cid:48)(cid:107)]

(11)

4

for two real-valued random variables x and y. x, x(cid:48), y, y(cid:48) are independently distributed according to
the distributions of x, y. Based on this metric, we introduce the conditional energy distance between
the transition density of the system and that of the generative model:

D (cid:44) E [DE (P(xt+τ |xt), P(ˆxt+τ |xt)) |xt]

= E (cid:2)2 (cid:107)ˆxt+τ − xt+τ (cid:107) − (cid:13)

(cid:13)ˆxt+τ − ˆx(cid:48)

t+τ

(cid:13) − (cid:13)
(cid:13)

(cid:13)xt+τ − x(cid:48)

t+τ

(cid:13)
(cid:3)
(cid:13)

(12)

t+τ are distributed according to the transition density for given xt and ˆxt+τ , ˆx(cid:48)

Here xt+τ and x(cid:48)
t+τ
are independent outputs of the generative model conditioned on xt. Implementing the expectation
value with an empirical average results in an estimate for D that is unbiased, up to an additive
constant. We train G to minimize D. See Supplementary Material for detailed derivations and the
training algorithm used.

After training, the transition matrix can be obtained by using the rewiring trick (Fig. 1), where the
conﬁguration space integral is sampled by generating samples from the generator:

[K]ij = E(cid:15) [χj (G(ei, (cid:15)))] .

(13)

3 Results

Below we establish our framework by applying it to two well-deﬁned benchmark systems that ex-
hibit metastable stochastic dynamics. We validate the stationary distribution and kinetics by comput-
ing χ(x), q(y), the stationary distribution µ(y) and the relaxation times ti(τ ) and comparing them
with reference solutions. We will also test the abilities of DeepGenMSMs to generate physically
valid molecular conﬁgurations.

The networks were implemented using PyTorch [20] and Tensorﬂow [6]. For the full code and all
details about the neural network architecture, hyper-parameters and training algorithm, please refer

3.1 Diffusion in Prinz potential

We ﬁrst apply our framework to the time-discretized diffusion process xt+∆t = −∆t ∇V (xt) +
√
2∆t ˙ηt with ∆t = 0.01 in the Prinz potential V (xt) introduced in [22] (Fig. 2a). For this system
we know exact results for benchmarking: the stationary distribution and relaxation timescales (black
lines in Fig. 2b,c) and the transition density (Fig. 2d). We simulate trajectories of lengths 250, 000
and 125, 000 time steps for training and validation, respectively. For all methods, we repeat the data
generation and model estimation process 10 times and compute mean and standard deviations for
all quantities of interest, which thus represent the mean and variance of the estimators.

The functions χ, γ and G are represented with densely connected neural networks. The details of
the architecture and the training procedure can be found in the Supplementary Information.

We compare DeepResampleMSMs and DeepGenMSMs with standard MSMs using four or ten
states obtained with k-means clustering. Note that standard MSMs do not directly operate on con-
ﬁguration space. When using an MSM, the transition density (Eq. 1) is thus simulated by:

∼Ki,∗−→ j
i.e., we ﬁnd the cluster i associated with a conﬁguration xt, which is deterministic for regular MSMs,
then sample the cluster j at the next time-step, and sample from the conditional distribution of
conﬁgurations in cluster j to generate xt+τ .

∼ρj (y)
−→ xt+τ ,

χ(xt)
−→ i

Both DeepResampleMSMs trained with the ML method and standard MSMs can reproduce the
stationary distribution within statistical uncertainty (Fig. 2b). For long lag times τ , all methods con-
verge from below to the correct relaxation timescales (Fig. 2c), as expected from theory [22, 18].
When using equally many states (here: four), the DeepResampleMSM has a much lower bias in the
relaxation timescales than the standard MSM. This is expected from approximation theory, as the
DeepResampleMSMs represents the four metastable states with a meaningful, smooth membership
functions χ(xt), while the four-state MSM cuts the memberships hard at boundaries with low sam-
ple density (Supplementary Fig. 1). When increasing the number of metastable states, the bias of
all estimators will reduce. An MSM with ten states is needed to perform approximately equal to a
four-state DeepResampleMSM (Fig. 2c). All subsequent analyses use a lag time of τ = 5.

The DeepResampleMSM generates a transition density that is very similar to the exact density,
while the MSM transition densities are coarse-grained by virtue of the fact that χ(xt) performs a
hard clustering in an MSM (Fig. 2d). This impression is conﬁrmed when computing the Kullback-
Leibler divergence of the distributions (Fig. 2e).

Encouraged by the accurate results of DeepResampleMSMs, we now train DeepGenMSM, either
by training both the χ and q networks by minimizing the energy distance (ED), or by taking χ
from a ML-trained DeepResampleMSM and only training the q network by minimizing the energy
distance (ML-ED). The stationary densities, relaxation timescales and transition densities can still
be approximated in these settings, although the DeepGenMSMs exhibit larger statistical ﬂuctuations
than the resampling MSMs (Fig. 3). ML-ED appears to perform slightly better than ED alone, likely
because reusing χ from the ML training makes the problem of training the generator easier.

For a one-dimensional example like the Prinz potential, learning a generative model does not provide
any added value, as the distributions can be well approximated by the empirical distributions. The
fact that we can still get approximately correct results for stationary, kinetics and dynamical proper-
ties encourages us to use DeepGenMSMs for a higher-dimensional example, where the generation
of conﬁgurations is a hard problem.

3.2 Alanine dipeptide

We use explicit-solvent MD simulations of Alanine dipeptide as a second example. Our aim is
the learn stationary and kinetic properties, but especially to learn a generative model that generates
genuinely novel but physically meaningful conﬁgurations. One 250 ns trajectory with a storage
interval of 1 ps is used and split 80%/20% for training and validation – see [15] for details of the
simulation setup. We characterize all structures by the three-dimensional Cartesian coordinates of
the heavy atoms, resulting in a 30 dimensional conﬁguration space. While we do not have exact
results for Alanine dipeptide, the system is small enough and well enough sampled, such that high-

quality estimates of stationary and kinetic properties can be obtained from a very ﬁne MSM [22].
We therefore deﬁne an MSM build on 400 equally sized grid areas in the (φ, ψ)-plane as a reference
at a lag time of τ = 25 ps that has been validated by established methods [22].

Neural network and training details are again found at the git repository and in the Supplementary
Information.

For comparison with deep MSMs, we build two standard MSMs following a state of the art protocol:
we transform input conﬁgurations with a kinetic map preserving 95% of the cumulative kinetic
variance [17], followed by k-means clustering, where k = 6 and k = 100 are used.

DeepResampleMSM trained with ML method approximate the stationary distribution very well (Fig.
4a). The reference MSM assigns a slightly lower weight to the lowest-populated state 6, but other-
wise the data, reference distribution and deep MSM distribution are visually indistinguishable. The
relaxation timescales estimated by a six-state DeepResampleMSM are signiﬁcantly better than with
six-state standard MSMs. MSMs with 100 states have a similar performance as the deep MSMs but
this comes at the cost of a model with a much larger latent space.

Finally, we test DeepGenMSMs for Alanine dipeptide where χ is trained with the ML method and
the generator is then trained using ED (ML-ED). The stationary distribution generated by simulat-
ing the DeepGenMSM recursively results in a stationary distribution which is very similar to the
reference distribution in states 1-4 with small φ values (Fig. 4a). States number 5 and 6 with large
φ values are captured, but their shapes and weights are somewhat distorted (Fig. 4a). The one-step
transition densities predicted by the generator are high quality for all states (Suppl. Fig. 2), thus
the differences observed for the stationary distribution must come from small errors made in the
transitions between metastable states that are very rarely observed for states 5 and 6. These rare
events result in poor training data for the generator. However, the DeepGenMSMs approximates the
kinetics well within the uncertainty that is mostly due to estimator variance (Fig. 4c).

Now we ask whether DeepGenMSMs can sample valid structures in the 30-dimensional conﬁgura-
tion space, i.e., if the placement of atoms is physically meaningful. As we generate conﬁgurations
in Cartesian space, we ﬁrst check if the internal coordinates are physically viable by comparing
all bond lengths and angles between real MD data and generated trajectories (Fig. 5). The true
bond lengths and angles are almost perfectly Gaussian distributed, and we thus normalize them by
shifting each distribution to a mean of 0 and scaling it to have standard deviation 1, which results
all reference distributions to collapse to a normal distribution (Fig. 5a,c). We normalize the gener-
ated distribution with the mean and standard distribution of the true data. Although there are clear
differences (Fig. 5b,d), these distributions are very encouraging. Bonds and angles are very stiff de-
grees of freedom, and the fact that most differences in mean and standard deviation are small when
compared to the true ﬂuctuation width means that the generated structures are close to physically
accurate and could be reﬁned by little additional MD simulation effort.

Finally, we perform an experiment to test whether the DeepGenMSM is able to generate genuinely
new conﬁgurations that do exist for Alanine dipeptide but have not been seen in the training data. In
other words, can the generator “extrapolate” in a meaningful way? This is a fundamental question,
because simulating MD is exorbitantly expensive, with each simulation time step being computation-
ally expensive but progressing time only of the order of 10−15 seconds, while often total simulation

timescales of 10−3 seconds or longer are needed. A DeepGenMSM that makes leaps of length τ
– orders of magnitude larger than the MD simulation time-step – and has even a small chance of
generating new and meaningful structures would be extremely valuable to discover new states and
thereby accelerate MD sampling.

To test this ability, we conduct six experiments, in each of which we remove all data belonging to one
of the six metastable states of Alanine dipeptide (6a). We train a DeepGenMSM with each of these
datasets separately, and simulate it to predict the stationary distribution (6b). While the generated
stationary distributions are skewed and the shape of the distribution in the (φ, ψ) range with missing-
data are not quantitatively predicted, the DeepGenMSMs do indeed predict conﬁgurations where no
training data was present (6b). Surprisingly, the quality of most of these conﬁgurations is high (6c).
While the structures of the two low-populated states 5-6 do not look realistic, each of the metastable
states 1-4 are generated with high quality, as shown by the overlap of a real MD structure and the
100 most similar generated structures (6c).

In conclusion, deep MSMs provide high-quality models of the stationary and kinetic properties for
stochastic dynamical systems such as MD simulations.
In contrast to other high-quality models
such as VAMPnets, the resulting model is truly probabilistic and can thus be physically interpreted
and be used in a Bayesian framework. For the ﬁrst time, it was shown that generating dynamical
trajectories in a 30-dimensional molecular conﬁguration space results in sampling of physically
realistic molecular structures. While Alanine dipeptide is a small system compared to proteins and
other macromolecules that are of biological interest, our results demonstrate that efﬁcient sampling
of new molecular structures is possible with generative dynamic models, and improved methods
can be built upon this. Future methods will especially need to address the difﬁculties of generating
valid conﬁgurations in low-probability regimes, and it is likely that the energy distance used here
for generator training needs to be revisited to achieve this goal.

Analysis of transition matrices

The transition matrix K(τ ) = [kij(τ )] ∈ Rm×m is deﬁned as

kij(τ ) = P(xt+τ ∈ state j|xt ∈ state i).

Then, according to (1), we have

kij(τ ) =

P(xt+τ = y|xt ∈ state i) · P(xt+τ ∈ state j|xt+τ = y)dy

(cid:90)

(cid:90)

=

qi(y; τ )χj(y) dy,

and

If χ, q satisfy the conditions

kij(nτ ) = [K(τ )n]ij .

χi(x) ≥ 0, (cid:80)
j χj(x) = 1,
qi(x; τ ) ≥ 0, (cid:82) qi(y; τ )dy = 1, ∀x, i,
j kij(τ ) = 1, i.e., K(τ ) computed from χ, q is a valid transition

we have kij(τ ) ≥ 0 and (cid:80)

= µ(y),

which shows µ is the stationary distribution of model (1).

VAMP-E training of deep MSMs

An alternative to ML training is to employ a score from the Variational Approach of Markov Pro-
cesses (VAMP) [31]. The VAMP-E score has the advantage over other VAMP scores employed
previously [15] that we do not have to specify the rank of the model [31]. The VAMP-E score is
computed as

RE = tr

(cid:16)

2C01 ¯Γ−1 − C00 ¯Γ−1C11 ¯Γ−1(cid:17)

(14)

which depends on covariance matrices estimated from the transformed data:

[C00]ij = Et[χi(xt)χj(xt)]
[C11]ij = Et[γi(xt+τ )γj(xt+τ )]
[C01]ij = Et[χi(xt)γj(xt+τ )]
¯Γ = diag(¯γ1, . . . , ¯γm).
We can use the standard empirical estimators to compute Et. We can then train a deep MSM using
the structure shown in Fig. 1 by maximizing (14).

Using the Energy Distance to train generative networks

The Energy Distance (ED) [28] is a metric that measures the difference between the distributions of
two real valued random vectors x and y, and is deﬁned as

DE(P(x), P(y)) = E [2 (cid:107)x − y(cid:107) − (cid:107)x − x(cid:48)(cid:107) − (cid:107)y − y(cid:48)(cid:107)] .
(15)
Here, x(cid:48), y(cid:48) are independently distributed according to the distributions of y, z. Therefore, the con-
ditional energy distance given in (12) is equal to the mean value of the energy distance between the

11

conditional distributions P(xt+τ |xt) and P(ˆxt+τ |xt) for all xt, and satisﬁes that D ≥ 0 and D = 0
if and only if P(xt+τ |xt) = P(ˆxt+τ |xt) for all xt.

Motivation of Energy Distance as the training metric

The major advantages of ED are:

1. It can be unbiasedly estimated from the data without an extra “adversarial” network as in

GANs.

2. Unlike the KL divergence (see example 1 in [1]), ED does not diverge in the case of few

data points (small batch sizes) or low populated probability density areas.

3. As a speciﬁc Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD), ED can avoid the problem of popular
kernel-MMDs that the gradients of cost functions are vanished if the generated samples
are far away from the training data, and therefore achieve higher efﬁciency when learning
generative models.

Network architecture and training procedure

All neural networks representing the functions χ, γ and G for the Prinz potential are using 64
nodes in all 4 hidden layers and batch normalization after each layer [9]. Rectiﬁed linear activation
functions (ReLUs) are used, except for the output layer of χ which uses SoftMax and the output
layer of G which has a linear activation function. Both χ and γ have 4 output nodes, and G receives
a four-dimensional 1-hot-encoding of the metastable state plus a four-dimensional noise vector as
inputs. Optimization is done using Adam [10], with early stopping checking if the validation score
is not increasing over 5 epochs. The learning rate for the training of χ, γ is λ = 10−3, and for G
λ = 10−5 with a batchsize of 100. We are using a time-lag of τ = 5 frames.

For alanine dipeptide, χ and γ consist both of 3 residual blocks [7] built of 3 layers all having 100
nodes, with exponential linear units (ELUs) [5], and batch normalization for each layer. The output
layer has 6 output nodes, where χ uses a softmax activation function and γ a RELU, respectively.
In order to ﬁnd all slow processes, it was necessary to pre-train χ with the VAMPnet method [15].
The generator G uses 6 noise inputs and a six-dimensional 1-hot-encoding of the metastable state
and the ML-ED scheme. Networks are trained with Adam until the validation score converges with
a learning rate of λ = 10−5 for χ, γ using 8000 as batchsize and λ = 10−4 for G using 1500 frames
for a batch. All subsequent analyses that use a ﬁxed lag time employ τ = 1 ps.

For ﬁnding the hyperparameter we performed a restricted grid search, which showed comparing the
KL divergence between the modeled distributions that the result does only marginally depend on the
choice of the parameters (see 1 for an example).
