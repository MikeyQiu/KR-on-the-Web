Abstract

Representation learning is the foundation of machine reading comprehension. In state-of-the-art
models, deep learning methods broadly use word and character level representations. However,
character is not naturally the minimal linguistic unit. In addition, with a simple concatenation
of character and word embedding, previous models actually give suboptimal solution. In this
paper, we propose to use subword rather than character for word embedding enhancement. We
also empirically explore different augmentation strategies on subword-augmented embedding to
enhance the cloze-style reading comprehension model (reader). In detail, we present a reader
that uses subword-level representation to augment word embedding with a short list to handle
rare words effectively. A thorough examination is conducted to evaluate the comprehensive
performance and generalization ability of the proposed reader. Experimental results show that
the proposed approach helps the reader signiﬁcantly outperform the state-of-the-art baselines on
various public datasets.

Introduction

A recent hot challenge is to train machines to read and comprehend human languages. Towards this end,
various machine reading comprehension datasets have been released, including cloze-style (Hermann et
al., 2015; Hill et al., 2015; Cui et al., 2016) and user-query types (Joshi et al., 2017; Rajpurkar et al.,
2016). Meanwhile, a number of deep learning models are designed to take up the challenges, most of
which focus on attention mechanism (Wang et al., 2017b; Seo et al., 2017; Cui et al., 2017a; Kadlec et
al., 2016; Dhingra et al., 2017; Zhang and Zhao, 2018). However, how to represent word in an effective
way remains an open problem for diverse natural language processing tasks, including machine reading
comprehension for different languages. Particularly, for a language like Chinese with a large set of
characters (typically, thousands of), lots of which are semantically ambiguous, using either word-level or
character-level embedding alone to build the word representations would not be accurate enough. This
work especially focuses on a cloze-style reading comprehension task over fairy stories, which is highly
challenging due to diverse semantic patterns with personiﬁed expressions and reference.

In real practice, a reading comprehension model or system which is often called reader in literatures
easily suffers from out-of-vocabulary (OOV) word issues, especially for the cloze-style reading compre-
hension tasks when the ground-truth answers tend to include rare words or named entities (NE), which
are hardly fully recorded in the vocabulary. This is more challenging in Chinese. There are over 13,000
characters in Chinese1 while there are only 26 letters in English without regard to punctuation marks. If
a reading comprehension system cannot effectively manage the OOV issues, the performance will not be
semantically accurate for the task.

Figure 1: Architecture of the proposed Subword-augmented Embedding Reader (SAW Reader).

Commonly, words are represented as vectors using either word embedding or character embedding.
For the former, each word is mapped into low dimensional dense vectors from a lookup table. Character
representations are usually obtained by applying neural networks on the character sequence of the word,
and their hidden states are obtained to form the representation. Intuitively, word-level representation is
good at catching global context and dependency relationships between words, while character embedding
helps for dealing with rare word representation.

However, the minimal meaningful unit below word usually is not character, which motivates re-
searchers to explore the potential unit (subword) between character and word to model sub-word mor-
phologies or lexical semantics. In fact, morphological compounding (e.g. sunshine or playground) is
one of the most common and productive methods of word formation across human languages, which in-
spires us to represent word by meaningful sub-word units. Recently, researchers have started to work on
morphologically informed word embeddings (Botha and Blunsom, 2014; Cao and Rei, 2016), aiming at
better capturing syntactic, lexical and morphological information. With ready subwords, we do not have
to work with characters, and segmentation could be stopped at the subword-level to reach a meaningful
representation.

In this paper, we present various simple yet accurate subword-augmented embedding (SAW) strategies
and propose SAW Reader as an instance. Speciﬁcally, we adopt subword information to enrich word em-
bedding and survey different SAW operations to integrate word-level and subword-level embedding for a
ﬁne-grained representation. To ensure adequate training of OOV and low-frequency words, we employ a
short list mechanism. Our evaluation will be performed on three public Chinese reading comprehension
datasets and one English benchmark dataset for showing our method is also effective in multi-lingual
case.

2 The Subword-augmented Word Embedding

The concerned reading comprehension task can be roughly categorized as user-query type and cloze-style
according to the answer form. Answers in the former are usually a span of texts while in the cloze-style
task, the answers are words or phrases which lets the latter be the harder-hit area of OOV issues, inspiring
us to select the cloze-style as our testbed for SAW strategies. Our preliminary study shows even for the
advanced word-character based GA reader, OOV answers still account for nearly 1/5 in the error results.

This also motivates us to explore better representations to further performance improvement.

The cloze-style task in this work can be described as a triple < D, Q, A >, where D is a document
(context), Q is a query over the contents of D, in which a word or phrase is the right answer A. This
section will introduce the proposed SAW Reader in the context of cloze-style reading comprehension.
Given the triple < D, Q, A >, the SAW Reader will be built in the following steps.

2.1 BPE Subword Segmentation

Word in most languages usually can be split into meaningful subword units despite of the writing form.
For example, “indispensable” could be split into the following subwords: < in, disp, ens, able >.

In our implementation, we adopt Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) (Gage and Philip, 1994) which is a simple
data compression technique that iteratively replaces the most frequent pair of bytes in a sequence by
a single, unused byte. BPE allows for the representation of an open vocabulary through a ﬁxed-size
vocabulary of variable-length character sequences, making it a very suitable word segmentation strategy
for neural network models.

The generalized framework can be described as follows. Firstly, all the input sequences (strings) are

tokenized into a sequence of single-character subwords, then we repeat,

1. Count all bigrams under the current segmentation status of all sequences.

2. Find the bigram with the highest frequency and merge them in all the sequences. Note the segmen-

tation status is updating now.

3. If the merging times do not reach the speciﬁed number, go back to 1, otherwise the algorithm ends.

In (Sennrich et al., 2016), BPE is adopted to segment infrequent words into sub-word units for ma-
chine translation. However, there is a key difference between the motivations for subword segmentation.
We aim to reﬁne the word representations by using subwords, for both frequent and infrequent words,
which is more generally motivated. To this end, we adaptively tokenize words in multi-granularity by
controlling the merging times.

2.2 Subword-augmented Word Embedding

Our subwords are also formed as character n-grams, do not cross word boundaries. After using unsuper-
vised segmentation methods to split each word into a subword sequence, an augmented embedding (AE)
is to straightforwardly integrate word embedding W E(w) and subword embedding SE(w) for a given
word w.

AE(w) = W E(w) (cid:5) SE(w)

where (cid:5) denotes the detailed integration operation. In this work, we investigate concatenation (concat),
element-wise summation (sum) and element-wise multiplication (mul). Thus, each document D and
query Q is represented as Rd×k matrix where d denotes the dimension of word embedding and k is the
number of words in the input.

Subword embedding could be useful to reﬁne the word embedding in a ﬁner-grained way, we also
consider improving word representation from itself. For quite a lot of words, especially those rare ones,
their word embedding is extremely hard to learn due to the data sparse issue. Actually, if all the words
in the dataset are used to build the vocabulary, the OOV words from the test set will not obtain adequate
training. If they are initiated inappropriately, either with relatively high or low weights, they will harm
the answer prediction. To alleviate the OOV issues, we keep a short list H for speciﬁc words.

H = {w1, w2, . . . , wn}

If w is in H, the immediate word embedding W E(w) is indexed from word lookup table M w ∈ Rd×s
where s denotes the size (recorded words) of lookup table. Otherwise, it will be represented as the
randomly initialized default word (denoted by a speciﬁc mark U N K). Note that, this is intuitively

like “guessing” the possible unknown words (which will appear during test) from the vocabulary during
training and only the word embedding of the OOV words will be replaced by U N K while their subword
embedding SE(w) will still be processed using the original word. In this way, the OOV words could be
tuned sufﬁciently with expressive meaning after training. During test, the word embedding of unknown
words would not severely bias its ﬁnal representation. Thus, AE(w) can be rewritten as

AE(w) =

(cid:26) W E(w) (cid:5) SE(w)
U N K (cid:5) SE(w)

if w ∈ H
otherwise

In our experiments, the short list is determined according to the word frequency. Concretely, we sort
the vocabulary according to the word frequency from high to low. A frequency ﬁlter ratio γ is set to ﬁlter
out the low-frequency words (rare words) from the lookup table. For example, γ=0.9 means the least
frequent 10% words are replaced with the default UNK notation.

The subword embedding SE(w) is generated by taking the ﬁnal outputs of a bidirectional gated re-
current unit (GRU) (Cho et al., 2014) applied to the embeddings from a lookup table of subwords. The
structure of GRU used in this paper are described as follows.

rt = σ(Wrxt + Urht−1 + br),
zt = σ(Wzxt + Uzht−1 + bz),
˜ht = tanh(Whxt + Uh(rt (cid:12) ht−1) + bh)
ht = (1 − zt) (cid:12) ht−1 + zt (cid:12) ˜ht

where (cid:12) denotes the element-wise multiplication. rt and zt are the reset and update gates respectively,
and ˜ht are the hidden states. A bi-directional GRU (BiGRU) processes the sequence in both forward and
backward directions. Subwords of each word are successively fed to forward GRU and backward GRU
to obtain the internal features of two directions. The output for each input is the concatenation of the two
←−
ht. Then, the output of BiGRUs is passed to a fully connected
vectors from both directions:
layer to obtain the ﬁnal subword embedding SE(w).

2.3 Attention Module

Our attention module is based on the Gated attention Reader (GA Reader) proposed by (Dhingra et al.,
2017). We choose this model due to its simplicity with comparable performance so that we can focus
on the effectiveness of SAW strategies. This module can be described in the following two steps. After
augmented embedding, we use two BiGRUs to get contextual representations of the document and query
respectively, where the representation of each word is formed by concatenating the forward and backward
hidden states.

Hq = BiGRU(Q)
Hd = BiGRU(D)

For each word di in Hd, we form a word-speciﬁc representation of the query qi ∈ Hq using soft atten-
tion, and then adopt element-wise product to multiply the query representation with the document word
representation.

q di)

αi = sof tmax(H (cid:62)
βi = Qαi
xi = di (cid:12) βi

p = sof tmax((qt)(cid:62)HD)

P (w|D, Q) ∝

(cid:88)

pi

i∈I(w,D)

A∗ = argmaxw∈CP (w|D, Q)

where (cid:12) denotes the multiplication operator to model the interactions between di and qi. Then, the
document contextual representation ˜Hd = {x1, x2, . . . , xk} is gated by query representation.

Suppose the network has K layers. At each layer, the document representation ˜Hd is updated through
above attention learning. After going through all the layers, our model comes to answer prediction phase.
We use all the words in the document to form the candidate set C. Let qt denote the t-th intermediate
output of query representation Hq and HD represent the full output of document representation ˜Hd. The
probability of each candidate word w ∈ C as being the answer is predicted using a softmax layer over
the inner-product between qt and HD.

where vector p denotes the probability distribution over all the words in the document. Note that each
word may occur several times in the document. Thus, the probabilities of each candidate word occurring
in different positions of the document are summed up for ﬁnal prediction.

where I(w, d) denotes the set of positions that a particular word w occurs in the document D. The
training objective is to maximize log P (A|D, Q) where A is the correct answer.

Finally, the candidate word with the highest probability will be chosen as the predicted answer.

Different from recent work employing complex attention mechanisms (Wang et al., 2017b; Cui et al.,
2017a; Sordoni et al., 2016), our attention mechanism is much more simple with comparable perfor-
mance so that we can focus on the effectiveness of SAW strategies.

3 Experiments

3.1 Dataset and Settings

To verify the effectiveness of our proposed model, we conduct multiple experiments on three Chinese
Machine Reading Comprehension datasets, namely CMRC-2017 (Cui et al., 2017b), People’s Daily
(PD) and Children Fairy Tales (CFT) (Cui et al., 2016)2. In these datasets, a story containing consecutive
sentences is formed as the Document and one of the sentences is either automatically or manually selected
as the Query where one token is replaced by a placeholder to indicate the answer to ﬁll in. Table 1 gives
data statistics. Different from the current cloze-style datasets for English reading comprehension, such
as CBT, Daily Mail and CNN (Hermann et al., 2015), the three Chinese datasets do not provide candidate
answers. Thus, the model has to ﬁnd the correct answer from the entire document.

Besides, we also use the Children’s Book Test (CBT) dataset (Hill et al., 2015) to test the generalization
ability in multi-lingual case. We only focus on subsets where the answer is either a common noun (CN)

2Note that the test set of CMRC-2017 and human evaluation test set (Test-human) of CFT are harder for the machine to
answer because the questions are further processed manually and may not be accordance with the pattern of automatic questions.

or NE which is more challenging since the answer is likely to be rare words. We evaluate all the models
in terms of accuracy, which is the standard evaluation metric for this task.

Throughout this paper, we use the same model setting to make fair comparisons. According to our
preliminary experiments, we report the results based on the following settings. The default integration
strategy is element-wise product. Word embeddings were 200d and pre-trained by word2vec (Mikolov
et al., 2013) toolkit on Wikipedia corpus3. Subword embedding were 100d and randomly initialized
with the uniformed distribution in the interval [-0:05; 0:05]. Our model was implemented using the
Theano4 and Lasagne Python libraries5. We used stochastic gradient descent with ADAM updates for
optimization (Kingma and Ba, 2014). The batch size was 64 and the initial learning rate was 0.001 which
was halved every epoch after the second epoch. We also used gradient clipping with a threshold of 10
to stabilize GRU training (Pascanu et al., 2013). We use three attention layers for all experiments. The
GRU hidden units for both the word and subword representation were 128. The default frequency ﬁlter
proportion was 0.9 and the default merging times of BPE was 1,000. We also apply dropout between
layers with a dropout rate of 0.5 6.

3.2 Main Results

CMRC-2017 Table 2 shows our results on CMRC-2017 dataset, which shows that our SAW Reader
(mul) outperforms all other single models on the test set, with 7.57% improvements compared with
Attention Sum Reader (AS Reader) baseline. Although WHU’s model achieves the best besides our
model on the valid set with only 0.75% below ours, their result on the test set is lower than ours by
2.27%, indicating our model has a satisfactory generalization ability.

We also list different integration operations for word and subword embeddings. Table 3 shows the
comparisons. From the results, we can see that Word + BPE outperforms Word + Char which indicates
subword embedding works essentially. We also observe that mul outperforms the other two operations,
concat and sum. This reveals that mul might be more informative than concat and sum operations. The
superiority might be due to element-wise product being capable of modeling the interactions and elimi-
nating distribution differences between word and subword embedding. Intuitively, this is also similar to
endow subword-aware “attention” over the word embedding. In contrast, concatenation operation may
cause too high dimension, which leads to serious over-ﬁtting issues, and sum operation is too simple to
prevent from detailed information losing.

PD & CFT Since there is no training set for CFT dataset, our model is trained on PD training set.
Note that the CFT dataset is harder for the machine to answer because the test set is further processed
by human evaluation, and may not be accordance with the pattern of PD dataset. The results on PD and
CFT datasets are listed in Table 4. As we see that, our SAW Reader signiﬁcantly outperforms the CAS
Reader in all types of testing, with improvements of 7.0% on PD and 8.8% on CFT test sets, respectively.
Although the domain and topic of PD and CFT datasets are quite different, the results indicate that our
model also works effectively for out-of-domain learning.

CBT To verify if our method can only work for Chinese, we also evaluate the effectiveness of the
proposed method on benchmark English dataset. We use CBT dataset as our testbed to evaluate the
performance. For a fair comparison, we simply set the same parameters as before. Table 5 shows
the results. We observe that our model outperforms most of the previously public works, with 2.4 %
gains on the CBT-NE test set compared with GA Reader which adopts word and character embedding
concatenation. Our SAW Reader also achieves comparable performance with FG Reader who adopts
neural gates to combine word-level and character-level representations with assistance of extra features
including NE, POS and word frequency while our model is much simpler and faster. This result shows
our SAW Reader is not restricted to Chinese reading comprehension, but also for other languages.

4 Analysis

4.1 Merging Times of BPE

The vocabulary size could seriously involve the segmentation granularity. For BPE segmentation, the
resulted subword vocabulary size is equal to the merging times plus the number of single-character types.
To have an insight of the inﬂuence, we adopt merge times from 0 to 20k, and conduct quantitative study
on CMRC-2017 for BPE segmentation. Figure 2 shows the results. We observe that when the vocabulary
size is 1k, the models could obtain the best performance. The results indicate that for a task like reading
comprehension the subwords, being a highly ﬂexible grained representation between character and word,
tends to be more like characters instead of words. However, when the subwords completely fall into
characters, the model performs the worst. This indicates that the balance between word and character
is quite critical and an appropriate grain of character-word segmentation could essentially improve the
word representation.

ulary size of BPE.

ence of the short list.

4.2 Filter Mechanism

To investigate the impact of the short list to the model performance, we conduct quantitative study on the
ﬁlter ratio from [0.1, 0.2, . . . , 1]. The results on the CMRC-2017 dataset are depicted in Figure 3. As
we can see that when γ = 0.9 our SAW reader can obtain the best performance, showing that building
the vocabulary among all the training set is not optimal and properly reducing the frequency ﬁlter ratio
can boost the accuracy. This is partially attributed to training the model from the full vocabulary would
cause serious over-ﬁtting as the rare words representations can not obtain sufﬁcient tuning. If the rare
words are not initialized properly, they would also bias the whole word representations. Thus a model
without OOV mechanism will fail to precisely represent those inevitable OOV words from test sets.

4.3 Subword-Augmented Representations

In text understanding tasks, if the ground-truth answer is OOV word or contains OOV word(s), the per-
formance of deep neural networks would severely drop due to the incomplete representation, especially
for cloze-style reading comprehension task where the answer is only one word or phrase. In CMRC-
2017, we observe questions with OOV answers (denoted as “OOV questions”) account for 17.22% in the
error results of the best Word + Char embedding based model. With BPE subword embedding, 12.17%
of these “OOV questions” could be correctly answered. This shows the subword representations could
be essentially useful for modeling rare and unseen words.

To analyze the reading process of SAW Reader, we draw the attention distributions at intermediate

layers as shown in Figure 4. We observe the salient candidates in the document can be focused after the
pair-wise matching of document and query and the right answer (“The mole”) could obtain a high weight
at the very beginning. After attention learning, the key evidence of the answer would be collected and
irrelevant parts would be ignored. This shows our SAW Reader is effective at selecting the vital points
at the fundamental embedding layer, guiding the attention layers to collect more relevant pieces.

5 Related Work

5.1 Machine Reading Comprehension

Recently, many deep learning models have been proposed for reading comprehension (Sordoni et al.,
2016; Trischler et al., 2016; Wang and Jiang, 2016; Munkhdalai and Yu, 2017; Wang et al., 2017a;
Dhingra et al., 2017; Zhang et al., 2018b; Wang et al., 2018b). Notably, Chen et al. (2016) conducted
an in-depth and thoughtful examination on the comprehension task based on an attentive neural network
and an entity-centric classiﬁer with a careful analysis based on handful features. Kadlec et al. (2016)
proposed the Attention Sum Reader (AS Reader) that uses attention to directly pick the answer from the
context, which is motivated by the Pointer Network (Vinyals et al., 2015). Instead of summing the atten-
tion of query-to-document, GA Reader (Dhingra et al., 2017) deﬁned an element-wise product to endow-
ing attention on each word of the document using the entire query representation to build query-speciﬁc
representations of words in the document for accurate answer selection. Wang et al. (2017b) employed
gated self-matching networks (R-net) on passage against passage itself to reﬁne passage representation
with information from the whole passage. Cui et al. (2017a) introduced an “attended attention” mecha-
nism (AoA) where query-to-document and document-to-query are mutually attentive and interactive to
each other.

Distributed word representation plays a fundamental role in neural models (Cai and Zhao, 2016; Qin
et al., 2016; Zhao et al., 2017; Peters et al., 2018; He et al., 2018; Wang et al., 2018a; Bai and Zhao,
2018; Zhang et al., 2018a). Recently, character embeddings are widely used to enrich word representa-
tions (Kim et al., 2016; Yang et al., 2017; Luong and Manning, 2016; Huang et al., 2018). Yang et al.
(2017) explored a ﬁne-grained gating mechanism (FG Reader) to dynamically combine word-level and
character-level representations based on properties of the words. However, this method is computation-
ally complex and it is not end-to-end, requiring extra labels such as NE and POS tags. Seo et al. (2017)

concatenated the character and word embedding to feed a two-layer Highway Network.

Not only for machine reading comprehension tasks, character embedding has also beneﬁt other natural
language process tasks, such as word segmentation (Cai et al., 2017), machine translation (Luong and
Manning, 2016), tagging (Yang et al., 2016; Li et al., 2018) and language modeling (Verwimp et al.,
2017; Miyamoto and Cho, 2016). However, character embedding only shows marginal improvement
due to a lack internal semantics. Lexical, syntactic and morphological information are also considered
to improve word representation (Cao and Rei, 2016; Bergmanis and Goldwater, 2017). Bojanowski et
al. (2017) proposed to learn representations for character n-gram vectors and represent words as the sum
of the n-gram vectors. Avraham and Goldberg (2017) built a model inspired by (Joulin et al., 2017),
who used morphological tags instead of n-grams. They jointly trained their morphological and semantic
embeddings, implicitly assuming that morphological and semantic information should live in the same
space. However, the linguistic knowledge resulting subwords, typically, morphological sufﬁx, preﬁx or
stem, may not be suitable for different kinds of languages and tasks. Sennrich et al. (2016) introduced
the byte pair encoding (BPE) compression algorithm into neural machine translation for being capable
of open-vocabulary translation by encoding rare and unknown words as subword units.
Instead, we
consider reﬁning the word representations for both frequent and infrequent words from a computational
perspective. Our proposed subword-augmented embedding approach is more general, which can be
adopted to enhance the representation for each word by adaptively altering the segmentation granularity
in multiple NLP tasks.

6 Conclusion

This paper presents an effective neural architecture, called subword-augmented word embedding to en-
hance the model performance for the cloze-style reading comprehension task. The proposed SAW Reader
uses subword embedding to enhance the word representation and limit the word frequency spectrum to
train rare words efﬁciently. With the help of the short list, the model size will also be reduced together
with training speedup. Unlike most existing works, which introduce either complex attentive architec-
tures or many manual features, our model is much more simple yet effective. Giving state-of-the-art
performance on multiple benchmarks, the proposed reader has been proved effective for learning joint
representation at both word and subword level and alleviating OOV difﬁculties.

Abstract

Representation learning is the foundation of machine reading comprehension. In state-of-the-art
models, deep learning methods broadly use word and character level representations. However,
character is not naturally the minimal linguistic unit. In addition, with a simple concatenation
of character and word embedding, previous models actually give suboptimal solution. In this
paper, we propose to use subword rather than character for word embedding enhancement. We
also empirically explore different augmentation strategies on subword-augmented embedding to
enhance the cloze-style reading comprehension model (reader). In detail, we present a reader
that uses subword-level representation to augment word embedding with a short list to handle
rare words effectively. A thorough examination is conducted to evaluate the comprehensive
performance and generalization ability of the proposed reader. Experimental results show that
the proposed approach helps the reader signiﬁcantly outperform the state-of-the-art baselines on
various public datasets.

Introduction

A recent hot challenge is to train machines to read and comprehend human languages. Towards this end,
various machine reading comprehension datasets have been released, including cloze-style (Hermann et
al., 2015; Hill et al., 2015; Cui et al., 2016) and user-query types (Joshi et al., 2017; Rajpurkar et al.,
2016). Meanwhile, a number of deep learning models are designed to take up the challenges, most of
which focus on attention mechanism (Wang et al., 2017b; Seo et al., 2017; Cui et al., 2017a; Kadlec et
al., 2016; Dhingra et al., 2017; Zhang and Zhao, 2018). However, how to represent word in an effective
way remains an open problem for diverse natural language processing tasks, including machine reading
comprehension for different languages. Particularly, for a language like Chinese with a large set of
characters (typically, thousands of), lots of which are semantically ambiguous, using either word-level or
character-level embedding alone to build the word representations would not be accurate enough. This
work especially focuses on a cloze-style reading comprehension task over fairy stories, which is highly
challenging due to diverse semantic patterns with personiﬁed expressions and reference.

In real practice, a reading comprehension model or system which is often called reader in literatures
easily suffers from out-of-vocabulary (OOV) word issues, especially for the cloze-style reading compre-
hension tasks when the ground-truth answers tend to include rare words or named entities (NE), which
are hardly fully recorded in the vocabulary. This is more challenging in Chinese. There are over 13,000
characters in Chinese1 while there are only 26 letters in English without regard to punctuation marks. If
a reading comprehension system cannot effectively manage the OOV issues, the performance will not be
semantically accurate for the task.

Figure 1: Architecture of the proposed Subword-augmented Embedding Reader (SAW Reader).

Commonly, words are represented as vectors using either word embedding or character embedding.
For the former, each word is mapped into low dimensional dense vectors from a lookup table. Character
representations are usually obtained by applying neural networks on the character sequence of the word,
and their hidden states are obtained to form the representation. Intuitively, word-level representation is
good at catching global context and dependency relationships between words, while character embedding
helps for dealing with rare word representation.

However, the minimal meaningful unit below word usually is not character, which motivates re-
searchers to explore the potential unit (subword) between character and word to model sub-word mor-
phologies or lexical semantics. In fact, morphological compounding (e.g. sunshine or playground) is
one of the most common and productive methods of word formation across human languages, which in-
spires us to represent word by meaningful sub-word units. Recently, researchers have started to work on
morphologically informed word embeddings (Botha and Blunsom, 2014; Cao and Rei, 2016), aiming at
better capturing syntactic, lexical and morphological information. With ready subwords, we do not have
to work with characters, and segmentation could be stopped at the subword-level to reach a meaningful
representation.

In this paper, we present various simple yet accurate subword-augmented embedding (SAW) strategies
and propose SAW Reader as an instance. Speciﬁcally, we adopt subword information to enrich word em-
bedding and survey different SAW operations to integrate word-level and subword-level embedding for a
ﬁne-grained representation. To ensure adequate training of OOV and low-frequency words, we employ a
short list mechanism. Our evaluation will be performed on three public Chinese reading comprehension
datasets and one English benchmark dataset for showing our method is also effective in multi-lingual
case.

2 The Subword-augmented Word Embedding

The concerned reading comprehension task can be roughly categorized as user-query type and cloze-style
according to the answer form. Answers in the former are usually a span of texts while in the cloze-style
task, the answers are words or phrases which lets the latter be the harder-hit area of OOV issues, inspiring
us to select the cloze-style as our testbed for SAW strategies. Our preliminary study shows even for the
advanced word-character based GA reader, OOV answers still account for nearly 1/5 in the error results.

This also motivates us to explore better representations to further performance improvement.

The cloze-style task in this work can be described as a triple < D, Q, A >, where D is a document
(context), Q is a query over the contents of D, in which a word or phrase is the right answer A. This
section will introduce the proposed SAW Reader in the context of cloze-style reading comprehension.
Given the triple < D, Q, A >, the SAW Reader will be built in the following steps.

2.1 BPE Subword Segmentation

Word in most languages usually can be split into meaningful subword units despite of the writing form.
For example, “indispensable” could be split into the following subwords: < in, disp, ens, able >.

In our implementation, we adopt Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) (Gage and Philip, 1994) which is a simple
data compression technique that iteratively replaces the most frequent pair of bytes in a sequence by
a single, unused byte. BPE allows for the representation of an open vocabulary through a ﬁxed-size
vocabulary of variable-length character sequences, making it a very suitable word segmentation strategy
for neural network models.

The generalized framework can be described as follows. Firstly, all the input sequences (strings) are

tokenized into a sequence of single-character subwords, then we repeat,

1. Count all bigrams under the current segmentation status of all sequences.

2. Find the bigram with the highest frequency and merge them in all the sequences. Note the segmen-

tation status is updating now.

3. If the merging times do not reach the speciﬁed number, go back to 1, otherwise the algorithm ends.

In (Sennrich et al., 2016), BPE is adopted to segment infrequent words into sub-word units for ma-
chine translation. However, there is a key difference between the motivations for subword segmentation.
We aim to reﬁne the word representations by using subwords, for both frequent and infrequent words,
which is more generally motivated. To this end, we adaptively tokenize words in multi-granularity by
controlling the merging times.

2.2 Subword-augmented Word Embedding

Our subwords are also formed as character n-grams, do not cross word boundaries. After using unsuper-
vised segmentation methods to split each word into a subword sequence, an augmented embedding (AE)
is to straightforwardly integrate word embedding W E(w) and subword embedding SE(w) for a given
word w.

AE(w) = W E(w) (cid:5) SE(w)

where (cid:5) denotes the detailed integration operation. In this work, we investigate concatenation (concat),
element-wise summation (sum) and element-wise multiplication (mul). Thus, each document D and
query Q is represented as Rd×k matrix where d denotes the dimension of word embedding and k is the
number of words in the input.

Subword embedding could be useful to reﬁne the word embedding in a ﬁner-grained way, we also
consider improving word representation from itself. For quite a lot of words, especially those rare ones,
their word embedding is extremely hard to learn due to the data sparse issue. Actually, if all the words
in the dataset are used to build the vocabulary, the OOV words from the test set will not obtain adequate
training. If they are initiated inappropriately, either with relatively high or low weights, they will harm
the answer prediction. To alleviate the OOV issues, we keep a short list H for speciﬁc words.

H = {w1, w2, . . . , wn}

If w is in H, the immediate word embedding W E(w) is indexed from word lookup table M w ∈ Rd×s
where s denotes the size (recorded words) of lookup table. Otherwise, it will be represented as the
randomly initialized default word (denoted by a speciﬁc mark U N K). Note that, this is intuitively

like “guessing” the possible unknown words (which will appear during test) from the vocabulary during
training and only the word embedding of the OOV words will be replaced by U N K while their subword
embedding SE(w) will still be processed using the original word. In this way, the OOV words could be
tuned sufﬁciently with expressive meaning after training. During test, the word embedding of unknown
words would not severely bias its ﬁnal representation. Thus, AE(w) can be rewritten as

AE(w) =

(cid:26) W E(w) (cid:5) SE(w)
U N K (cid:5) SE(w)

if w ∈ H
otherwise

In our experiments, the short list is determined according to the word frequency. Concretely, we sort
the vocabulary according to the word frequency from high to low. A frequency ﬁlter ratio γ is set to ﬁlter
out the low-frequency words (rare words) from the lookup table. For example, γ=0.9 means the least
frequent 10% words are replaced with the default UNK notation.

The subword embedding SE(w) is generated by taking the ﬁnal outputs of a bidirectional gated re-
current unit (GRU) (Cho et al., 2014) applied to the embeddings from a lookup table of subwords. The
structure of GRU used in this paper are described as follows.

rt = σ(Wrxt + Urht−1 + br),
zt = σ(Wzxt + Uzht−1 + bz),
˜ht = tanh(Whxt + Uh(rt (cid:12) ht−1) + bh)
ht = (1 − zt) (cid:12) ht−1 + zt (cid:12) ˜ht

where (cid:12) denotes the element-wise multiplication. rt and zt are the reset and update gates respectively,
and ˜ht are the hidden states. A bi-directional GRU (BiGRU) processes the sequence in both forward and
backward directions. Subwords of each word are successively fed to forward GRU and backward GRU
to obtain the internal features of two directions. The output for each input is the concatenation of the two
←−
ht. Then, the output of BiGRUs is passed to a fully connected
vectors from both directions:
layer to obtain the ﬁnal subword embedding SE(w).

2.3 Attention Module

Our attention module is based on the Gated attention Reader (GA Reader) proposed by (Dhingra et al.,
2017). We choose this model due to its simplicity with comparable performance so that we can focus
on the effectiveness of SAW strategies. This module can be described in the following two steps. After
augmented embedding, we use two BiGRUs to get contextual representations of the document and query
respectively, where the representation of each word is formed by concatenating the forward and backward
hidden states.

Hq = BiGRU(Q)
Hd = BiGRU(D)

For each word di in Hd, we form a word-speciﬁc representation of the query qi ∈ Hq using soft atten-
tion, and then adopt element-wise product to multiply the query representation with the document word
representation.

q di)

αi = sof tmax(H (cid:62)
βi = Qαi
xi = di (cid:12) βi

p = sof tmax((qt)(cid:62)HD)

P (w|D, Q) ∝

(cid:88)

pi

i∈I(w,D)

A∗ = argmaxw∈CP (w|D, Q)

where (cid:12) denotes the multiplication operator to model the interactions between di and qi. Then, the
document contextual representation ˜Hd = {x1, x2, . . . , xk} is gated by query representation.

Suppose the network has K layers. At each layer, the document representation ˜Hd is updated through
above attention learning. After going through all the layers, our model comes to answer prediction phase.
We use all the words in the document to form the candidate set C. Let qt denote the t-th intermediate
output of query representation Hq and HD represent the full output of document representation ˜Hd. The
probability of each candidate word w ∈ C as being the answer is predicted using a softmax layer over
the inner-product between qt and HD.

where vector p denotes the probability distribution over all the words in the document. Note that each
word may occur several times in the document. Thus, the probabilities of each candidate word occurring
in different positions of the document are summed up for ﬁnal prediction.

where I(w, d) denotes the set of positions that a particular word w occurs in the document D. The
training objective is to maximize log P (A|D, Q) where A is the correct answer.

Finally, the candidate word with the highest probability will be chosen as the predicted answer.

Different from recent work employing complex attention mechanisms (Wang et al., 2017b; Cui et al.,
2017a; Sordoni et al., 2016), our attention mechanism is much more simple with comparable perfor-
mance so that we can focus on the effectiveness of SAW strategies.

3 Experiments

3.1 Dataset and Settings

To verify the effectiveness of our proposed model, we conduct multiple experiments on three Chinese
Machine Reading Comprehension datasets, namely CMRC-2017 (Cui et al., 2017b), People’s Daily
(PD) and Children Fairy Tales (CFT) (Cui et al., 2016)2. In these datasets, a story containing consecutive
sentences is formed as the Document and one of the sentences is either automatically or manually selected
as the Query where one token is replaced by a placeholder to indicate the answer to ﬁll in. Table 1 gives
data statistics. Different from the current cloze-style datasets for English reading comprehension, such
as CBT, Daily Mail and CNN (Hermann et al., 2015), the three Chinese datasets do not provide candidate
answers. Thus, the model has to ﬁnd the correct answer from the entire document.

Besides, we also use the Children’s Book Test (CBT) dataset (Hill et al., 2015) to test the generalization
ability in multi-lingual case. We only focus on subsets where the answer is either a common noun (CN)

2Note that the test set of CMRC-2017 and human evaluation test set (Test-human) of CFT are harder for the machine to
answer because the questions are further processed manually and may not be accordance with the pattern of automatic questions.

or NE which is more challenging since the answer is likely to be rare words. We evaluate all the models
in terms of accuracy, which is the standard evaluation metric for this task.

Throughout this paper, we use the same model setting to make fair comparisons. According to our
preliminary experiments, we report the results based on the following settings. The default integration
strategy is element-wise product. Word embeddings were 200d and pre-trained by word2vec (Mikolov
et al., 2013) toolkit on Wikipedia corpus3. Subword embedding were 100d and randomly initialized
with the uniformed distribution in the interval [-0:05; 0:05]. Our model was implemented using the
Theano4 and Lasagne Python libraries5. We used stochastic gradient descent with ADAM updates for
optimization (Kingma and Ba, 2014). The batch size was 64 and the initial learning rate was 0.001 which
was halved every epoch after the second epoch. We also used gradient clipping with a threshold of 10
to stabilize GRU training (Pascanu et al., 2013). We use three attention layers for all experiments. The
GRU hidden units for both the word and subword representation were 128. The default frequency ﬁlter
proportion was 0.9 and the default merging times of BPE was 1,000. We also apply dropout between
layers with a dropout rate of 0.5 6.

3.2 Main Results

CMRC-2017 Table 2 shows our results on CMRC-2017 dataset, which shows that our SAW Reader
(mul) outperforms all other single models on the test set, with 7.57% improvements compared with
Attention Sum Reader (AS Reader) baseline. Although WHU’s model achieves the best besides our
model on the valid set with only 0.75% below ours, their result on the test set is lower than ours by
2.27%, indicating our model has a satisfactory generalization ability.

We also list different integration operations for word and subword embeddings. Table 3 shows the
comparisons. From the results, we can see that Word + BPE outperforms Word + Char which indicates
subword embedding works essentially. We also observe that mul outperforms the other two operations,
concat and sum. This reveals that mul might be more informative than concat and sum operations. The
superiority might be due to element-wise product being capable of modeling the interactions and elimi-
nating distribution differences between word and subword embedding. Intuitively, this is also similar to
endow subword-aware “attention” over the word embedding. In contrast, concatenation operation may
cause too high dimension, which leads to serious over-ﬁtting issues, and sum operation is too simple to
prevent from detailed information losing.

PD & CFT Since there is no training set for CFT dataset, our model is trained on PD training set.
Note that the CFT dataset is harder for the machine to answer because the test set is further processed
by human evaluation, and may not be accordance with the pattern of PD dataset. The results on PD and
CFT datasets are listed in Table 4. As we see that, our SAW Reader signiﬁcantly outperforms the CAS
Reader in all types of testing, with improvements of 7.0% on PD and 8.8% on CFT test sets, respectively.
Although the domain and topic of PD and CFT datasets are quite different, the results indicate that our
model also works effectively for out-of-domain learning.

CBT To verify if our method can only work for Chinese, we also evaluate the effectiveness of the
proposed method on benchmark English dataset. We use CBT dataset as our testbed to evaluate the
performance. For a fair comparison, we simply set the same parameters as before. Table 5 shows
the results. We observe that our model outperforms most of the previously public works, with 2.4 %
gains on the CBT-NE test set compared with GA Reader which adopts word and character embedding
concatenation. Our SAW Reader also achieves comparable performance with FG Reader who adopts
neural gates to combine word-level and character-level representations with assistance of extra features
including NE, POS and word frequency while our model is much simpler and faster. This result shows
our SAW Reader is not restricted to Chinese reading comprehension, but also for other languages.

4 Analysis

4.1 Merging Times of BPE

The vocabulary size could seriously involve the segmentation granularity. For BPE segmentation, the
resulted subword vocabulary size is equal to the merging times plus the number of single-character types.
To have an insight of the inﬂuence, we adopt merge times from 0 to 20k, and conduct quantitative study
on CMRC-2017 for BPE segmentation. Figure 2 shows the results. We observe that when the vocabulary
size is 1k, the models could obtain the best performance. The results indicate that for a task like reading
comprehension the subwords, being a highly ﬂexible grained representation between character and word,
tends to be more like characters instead of words. However, when the subwords completely fall into
characters, the model performs the worst. This indicates that the balance between word and character
is quite critical and an appropriate grain of character-word segmentation could essentially improve the
word representation.

ulary size of BPE.

ence of the short list.

4.2 Filter Mechanism

To investigate the impact of the short list to the model performance, we conduct quantitative study on the
ﬁlter ratio from [0.1, 0.2, . . . , 1]. The results on the CMRC-2017 dataset are depicted in Figure 3. As
we can see that when γ = 0.9 our SAW reader can obtain the best performance, showing that building
the vocabulary among all the training set is not optimal and properly reducing the frequency ﬁlter ratio
can boost the accuracy. This is partially attributed to training the model from the full vocabulary would
cause serious over-ﬁtting as the rare words representations can not obtain sufﬁcient tuning. If the rare
words are not initialized properly, they would also bias the whole word representations. Thus a model
without OOV mechanism will fail to precisely represent those inevitable OOV words from test sets.

4.3 Subword-Augmented Representations

In text understanding tasks, if the ground-truth answer is OOV word or contains OOV word(s), the per-
formance of deep neural networks would severely drop due to the incomplete representation, especially
for cloze-style reading comprehension task where the answer is only one word or phrase. In CMRC-
2017, we observe questions with OOV answers (denoted as “OOV questions”) account for 17.22% in the
error results of the best Word + Char embedding based model. With BPE subword embedding, 12.17%
of these “OOV questions” could be correctly answered. This shows the subword representations could
be essentially useful for modeling rare and unseen words.

To analyze the reading process of SAW Reader, we draw the attention distributions at intermediate

layers as shown in Figure 4. We observe the salient candidates in the document can be focused after the
pair-wise matching of document and query and the right answer (“The mole”) could obtain a high weight
at the very beginning. After attention learning, the key evidence of the answer would be collected and
irrelevant parts would be ignored. This shows our SAW Reader is effective at selecting the vital points
at the fundamental embedding layer, guiding the attention layers to collect more relevant pieces.

5 Related Work

5.1 Machine Reading Comprehension

Recently, many deep learning models have been proposed for reading comprehension (Sordoni et al.,
2016; Trischler et al., 2016; Wang and Jiang, 2016; Munkhdalai and Yu, 2017; Wang et al., 2017a;
Dhingra et al., 2017; Zhang et al., 2018b; Wang et al., 2018b). Notably, Chen et al. (2016) conducted
an in-depth and thoughtful examination on the comprehension task based on an attentive neural network
and an entity-centric classiﬁer with a careful analysis based on handful features. Kadlec et al. (2016)
proposed the Attention Sum Reader (AS Reader) that uses attention to directly pick the answer from the
context, which is motivated by the Pointer Network (Vinyals et al., 2015). Instead of summing the atten-
tion of query-to-document, GA Reader (Dhingra et al., 2017) deﬁned an element-wise product to endow-
ing attention on each word of the document using the entire query representation to build query-speciﬁc
representations of words in the document for accurate answer selection. Wang et al. (2017b) employed
gated self-matching networks (R-net) on passage against passage itself to reﬁne passage representation
with information from the whole passage. Cui et al. (2017a) introduced an “attended attention” mecha-
nism (AoA) where query-to-document and document-to-query are mutually attentive and interactive to
each other.

5.2 Augmented Word Embedding

Distributed word representation plays a fundamental role in neural models (Cai and Zhao, 2016; Qin
et al., 2016; Zhao et al., 2017; Peters et al., 2018; He et al., 2018; Wang et al., 2018a; Bai and Zhao,
2018; Zhang et al., 2018a). Recently, character embeddings are widely used to enrich word representa-
tions (Kim et al., 2016; Yang et al., 2017; Luong and Manning, 2016; Huang et al., 2018). Yang et al.
(2017) explored a ﬁne-grained gating mechanism (FG Reader) to dynamically combine word-level and
character-level representations based on properties of the words. However, this method is computation-
ally complex and it is not end-to-end, requiring extra labels such as NE and POS tags. Seo et al. (2017)

concatenated the character and word embedding to feed a two-layer Highway Network.

Not only for machine reading comprehension tasks, character embedding has also beneﬁt other natural
language process tasks, such as word segmentation (Cai et al., 2017), machine translation (Luong and
Manning, 2016), tagging (Yang et al., 2016; Li et al., 2018) and language modeling (Verwimp et al.,
2017; Miyamoto and Cho, 2016). However, character embedding only shows marginal improvement
due to a lack internal semantics. Lexical, syntactic and morphological information are also considered
to improve word representation (Cao and Rei, 2016; Bergmanis and Goldwater, 2017). Bojanowski et
al. (2017) proposed to learn representations for character n-gram vectors and represent words as the sum
of the n-gram vectors. Avraham and Goldberg (2017) built a model inspired by (Joulin et al., 2017),
who used morphological tags instead of n-grams. They jointly trained their morphological and semantic
embeddings, implicitly assuming that morphological and semantic information should live in the same
space. However, the linguistic knowledge resulting subwords, typically, morphological sufﬁx, preﬁx or
stem, may not be suitable for different kinds of languages and tasks. Sennrich et al. (2016) introduced
the byte pair encoding (BPE) compression algorithm into neural machine translation for being capable
of open-vocabulary translation by encoding rare and unknown words as subword units.
Instead, we
consider reﬁning the word representations for both frequent and infrequent words from a computational
perspective. Our proposed subword-augmented embedding approach is more general, which can be
adopted to enhance the representation for each word by adaptively altering the segmentation granularity
in multiple NLP tasks.

6 Conclusion

This paper presents an effective neural architecture, called subword-augmented word embedding to en-
hance the model performance for the cloze-style reading comprehension task. The proposed SAW Reader
uses subword embedding to enhance the word representation and limit the word frequency spectrum to
train rare words efﬁciently. With the help of the short list, the model size will also be reduced together
with training speedup. Unlike most existing works, which introduce either complex attentive architec-
tures or many manual features, our model is much more simple yet effective. Giving state-of-the-art
performance on multiple benchmarks, the proposed reader has been proved effective for learning joint
representation at both word and subword level and alleviating OOV difﬁculties.
