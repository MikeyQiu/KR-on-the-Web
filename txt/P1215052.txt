Abstract—Objective: Acute intracranial hypertension is an
important risk factor of secondary brain damage after trau-
matic brain injury. Hypertensive episodes are often diagnosed
reactively, leading to late detection and lost time for intervention
planning. A pro-active approach that predicts critical events
several hours ahead of time could assist in directing attention to
patients at risk. Approach: We developed a prediction framework
that forecasts onsets of acute intracranial hypertension in the
next 8 hours. It jointly uses cerebral auto-regulation indices,
spectral energies and morphological pulse metrics to describe
the neurological state of the patient. One-minute base windows
were compressed by computing signal metrics, and then stored
in a multi-scale history, from which physiological features were
derived. Main results: Our model predicted events up to 8
hours in advance with alarm recall rates of 90% at a precision
improving
of 30.3% in the MIMIC-III waveform database,
upon two baselines from the literature. We found that features
derived from high-frequency waveforms substantially improved
the prediction performance over simple statistical summaries of
low-frequency time series, and each of the three feature classes
contributed to the performance gain. The inclusion of long-term
history up to 8 hours was especially important. Signiﬁcance:
Our results highlight the importance of information contained in
high-frequency waveforms in the neurological intensive care unit.
They could motivate future studies on pre-hypertensive patterns
and the design of new alarm algorithms for critical events in the
injured brain.

I. INTRODUCTION
With at least 10 million cases annually leading to hospital-
ization worldwide, traumatic brain injury (TBI), often causing
intracranial hemorrhage, is a major public health issue [1].
After initial admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) and
assessment of the primary brain injury, further neurological
damage often occurs. This phenomenon is referred to as sec-
ondary brain injury, and often leads to long-term brain damage
through e.g. cerebral ischemia (decrease of blood ﬂow to the
brain) [2], cerebral hypoxia (decrease of substrate/oxygen ﬂow
to the brain) [3] and brain herniation (swelling leading to
compression of brain structures [4]).

Management of TBI patients in the neurological ICU fo-
cuses on mitigating and possibly reversing secondary injuries
[5]. A key variable in the management of secondary brain
injury is intracranial pressure (ICP) [6, 7]. Cerebral compli-
ance maintains blood- and energy substrate ﬂow by holding
pressure constant against slight volume changes of the cranial
components [8]. The ICP value of a healthy adult is maintained
by this mechanism in the range 7-15 mmHg [9]. However,
if compliance is reduced, rapid non-linear ICP elevations can
occur [10]. A sustained ICP elevation over 20 mmHg is deﬁned
as acute intracranial hypertension (ICH) [11]. An illustrative
example of an ICH event is shown in Fig. 1.

The patient exhibits normal ICP values, before deteriorating into intracranial
hypertension (ICH, boxes on rug plot). At the end of the trace the patient
returns to a normal ICP state. The horizontal red line denotes the threshold
deﬁning ICH.

A direct association of time spent in the ICH state with
clinical outcome has been empirically shown: The area under
the ICP curve in the ﬁrst 48 hours of ICU treatment is an
independent predictor of in-hospital mortality [12]. Various
other studies have established an association of ICH and poor
neurological outcome [13]–[15]. Accordingly, it is a common
treatment goal in neuro-critical care to avoid acute intracranial
hypertension [7]. Invasive, intra-parenchymal ICP monitor-
ing combined with interventions such as external ventricular
drainage or surgery is the gold standard to control and maintain
ICP in the physiological range of 7-15 mmHg and ensure
adequate cerebral compliance [9]. Advances in monitoring and
signal processing technology have allowed to record high-
frequency ICP traces and analyze them in real-time [16].
Yet there are several caveats that hinder the interpretation

of the ICP signal and its use as a decision-support
tool:
(a) raw data and time-varying trends are presented to the
clinician, and no risk estimates for ICH are available. This can
lead to information overload and over-consumption of human
attention for the ICU personell. For example, a study has
found that clinicians are often not conﬁdent that effort spent
on inspection of ICP traces is redeemed by improving outcome
after TBI [17]; (b) threshold-based track-and-trigger systems
usually have too high false alarm rates, which can desensitize
staff to dangerous hypertension events [18]; (c) alarms are only
triggered after onset of acute intracranial hypertension, when
long-term effects might be harder to prevent.

To address these problems, robust forecasting of ICH onsets
could augment the current treatment protocol which is reactive
in nature. Previous works have shown that complex precur-
sor patterns occur in auto-regulation indices and ICP/ABP
waveform morphology prior to hypertensive events [19, 20].
Recently, simple prediction models explicitly targeting ICH
forecasting 30 minutes up to 6 hours before the event were
proposed, yielding promising results [21]–[23]. However, it is
not well understood or investigated which of these approaches
is necessary or sufﬁcient to achieve high prediction perfor-
mance in the context of an early warning system for ICH,
and whether additional beneﬁts could be derived from their
combination.

In this extensive empirical study of ICH prediction we make

the following contributions

• An online ICH prediction framework which describes
the neurological state using multi-scale metrics of the
last 8 hours of recordings, comprising classical statistical
features, cerebral auto-regulation indices, frequency band
energies and ICP/ABP pulse morphology computed on
high-frequency waveforms. The resulting model is shown
to outperform two baseline models from the literature in
a controlled comparison.

• By including a wide range of relevant channels and
physiological feature types, we conduct
the ﬁrst sys-
tematic study of ICH prediction across signal channels
and feature types, and thereby benchmark various pre-
hypertensive patterns exploited or hypothesized in previ-
ous works.

• We demonstrate clear performance beneﬁts when includ-
ing morphological and spectral energy features derived
from high-frequency waveforms compared to focusing
on only statistical metrics on low-frequency time series
which have been often used in major recent works.

• Using the state-of-the-art feature attribution technique
SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanation) we study the
importance and generate rankings of different features
that explain positive intracranial hypertension alarms,
representing the ﬁrst application of this technique to an
extensive set of pre-hypertensive patterns.

Preliminary and partial versions of this work have been

reported in clinical abstracts [24, 25].

II. RELATED WORK
The association of information contained in high-frequency
physiological waveforms/time series and elevated ICP has

2

been studied in various works. For example, Hornero et al.
[26] have found that decreased ICP signal complexity and
irregularity is associated with intracranial hypertension. Fan
et al. [27] identiﬁed an association between ICP variability
and decreased pressure auto-regulation. Recently, it was es-
tablished that characteristic patterns in various physiological
channels are correlated with ICP and could thus be used to
predict ICH [28]. Several auto-regulation indices deﬁned on
physiological channels were reported, such as by Zeiler et
al.
[29], which studied the moving correlation coefﬁcient
between ICP, ABP and CPP channels, and others [30, 31]. The
relationship between auto-regulation indices and successive
ICH events has been studied by Kim et al. [32]. In general,
it has long been suspected that the information contained in
the pulsatile ICP signal is very rich beyond simple statistical
summaries [33, 34].

Besides auto-regulation indices, previous works have at-
tempted to use morphological descriptors of the intracranial
pressure pulse to predict ICH onset up to 20 minutes in
advance [20, 35, 36]. More generally, morphological analysis
of ICP pulses [37] has emerged as a successful approach
and was used to e.g. reduce false alarm rates of ICP alarms
[38] and track pulse metrics in real-time [39]. Hu et al. [40]
applied cluster analysis to individual ICP pulses. Other types
of features that have been proposed to summarize physiolog-
ical time series include bag-of-words of physiological motifs
applied to ECG/EEG time series [41] and entropy measures
[42, 43]. The recently proposed ICP trajectories framework
[44] uses longitudinal ICP time series to discover clinical
phenotypes. Different approaches have also been proposed,
based on assessing risk only from static clinical data [45] or
biomarkers [46]–[48], instead of using historical time series.

To obviate the need for explicit feature engineering on
historical time series, deep learning architectures have been
proposed, which detect
intracranial hypertension from the
raw pulse waveform [49]. Simpler dimensionality reduction
approaches, such as principal component analysis, have also
been used to ﬁnd non-correlated features [50] that describe
ICH.

Major recent works explicitly addressing the ICH fore-
casting problem include the approach proposed by G¨uiza et
al. [22], which obtained an AUROC of 0.87 for prediction
of ICH in the next 30 minutes. Their analysis showed that
the most predictive channel is ICP and that the most recent
measurements are the most relevant features. Subsequently,
their model was externally validated, resulting in similar
performance [23]. Myers et al. [21] proposed a model that
is able to predict ICH up to 6 hours in advance, a prediction
horizon comparable to our method. It uses simple features such
as the last measured ICP value or the time to the last ICH
crisis. Besides tackling the classiﬁcation task directly, other
models have been suggested that predict the future ICP mean
value, for example by using nearest-neighbor regression [51],
neural networks [52, 53] or ARIMA models [54].

A. Physiological database

III. METHODS

In all experiments, we have used the multi-parameter in-
telligent monitoring in intensive care III waveform database
(MIMIC-III WFDB) [55], Version 1.0. The entire dataset
consists of 67,830 records extracted from patient stays at
the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Boston, MA,
United States. The MIMIC-III WFDB was chosen for this
study because it contains simultaneous measurements of high-
frequency waveforms (125 Hz) and derived time series (1 Hz)
for a range of physiological channels that are relevant to the
prediction problem. Among all available channels, we selected
ICP (mean intracranial pressure) , CPP (cerebral perfusion
pressure), ABPm/d/s (mean/diastolic/systolic arterial blood
pressures), and HR (heart rate) time series, and wICP (in-
tracranial pressure), wABP (invasive arterial blood pressure),
wPLETH (raw output of ﬁngertip plethysmograph), wRESP
(respiration waveform) and ECG waveforms (Fig. 3a). This
broad range allows us to compare the relevance of different
channels for predictive modeling, while ensuring that we
can extract a cohort of at least 100 ICU recordings with
regular sampling. Waveforms were acquired using the bedside
IntelliVue Patient Monitoring system, Philips Healthcare, The
Netherlands.

B. Cohort selection

Only a small fraction of available records in the MIMIC-
III WFDB contain ICP data. In a ﬁrst step, we discarded all
segments that have no available ICP time series, which left
1586 relevant segments. We further require a minimum record-
ing length of 24 hours, and a missing value ratio of at most
25% for each considered waveform or time series channel.
We applied these criteria to ensure that the relevance of dif-
ferent channels as features could be meaningfully compared,
and individual channels would not be negatively affected by
long stretches of missing data. After applying these criteria,
123 segments remained in the cohort. This set of recording
segments was used in all reported experiments. A diagram
summarizing patient exclusions and cohort deﬁnition is shown
in Fig. 2. Matching to MIMIC-III clinical database records was
only possible for 66 of the 123 segments, contributed by 50
unique patients, for which clinical context is provided in Table
I. In terms of admission diagnosis, the cohort is homogeneous,
with most patients exhibiting intracranial hemorrhage. In this
work, we did not include clinical covariates into the processing
pipeline to avoid unequal treatment of segments or a signiﬁcant
reduction of available segments. Overall, our data-set contains
10,547 hours of data (Fig. 3a). Each segment has a mean
recording length of 85.8 hours (std: 54.8 hours). The mean
ICP value in the cohort is 9.1 mmHg (std: 6.8 mmHg).

C. Acute intracranial hypertension alarms

We deﬁne an ICH event as 5 successive 1-minute blocks
with median ICP greater than 20 mmHg, which helps to avoid
spurious labelings, following the recent work by Ziai et al.
[56], the earlier work by Hu et al. [20], and the deﬁnition of

sustained ICH from [57]. According to this deﬁnition, patients
were in an acute ICH event state for 2.5% of their cumulative
segment lengths. When analyzed by segment, the ICH state
was active for a mean of 2.0% (std: 7.3%) of each segment’s
duration. A time point on the 1-minute grid was labeled as
positive if there is any acute intracranial hypertension event
in the next 8 hours and the patient is not already hypertensive
(Fig. 3b). This strategy implements an early warning system
deployed in phases where the patient has normal ICP values.
Our design choice was to train one overall model for predicting
events in the next 8 hours, without targeting any speciﬁc
prediction horizon. Positive labels correspond to time points at
which an alarm should be produced by our prediction model
(Fig. 3b). Recall is deﬁned as the fraction of those points,
at which an alarm is indeed produced. Precision denotes the
fraction of produced alarms which are in the 8 hours prior
to some ICH event (Fig. 3g). Both metrics are maximized if

continuous sequences of alarms are produced exactly in the
8 hours before events, one for each grid point. However, in
clinical implementation this strict condition could be relaxed

by applying post-processing such as moving window functions
over the sequence of thresholded prediction scores. We con-
sider such processing to be out-of-scope here, but we suspect it

can improve practical alarm system performance signiﬁcantly,
both in terms of recall and false alarm rate. There were a total
of 555,644 labeled 1-minute time points, of which 117,954
were positive, and 437,690 negative.

D. Physiological feature extraction framework

Basic block functions: During the feature generation pro-
cess, so-called basic block functions are computed online
on non-overlapping windows containing 1 minute of high-
frequency waveforms/time series, corresponding to 60 samples
@1 Hz or 7500 samples @125 Hz (Fig. 3d). The choice
of 1 minute as a basic interval makes computation of com-
plex morphological functions tractable, increases robustness
to signal artifacts and sensor detachments, and allows to
produce updated predictions every minute. Before computing
basic block functions, a window is pre-processed by removing
physiologically implausible values. If at
least half of the
samples are valid, we reconstruct the remaining samples by
linear interpolation. Otherwise, invalid basic blocks marked by
a symbolic value are emitted (Fig. 3c). Basic block functions
are then computed on valid blocks. As basic block functions
we have considered statistical/complexity summaries (me-
dian, interquartile range(IQR), line length, Shannon entropy),
spectral band energies of waveforms, morphological pulse
summaries of the wABP and the wICP waveforms, as well as
cerebral auto-regulation indices. Morphological pulse metrics
are computed by an algorithm consisting of several steps (Fig.
3d). First, individual pulses on wABP/wICP are segmented,
using variants of known algorithms [58]–[60], with the help of
the ECG waveform as a reference to identify pulse onsets. Valid
pulses in the window are then temporally scaled to make their
lengths comparable, overlaid and averaged point-wise, yielding
an averaged pulse. Morphological pulse metrics, modeled on
those described by Hu et al. [20] and Almeida et al. [61], are
then computed on the averaged pulse. A complete overview
of the basic block functions is provided in Table II.

Multi-scale history: Computed basic block features are
appended to a history buffer using an online algorithm, with
one batch of features appended per minute (Fig. 3e). If a
block is invalid or some features cannot be computed, for
example due to missing signals, they are forward ﬁlled from
the last valid feature in the history. If there is no valid feature
in the recent past, the feature value is set to the median of
that feature value in the accumulated history. After the history
buffer is updated, a new sample of machine learning features
is emitted by summarizing the current state of the history
buffer (Fig. 3e). As summary functions, we use the median
(location estimate of a basic feature over the history), IQR
(variability of a basic feature over the history) and the slope
of regression line ﬁt (trend of a basic feature over the history).
These summary functions are applied separately over the last
15, 30, 60, 120, 240, 360 and 480 minutes to capture pre-
hypertensive patterns at various scales of the feature buffer
history. After the full feature matrix is built, we standardize
all feature columns to have zero mean and unit standard
deviation, using statistics from the training data-set. Missing
values are replaced by zero, which corresponds to global mean

imputation. For machine learning models that can deal with
missing data natively, like decision trees or tree ensembles,
missing data imputation/normalization was not performed. The
online signal processing and feature generation algorithms
were implemented using the numerical packages SciPy and
NumPy in Python 3.6.

E. Feature interpretation using SHAP values

To gain insights into the precursor patterns of intracranial
hypertension we have used SHAP value analysis [69] to
uncover the most important features that explain ICH pre-
dictions. SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanation values) is a
local feature attribution method, which attributes risk scores
of future intracranial hypertension to individual signal patterns,
encoded in the physiological features. The SHAP value of a
feature xi = k is the expected change of the risk score, when
this feature is added to update the risk estimate, integrating
over all possible subsets of other variables which are already
used in the risk estimate, prior to adding the new variable.
The SHAP value of a prediction at x for feature i is deﬁned
as si,x := ES[E[f (x)|xS∪{i}] − E[f (x)|xS]]. Here f denotes
the risk score, E[f (x)|xS] the conditional expectation of the
risk score if the values of features in S are ﬁxed to their
observed values, and ES[·] the expectation over the choice of
ﬁxed features S. The used TreeSHAP algorithm [70] is an
implementation of SHAP values for tree ensembles, which can
deal with missing values, and hence simpliﬁes the computa-
tions of si,x. We summarized SHAP values of predictions on
the validation set by deﬁning the global importance of a feature

(cid:80)

:= n−1
val

as gi
x∈val |si,x|, as the mean magnitude of risk
score change that a particular feature causes when introduced
into the model (Fig. 3f). Hereby, nval is the number of samples
in the validation set. All features were ranked by {gi} for
each split, deﬁning the top features of the split. Ranks were
averaged across splits to increase robustness of the reported
feature rankings (Fig. 3g). SHAP values were also used as a
feature selection method internal to each split, by discarding
all but the top 100 features on the validation set before creating
derived models (Fig. 3g). In this way, overﬁtting to non-
informative features, which are numerous due to the broad
range of feature combinations, is reduced. The test set was
not used for feature selection or feature ranking purposes.

F. Machine learning models

As machine learning models we have considered LogReg,
a L2-regularized logistic regression model optimized using
stochastic gradient descent [71]; Tree, a single decision tree;
GradBoost, a gradient-boosted ensemble of decision trees
[72]; and MLP, a multi-layer perceptron with a sigmoid acti-
vation function. Implementation details and hyper-parameter
search grids for all machine learning models are listed in the
supplementary material.

G. Experimental design

Prediction models were evaluated using precision @75 and
@90% recall, which reﬂects our prior belief that an alarm
system for ICH should have high sensitivity, whereas false
alarms are more tolerable and can be reduced with post-
processing deﬁned on top of the sequence of prediction scores
(Fig. 3g). All experimental result tables report these 2 metrics
as well as areas under the PR curve. 95% standard-error-based
conﬁdence intervals of performance metrics, which are used in
all ﬁgures/tables, were constructed by drawing 10 randomized
train/validation/test splits (proportion 40:20:40%) with respect
to complete recording segments. Splits were stratiﬁed, such
that the positive label prevalence of training, validation, test
sets in each split is within 0.015 of the overall prevalence in
the cohort. This minimizes nuisance effects for performance
metrics sensitive to label prevalence (e.g. precision). The
experiments performed per split are completely independent.
The training set was used for model ﬁtting, while the validation
set was used for choosing the optimal set of hyperparameters,
and computing mean absolute SHAP values that deﬁne the
reported feature rankings (Fig. 3f). Each split is associated
with a distinct feature ranking, which we integrate over in the
feature importance analysis (Fig. 3h). The test set was used
to compute all reported performance metrics; hyperparameters
and optimal features were not selected on this set to avoid
overﬁtting. To account for test set variability, besides training
process variability, we drew 100 bootstrap samples (size 50%
of test-set samples) with replacement from the test set, yielding
1000 overall replicates. Models with (indistinguishable based
on overlapping 95% conﬁdence intervals) best performance
are listed in bold-face.

Low-frequency time series channels

IV. RESULTS

As a sanity check, we trained several models that do not
use any features derived from high-frequency waveforms. The
results, shown in the ﬁrst part of Table III, indicate that ICP
is the single most valuable time series across all desired recall
levels. The addition of ABP/CPP context information leads to
consistent performance increases for most evaluation metrics.

Importance of high-frequency waveform metrics

Taking the most performant time series model (from the
ﬁrst part of Table III), we tested whether adding features
derived from 125 Hz waveforms has a positive effect on
the prediction performance (second part of Table III). Our
results indicate that adding wICP yields a marked performance
increase, and the joint use with wABP strengthens this effect
slightly. Using only waveform channels shows consistently
higher performance than just using time series.

Morphological, spectral energy metrics and cerebral auto-
regulation indices

Morphological pulse metrics, cerebral auto-regulation in-
dices and band energy have each been shown to exhibit charac-
teristic changes before hypertensive events in prior work. We
tested whether such changes can translate into performance
beneﬁts when the corresponding features are added to a simple
model. Our results are summarized in the ﬁrst part of Table IV.
Incremental additions of feature categories (ordered roughly
by computational cost and algorithmic complexity) lead to
consistent performance increases across all desired recalls.

Multi-scale history summary modes

It has been reported in the literature that variability or trends
of individual metrics are predictive of ICH events. Using
different history buffer summary functions, we tested whether
such features are indeed valuable vs. location estimates. Our
results, listed in the second part of Table IV, suggest that
adding trend/variability functions to the multi-scale history
provides beneﬁts.

How much history do we need to store?

Given the beneﬁts of complex waveform features, it is still
unclear whether informative changes in pre-hypertensive pat-
terns occur during the short- or also long-term history before
the event. We tried to answer this question by ablating the
set of multi-scale summary functions supported by our frame-
work. Our results (Fig. 4) indicate that there seem to be no
clear saturation effects when adding averages/trends/variability
over additional length scales until a history length of 6 hours,
when performance saturates.

In a last step, we evaluated different machine learning
methods ﬁtted on the optimal features and compared with two
baselines from the literature in Tables V and VI. We simulated
the method of Hu et al. [20] (BL1: ICP morphology)
by computing medians of ICP pulse morphology metrics in
the last 15 and 30 minutes, which is similar to their pre-
hypertensive segment features. A second baseline implements
the recently proposed method by Myers et al. [21] (BL2: Last

7

2 points + Time to last crisis) which uses as the three features
the last 2 ICP values in a 30 minute window and the time
since the last ICH event. If there was no such event, the last
feature was set to a large symbolic value. Results show that
the simplest machine learning model, i.e. LogReg, performed
the best, while more complicated models like neural networks
(MLP) or tree-based methods (Tree/GradBoost) provided
no improvements. N/A is shown in Table V if the recall could
not be achieved by a machine learning method in all splits. Our
proposed model signiﬁcantly outperformed the two baselines,
both for PR-based and ROC-based metrics that emphasive high
sensitivities.

Ranking of most important physiological metrics

By computing mean absolute SHAP values on the validation
set in all 10 splits, we obtained a joint ranking of importance
of individual physiological metrics. The 20 most important
features for predicting ICH are listed in Table VII. Features
that have identical signatures but are computed over distinct
scales, are not repeated. Instead, scales that belong to the top
100 features overall are listed in the last column. Features
among the top 100 for special feature categories are listed
in Tables IX (wICP/wABP waveform) and X (auto-regulation
indices).

As a complementary analysis to feature ablation, we also
analyzed which feature categories provided important features

according to rankings of mean absolute SHAP values. To en-
able an easier comparison, we computed the fraction of actual
inclusions in the top 100 features (per split) over the number
of theoretically possible inclusions. Results are summarized
in Table VIII. Waveforms contribute more to highly ranked
features than time series, both in absolute and relative terms. In
addition, several important features are auto-regulation indices,
spectral energies or morphological summaries. Finally, long-
scale history summaries between 4 and 8 hours also provide
many highly ranked features.

Alarm timeliness before events

The performance of the proposed model for a precision of
35% is shown in Fig. 5. To provide more insights into the
behavior of a derived alarm system in clinical settings, we have
analyzed the recall of desired alarms before events, conditional
on the time until the ICH phase starts. This measures the
timeliness of alarms given a ﬁxed model with a constant
overall false alarm rate, which is a realistic scenario of clinical
implementation. We can observe a modest decay of alarm

recall rates in the proposed model, which stay above 70%
even 8 hours prior to the event.

V. DISCUSSION

We have designed and evaluated a prediction framework
for acute intracranial hypertension events, which describes
the neurological state using multi-scale descriptors of cerebral

autoregulation indices, pulse morphology metrics, spectral en-
ergies and statistical summaries. Alarms before critical events
were retrieved up to 8 hours before the onset of ICH (Figure
5) with an overall recall of 90 % at a precision of 30.3 %.
By mainly analyzing the system using recall/precision we have
chosen metrics that more easily translate to the clinical deploy-
ment of alarm systems than ROC-based metrics. The achieved
AUROC score of 0.771 for 8h forecasting is comparable to the
work of Myers et al. [21], which is to our knowledge the only
published work with a similar forecasting horizon of 6 hours.
Yet, direct comparison is not easily possible due to differences
in cohort size (123 vs. 817 segments) and label deﬁnitions. In
this work, we implemented the method in [21] to enable a
controlled comparison on the same dataset, see Table VI.

Limitations of our study include the inability to match all
123 recording segments to the MIMIC-III clinical database,
and hence take clinical context information into account for
label and experimental split deﬁnition. With respect to labels,
by not taking clinical interventions into account, we suspect
that we are predicting cases of acute intracranial hypertension
that care providers did not anticipate in time before the patient
entered the ICH state, which corresponds to scenarios where
an early warning system is used as a complementary decision
support tool. To analyze this effect in detail, prospectively
collected data which documents all clinical interventions and
provides contextual information on the ICH events would be
required. In our data splits, training, validation and test sets
are guaranteed to be temporally disjoint, without interaction
between labels and clinical features. Focusing on patients that
have comprehensive monitoring with few missing values in
the data-set could bias the cohort towards more intensively
monitored patients. We chose to apply this criterion regardless
because it allows more meaningful conclusions about
the
utility of different feature channels for predictive modeling.

A novel perspective on the design of ICH alarm systems is
provided by the results in Table III. While building a model
just using averaged time series deﬁning the event status (ICP)
provides a good baseline performance, the inclusion of richer
data modalities like waveforms substantially increased perfor-
mance. Including high-frequency context information (wABP)
in addition to wICP increased the performance further. This
hints at new independent information in the ABP waveform
and supports the importance of auto-regulation indices, which
are functions of two waveforms simultaneously. However, data
storage and computational cost associated with waveform data
might be considerable.

To our knowledge, there is no previous work that assesses
the relative merits of different data modalities for ICH pre-
diction. It is an interesting ﬁnding that only using waveforms
performed better than only averaged time series, especially in
light of recent related works, which found high performance
using very simple models, e.g. using only minute-by-minute
summaries of ICP.

Each individual feature category among auto-regulation
indices, spectral energy, pulse morphology metrics provided
marginal performance gains (Table IV) and is relevant for
explaining predictions, as assessed using SHAP values (Table
VIII). This shows that complex pre-hypertensive patterns pre-

9

viously identiﬁed can translate into relevant machine learning
features in our framework.

Our results (Figure 4) show a clear trend between the length
of considered history and prediction performance, which con-
ﬁrms the design principle of the multi-scale history, and also
hints at the relative importance of long-scale physiological
changes before hypertensive events, which could inform clin-
ical studies. The same observation can be derived from the
analysis of feature category importance in Table VIII, where a
clear trend in importance from short-term to long-term features
is visible.

The comparison of machine learning models (Table V) pro-
vides a pragmatic look at the relevance of the exact statistical
learning method for predicting ICH. As has been observed also
for other prediction problems in health care, simple models
perform surprisingly well, and are not outperformed by models
with higher complexity. We suspect that, since the feature
choices already incorporate extensive domain knowledge, a
like logistic regression is powerful enough.
simple model
Given the similar performance of MLP and LogReg, we did
not consider the construction of more complex architectures
like RNNs or CNNs for this study, which are harder to
interpret than classical models, where interpretation of model
features is an important focus of this study.

VI. CONCLUSION

We presented an online machine learning and signal pro-
cessing framework that forecasts onsets of acute intracranial
hypertension up to 8 hours in advance. Using an extensive
series of ablation studies we have shed light on the critical
components of the framework. SHAP value analysis provided
a second perspective on the importance of different feature
categories in explaining predictions as well as a ranking
of discriminative pattern changes before acute intracranial
hypertension. Both perspectives highlight the importance of
information derived from waveforms, which provided a sub-
stantial performance increase. Our method out-performed two
baselines from the literature, which use ICP pulse morphology
and 3 simple features of the ICP time series, respectively.

the block level,

Directions of future work includes more sophisticated ar-
tifact detection methods at
to minimize
the corruption of down-stream feature generation, which is
highly sensitive to accurate input signals. Exploring the per-
sample SHAP values could provide interpretable reasons
for predictions of future ICH events, visualize regions of
interest in the history, ﬂag abnormal physiological indices
that could precede ICH, as well as generate hypotheses for
future studies on the phenomenon. Furthermore, our method
could be extended by providing a calibrated alarm system
on top of the prediction scores, which triggers alarms at the
bedside as a function of sequences of prediction scores. This
would be an important step towards clinical implementation
of our proposed approach, which was conceived as a real-time
algorithm that could directly use data streamed from sensors.
Collecting prospective clinical data to reﬁne the labeling using
information on clinical interventions as well as adding clinical
co-variates like diagnosis or clinical note concepts could, we

suspect, increase the performance of our model even further.
Finally, we expect that our framework could be applied to
predict other critical events occurring in the injured brain.
