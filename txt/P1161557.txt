Abstract

Continuous word representations learned sepa-
rately on distinct languages can be aligned so
that their words become comparable in a com-
mon space. Existing works typically solve a
least-square regression problem to learn a rota-
tion aligning a small bilingual lexicon, and use
a retrieval criterion for inference. In this paper,
we propose an uniﬁed formulation that directly
optimizes a retrieval criterion in an end-to-end
fashion. Our experiments on standard bench-
marks show that our approach outperforms the
state of the art on word translation, with the
biggest improvements observed for distant lan-
guage pairs such as English-Chinese.

Introduction

Previous work has proposed to learn a linear map-
ping between continuous representations of words
by employing a small bilingual lexicon as supervi-
sion. The transformation generalizes well to words
that are not observed during training, making it
possible to extend the lexicon. Another applica-
tion is to transfer predictive models between lan-
guages (Klementiev et al., 2012).

The ﬁrst simple method proposed by Mikolov
et al. (2013b) has been subsequently improved
by changing the problem parametrization. One
successful suggestion is to (cid:96)2–normalize the word
vectors and to constrain the linear mapping to
be orthogonal (Xing et al., 2015). An alignment
is then efﬁciently found using orthogonal Pro-
crustes (Artetxe et al., 2016; Smith et al., 2017),
improving the accuracy on standard benchmarks.

Yet, the resulting models suffer from the so-
called “hubness problem”: some word vectors tend
to be the nearest neighbors of an abnormally high
number of other words. This limitation is now ad-
dressed by applying a corrective metric at inference
time, such as the inverted softmax (ISF) (Smith
et al., 2017) or the cross-domain similarity local

scaling (CSLS) (Conneau et al., 2017). This is
not fully satisfactory because the loss used for in-
ference is not consistent with that employed for
training. This observation suggests that the square
loss is suboptimal and could advantageously be
replaced by a loss adapted to retrieval.

In this paper, we propose a training objective
inspired by the CSLS retrieval criterion. We in-
troduce convex relaxations of the corresponding
objective function, which are efﬁciently optimized
with projected subgradient descent. This loss can
advantageously include unsupervised information
and therefore leverage the representations of words
not occurring in the training lexicon.

Our contributions are as follows. First we in-
troduce our approach and empirically evaluate it
on standard benchmarks for word translation. We
obtain state-of-the-art bilingual mappings for more
than 25 language pairs. Second, we speciﬁcally
show the beneﬁt of our alternative loss function
and of leveraging unsupervised information. Fi-
nally, we show that with our end-to-end formu-
lation, a non-orthogonal mapping achieves better
results. The code for our approach is a part of
the fastText library1 and the aligned vectors are
available on https://fasttext.cc/.

2 Preliminaries on bilingual mappings

This section introduces pre-requisites and prior
works to learn a mapping between two languages,
using a small bilingual lexicon as supervision.

We start from two sets of continuous representa-
tions in two languages, each learned on monolin-
gual data. Let us introduce some notation. Each
word i ∈ {1, . . . , N } in the source language (re-
spectively target language) is associated with a vec-
tor xi ∈ Rd (respectively yi ∈ Rd). For simplicity,

1https://github.com/facebookresearch/

fastText/tree/master/alignment/

we assume that our initial lexicon, or seeds, cor-
responds to the ﬁrst n pairs (xi, yi)i∈{1,...,n}. The
goal is to extend the lexicon to all source words i ∈
{n + 1, . . . , N } that are not seeds. Mikolov et
al. (2013b) learn a linear mapping W ∈ Rd×d be-
tween the word vectors of the seed lexicon that min-
imizes a measure of discrepancy between mapped
word vectors of the source language and word vec-
tors of the target language:

min
W∈Rd×d

1
n

n
(cid:88)

i=1

(cid:96)(Wxi, yi),

(1)

where (cid:96) is a loss function, typically the square loss
(cid:96)2(x, y) = (cid:107)x − y(cid:107)2
2. This leads to a least squares
problem, which is solved in closed form.

Orthogonality. The linear mapping W is con-
strained to be orthogonal, i.e. such that W(cid:62)W =
Id, where Id is the d-dimensional identity ma-
trix. This choice preserves distances between word
vectors, and likewise word similarities. Previous
works (Xing et al., 2015; Artetxe et al., 2016; Smith
et al., 2017) experimentally observed that constrain-
ing the mapping in such a way improves the quality
of the inferred lexicon. With the square loss and
by enforcing an orthogonal mapping W, Eq. (1)
admits a closed form solution (Gower and Dijkster-
huis, 2004): W∗ = UV(cid:62), where UDV(cid:62) is the
singular value decomposition of the matrix Y(cid:62)X.

Inference. Once a mapping W is learned, one
can infer word correspondences for words that are
not in the initial lexicon. The translation t(i) of a
source word i is obtained as

t(i) ∈ arg min
j∈{1,...,N }

(cid:96)(Wxi, yj).

(2)

When the squared loss is used, this amounts to com-
puting Wxi and to performing a nearest neighbor
search with respect to the Euclidean distance:

t(i) ∈ arg min
j∈{1,...,N }

(cid:107)Wxi − yj(cid:107)2
2.

(3)

Hubness. A common observation is that near-
est neighbor search for bilingual lexicon inference
suffers from the “hubness problem” (Doddington
et al., 1998; Dinu et al., 2014). Hubs are words that
appear too frequently in the neighborhoods of other
words. To mitigate this effect, a simple solution is
to replace, at inference time, the square (cid:96)2-norm
in Eq. (3) by another criterion, such as ISF (Smith
et al., 2017) or CSLS (Conneau et al., 2017).

This solution, both with ISF and CSLS criteria,
is applied with a transformation W learned using
the square loss. However, replacing the loss in
Eq. (3) creates a discrepancy between the learning
of the translation model and the inference.

3 Word translation as a retrieval task

In this section, we propose to directly include the
CSLS criterion in the model in order to make learn-
ing and inference consistent. We also show how to
incorporate unsupervised information..

The CSLS criterion is a similarity measure be-

tween the vectors x and y deﬁned as:

CSLS(x, y) = −2 cos(x, y)
1
k

cos(x, y(cid:48))+

(cid:88)

1
k

+

y(cid:48)∈NY (x)

x(cid:48)∈NX (y)

(cid:88)

cos(x(cid:48), y),

where NY (x) is the set of k nearest neighbors
of the point x in the set of target word vec-
tors Y = {y1, . . . , yN }, and cos is the cosine sim-
ilarity. Note, the second term in the expression of
the CSLS loss does not change the neighbors of x.
However, it gives a loss function that is symmet-
rical with respect to its two arguments, which is a
desirable property for training.

Objective function. Let us now write the opti-
mization problem for learning the bilingual map-
ping with CSLS. At this stage, we follow previ-
ous work and constrain the linear mapping W
to belong to the set of orthogonal matrices Od.
Here, we also assume that word vectors are (cid:96)2-
normalized. Under these assumptions, we have
i W(cid:62)yi. Similarly, we have
cos(Wxi, yi) = x(cid:62)
(cid:107)yj − Wxi(cid:107)2
i W(cid:62)yj. Therefore, ﬁnd-
ing the k nearest neighbors of Wxi among the ele-
ments of Y is equivalent to ﬁnding the k elements
of Y which have the largest dot product with Wxi.
We adopt this equivalent formulation because it
leads to a convex formulation when relaxing the
orthogonality constraint on W. In summary, our
optimization problem with the Relaxed CSLS loss
(RCSLS) is written as:

2 = 2 − 2x(cid:62)

min

(4)

Convex relaxation. Eq. (4) involves the min-
imization of a non-smooth cost function over
the manifold of orthogonal matrices Od. As
such, it can be solved using manifold optimiza-
tion tools (Boumal et al., 2014). In this work, we
consider as an alternative to the set Od, its convex
hull Cd, i.e., the unit ball of the spectral norm. We
refer to this projection as the “Spectral” model. We
also consider the case where these constraints on
the alignment matrix are simply removed.

Having a convex domain allows us to reason
about the convexity of the cost function. We ob-
serve that the second and third terms in the CSLS
loss can be rewritten as follows:

(cid:88)

i W(cid:62)yj = max
x(cid:62)
S∈Sk(n)

i W(cid:62)yj,
x(cid:62)

(cid:88)

j∈S

yj ∈Nk(Wxi)

where Sk(n) denotes the set of all subsets of
{1, . . . , n} of size k. This term, seen as a func-
tion of W, is a maximum of linear functions of W,
which is convex (Boyd and Vandenberghe, 2004).
This shows that our objective function is convex
with respect to the mapping W and piecewise lin-
ear (hence non-smooth). Note, our approach could
be generalized to other loss functions by replac-
i W(cid:62)yj by any function convex in
ing the term x(cid:62)
W. We minimize this objective function over the
convex set Cd by using the projected subgradient
descent algorithm.

The projection onto the set Cd is solved by tak-
ing the singular value decomposition (SVD) of the
matrix, and thresholding the singular values to one.

Extended Normalization. Usually, the number
of word pairs in the seed lexicon n is small with
respect to the size of the dictionaries N . To beneﬁt
from unlabeled data, it is common to add an itera-
tive “reﬁnement procedure” (Artetxe et al., 2017)
when learning the translation model W. Given a
model Wt, this procedure iterates over two steps.
First it augments the training lexicon by keeping
the best-inferred translation in Eq. (3). Second it
learns a new mapping Wt+1 by solving the prob-
lem in Eq. (1). This strategy is similar to standard
semi-supervised approaches where the training set
is augmented over time. In this work, we propose
to use the unpaired words in the dictionaries as
“negatives” in the RCSLS loss: instead of comput-
ing the k-nearest neighbors NY (Wxi) amongst
the annotated words {y1, . . . , yn}, we do it over
the whole dictionary {y1, . . . , yN }.

4 Experiments

This section reports the main results obtained with
our method. We provide complementary results
and an ablation study in the appendix. We refer
to our method without constraints as RCSLS and
as RCSLS+spectral if the spectral constraints are
used.

4.1

Implementation details

We choose a learning rate in {1, 10, 25, 50} and
a number of epochs in {10, 20} on the validation
set. For the unconstrained RCSLS, a small (cid:96)2 regu-
larization can be added to prevent the norm of W
to diverge. In practice, we do not use any regular-
ization. For the English-Chinese pairs (en-zh), we
center the word vectors. The number of nearest
neighbors in the CSLS loss is 10. We use the (cid:96)2-
normalized fastText word vectors by Bojanowski
et al. (2017) trained on Wikipedia.

4.2 The MUSE benchmark

Table 9 reports the comparison of RCSLS with stan-
dard supervised and unsupervised approaches on
5 language pairs (in both directions) of the MUSE
benchmark (Conneau et al., 2017). Every approach
uses the Wikipedia fastText vectors and supervi-
sion comes in the form of a lexicon composed of
5k words and their translations. Regardless of the
relaxation, RCSLS outperforms the state of the art
by, on average, 3 to 4% in accuracy. This shows
the importance of using the same criterion during
training and inference. Note that the reﬁnement
step (“reﬁne”) also uses CSLS to ﬁnetune the align-
ments but leads to a marginal gain for supervised
methods.

Interestingly, RCSLS achieves a better perfor-
mance without constraints (+0.8%) for all pairs.
Contrary to observations made in previous works,
this result suggests that preserving the distance be-
tween word vectors is not essential for word trans-
lation. Indeed, previous works used a (cid:96)2 loss where,
indeed, orthogonal constraints lead to an improve-
ment of +5.3% (Procrustes versus Least Square
Error). This suggests that a linear mapping W
with no constraints works well only if it is learned
with a proper criterion.

Impact of extended normalization. Table 2 re-
ports the gain brought by including words not in
the lexicon (unannotated words) to the performance
of RCSLS. Extending the dictionary signiﬁcantly
improves the performance on all language pairs.

4.3 The WaCky dataset

Dinu et al. (2014) introduce a setting where word
vectors are learned on the WaCky datasets (Baroni
et al., 2009) and aligned with a noisy bilingual
lexicon. We select the number of epochs within
{1, 2, 5, 10} on a validation set. Table 3 shows that
RCSLS is on par with the state of the art. RCSLS
is thus robust to relatively poor word vectors and
noisy lexicons.

4.4 Comparison with existing aligned vectors

Recently, word vectors based on fastText have been
aligned and released by Smith et al. (2017, Baby-
lonPartners, BP) and Conneau et al. (2017, MUSE).
Both use a variation of Procrustes to align word
vectors in the same space.

We compare these methods to RCSLS and re-
port results in Table 8. RCSLS improves the perfor-
mance by +3.5% over MUSE vectors when trained
with the same lexicon (Original). Training RSCSL
on the full training lexicon (Full) brings an addi-
tional improvement of +2.9% on average with a
CSLS criterion, and +6.1% with a NN criterion.
For reference, the performance of Procrustes only
improves by +1.4% with CSLS and even degrades
with a NN criterion. RCSLS beneﬁts more from
additional supervision than Procrustes. Finally,

2013a). In Table 4, we report the accuracy on analo-
gies for raw word vectors and our vectors mapped
to English with an alignement trained on the full
MUSE training set. Regardless of the source lan-
guage, the mapping does not negatively impact the
word vectors. Similarly, our alignement has also lit-
tle impact on word similarity, as shown in Table 6.
We conﬁrm this observation by running the re-
verse mapping, i.e., by mapping the English word
vectors of Mikolov et al. (2018) to Spanish. It leads
to an improvement of 1% both for vectors trained
on Common Crawl (85% to 86%) and Wikipedia +
News (87% to 88%).

5 Conclusion

This paper shows that minimizing a convex relax-
ation of the CSLS loss signiﬁcantly improves the
quality of bilingual word vector alignment. We use
a reformulation of CSLS that generalizes to convex
functions beyond dot-products and provides to a
single end-to-end training that is consistent with
the inference stage. Finally, we show that removing
the orthogonality constraint does not degrade the
quality of the aligned vectors.

Figure 1: Accuracy as a function of the training set size
(log scale) on the en-de pair.

Size of training lexicon. Figure 1 compares the
accuracy of RCSLS and Procrustes as a function
of the training set size. On small training sets,
the difference between RCSLS and Procrustes is
marginal but increases with the training set size.

Table 7: Comparison between different functions in
CSLS on four language pairs. Linear is the standard
criterion, while logSumExp is equivalent to a logistic
regression with hard mining.

Comparison of alternative criterions. As dis-
cussed in the main paper,
the dot product in
the CSLS terms can be replaced by any convex
function of W and still yield a convex objec-
tive. Using a logSumExp function, i.e., f (x) =
log((cid:80)
i(exp(xi))) is equivalent to a “local” logis-
tic regression classiﬁer, or equivalently, to a logistic
regression with hard mining. In this experiment,
we train our model using the alternative loss and re-
port the accuracy of the resulting lexicon in Table 7.
We observe that this choice does not signiﬁcantly
changes the performance. This suggests that the
local property of the criterion is more important
than the form of the loss.

Table 8: Comparison with publicly available aligned
vectors, averaged over 28 language pairs. All use su-
pervision. Alignements are learned either on the “Orig-
inal” or “Full” MUSE training. We report performance
with the NN and CSLS criterion on either the full
MUSE test set or without the exact string matches. BP
uses a different training set with 5k words.

Figure 2: Accuracy as a function of the number of near-
est neighbors, averaged over 8 different pairs.

Impact of the number of nearest neighbors.
The CSLS criterion and the RCSLS loss are sensi-
ble to the number of nearest neighbors. Figure 2
shows the impact of this parameter on both Pro-
crustes and RCSLS. Procrustes is impacted through
the retrieval criterion while RCSLS is impacted by
the loss and the criterion. Taking 10 nearest neigh-
bors is optimal and the performance decreases sig-
niﬁcantly with a large number of neighbors.

Exact string matches. The MUSE datasets con-
tains exact string matches based on vocabularies
built on Wikipedia. The matches may reﬂects cor-
rect translations but can come from other sources,
like English word that frequently appears in movie
or song titles. Table 8 compares alignments on
the MUSE test set with and without exact string
matches average over 28 languages. Note that we
do not remove exact matches in the training sets

for fair comparison with MUSE vectors. We note
that the gap between our vectors and others is more
important with an NN criterion. We also observe
that, the performance of all the methods drop when
the exact string matches are removed.

Impact of
the retrieval criterion. Table 9
shows performance on MUSE with a nearest neigh-
bors (NN) criterion. Replacing CSLS by NN leads
to a smaller drops for RCSLS (3%) than for com-
petitors (around 5%), suggesting that RCSLS trans-
fers some local information encoded in the CSLS
criterion to the dot product.

Appendix B Alignment and word vectors

In this appendix, we look at the relation between
the quality of the word vectors and the quality of
an alignment. We measure both the impact of the
vectors on the alignment and the impact of a non-
orthogonal mapping on word vectors.

Impact on English word vectors. We evaluate
the impact of a non-orthogonal mapping on the
English word analogy task (Mikolov et al., 2013a).
Table 11 compares on analogies the raw English
word vectors to their alignments to 4 languages.
Regardless of the target language, the mapping
does not have negative impact on the word vectors.

Table 10: Impact on the alignment of the quality of the
word vectors trained on the same corpora.

Quality of the embedding model.
In this exper-
iment, we study the impact of the quality of the
word vectors on the performance of word transla-
tion. For this purpose, we trained word vectors on
the same Wikipedia data, using skipgram with and
without subword information. In Table 10, we re-
port the accuracy for different language pairs when
using these two sets of word vectors. Overall, we

Cross-lingual similarity. Finally, we evaluate
our aligned vectors on the task of cross-lingual
word similarity in Table 12. They obtain similar
results to vectors aligned with an orthogonal matrix.
These experiments concur with the previous obser-
vation that a linear non-orthogonal mapping does
not hurt the geometry of the word vector space.
