Abstract 

We describe the background for and building of IcePaHC, a one million word parsed historical corpus of Icelandic which has just been 
finished. This corpus which is completely free and open contains fragments of 60 texts ranging from the late 12th century to the present. 
We describe the text selection and text collecting process and discuss the quality of the texts and their conversion to modern Icelandic 
spelling. We explain why we choose to use a phrase structure Penn style annotation scheme and briefly describe the syntactic anno-
tation process. We also describe a spin-off project which is only in its beginning stages: a parsed historical corpus of Faroese. Finally, 
we advocate the importance of an open source policy as regards language resources.

1.  Introduction 
The parsed corpus, or treebank, reported on in this paper, 
Icelandic Parsed Historical Corpus or IcePaHC (Wallen-
berg et al., 2011) is the product of three different projects 
which  originally  had  different  aims.  The  earliest  and 
largest of these projects was a subpart of a large language 
technology project which had the aim of developing three 
different basic language resources for Icelandic. The aim 
of  this  subproject  was  to  build  a  treebank  of  Modern 
Icelandic for use in language technology and to develop 
efficient  parsing  methods  and  tools  for  less  resourced 
languages.  Since  some  of  the  participants  had  been  in-
volved  in  historical  syntax  research,  we  also  wanted  to 
include  a  few  texts  from  older  stages  of  the  language. 
However, the main emphasis was on language technology 
use  –  we  intended  to  use  the  texts  to  train  a  statistical 
parser for Modern Icelandic. 
At the same time, two other projects with the aim of de-
veloping  resources  for  studying  diachronic  Icelandic 
syntax  were  in  preparation.  After  some  discussion,  the 
participants in these three projects decided to join forces 
and make a combined effort to build a large parsed corpus 
covering the history of Icelandic syntax from the earliest 
sources up to the present. This corpus thus serves the dual 
purpose  of  being  one  of  the  cornerstones  of  Icelandic 
language technology and being an invaluable tool in Ice-
landic diachronic syntax research. 
The  corpus  is  now  finished  and  contains  one  million 
words. It has been made available through free download 
(http://linguist.is/icelandic_treebank/Download) – in fact, 
we  released  preliminary  versions  every  three  months 
through the whole project period. We believe the corpus is 
unusual in many ways. 
First, it is designed from the beginning to serve both as a 
language  technology  tool  and  a  syntactic  research  tool, 
and developed by people with research experience in both 
diachronic  syntax  and  computational  linguistics.  Most 
parsed  corpora  are  developed  either  for  language  tech-

nology  use  (such  as  the  Penn  Treebank,  http://www. 
cis.upenn.edu/~treebank/) or for syntactic research (such 
as the Penn Parsed Corpora of Historical English, PPCHE, 
http://www.ling.upenn.edu/hist-corpora/;  Kroch 
and 
Taylor, 2000; Kroch, Santorini and Delfs, 2004). 
Secondly,  the  corpus  spans  almost  ten  centuries  –  the 
oldest  texts  are  written  in  the  final  decades  of  the  12th 
century and the youngest are from the first decade of the 
21st  century.  As  far  as  we  know,  no  other  single  parsed 
corpus  comes  close  to  that.  Most  other  languages  have 
changed so much in the course of the last thousand years 
that it would be more challenging to apply the same an-
notation scheme for the whole period. 
Third, our corpus contains over one million words and is 
thus  among  the  largest  parsed  corpora  that  have  been 
published  for  any  language.  As  far  as  we  know,  only 
English and Czech have larger hand-checked treebanks. 
Fourth,  the  corpus  is  completely  free  and  open  without 
any registration or paperwork, and the same goes for all 
the software that has been used to build it and the software 
that was developed within the project. Both the software 
and  the  corpus  itself  are  distributed  under  the  LGPL  li-
cense. 

This paper describes the background of the treebank. In 
the next section, we explain how it is possible and why it 
is feasible to build a diachronic treebank spanning almost 
ten  centuries  in  the  history  of  Icelandic.  After  that,  we 
discuss several aspects of the  material in the  treebank – 
the selection of the texts, their quality, and their conver-
sion to modern Icelandic spelling. We then go on to ex-
plain  why  we  choose  to  build  a  Penn  style  treebank  in-
stead  of  a  dependency  treebank,  which  might  perhaps 
seem a more obvious choice. Following a short descrip-
tion  of  the  annotation  process,  we  briefly  describe  a 
spin-off  project:  a  parsed  historical  corpus  of  Faroese, 
FarPaHC, which is only in its beginning stages. Finally, 
we present our open source policy and set forth “10 basic 
types of user freedom” for language resources.

2.  The diachronic dimension 
Icelandic is a language with a rich literary heritage rang-
ing from the 12th century to the present. It is a commonly 
accepted  fact  that  Icelandic  morphosyntax  has  changed 
much less during the last thousand years than most other 
European languages. This has often been attributed to the 
strong  literary  tradition  and  the  isolation  of  the  country. 
However, it must be emphasized that some features of the 
language  have  in  fact  changed  considerably  since  Old 
Icelandic. Thus, the phonological system has undergone 
dramatic  changes,  especially  the  vowel  system.  The 
phonetic quality of many of the vowels has changed, and 
the quantity system has changed such that vowel length is 
now context-dependent instead of being fixed. 
On the other  hand, the  inflectional system and the  mor-
phology has in all relevant respects remained unchanged 
from the earliest texts up to the present, although a num-
ber of nouns have shifted inflectional class, a few strong 
verbs have become weak, one inflectional class of nouns 
has  been  lost,  and  the  dual  in  personal  and  possessive 
pronoun has disappeared. The syntax is also basically the 
same, although a number of changes have occurred. The 
changes mainly involve word order, especially within the 
verb  phrase,  and  the  development  of  new  modal  con-
structions (cf. for instance Rögnvaldsson and Helgadóttir, 
2011). 
Thus,  present-day  Icelanders  can  read  many  texts  from 
the  13th  century  without  special  training,  although  that 
doesn’t  necessarily  mean  that  they  can  read  the  texts 
directly  from  the  manuscripts.  There  was  no  accepted 
spelling  standard  until  the  20th  century,  and  the  same 
sounds, sound combinations and words can be written in 
many ways. However, since the morphology is the same, 
it  is  usually  relatively  straightforward  to  convert  older 
spelling to the modern standard and get legible text. 
These two features – the stability of the morphology and 
the changes in the syntax – are the reasons why it is both 
possible  and  feasible  to  build  one  treebank  with  texts 
spanning a period of ten centuries. If the  morphological 
system  had  changed  dramatically,  it  would  have  been 
difficult to apply the same annotation scheme to old and 
modern  texts.  On  the  other  hand,  the  known  syntactic 
changes  and  variation  do  not  greatly  complicate  the  an-
notation  scheme,  making  it  feasible  to  build  a  tool  that 
enables us to study these changes and variation in a sys-
tematic way. The parsed historical corpus is such a tool. 

3.  Texts 

3.1  Text selection 
Selecting texts to parse for the corpus was a challenging 
task. We wanted to have the corpus both representative of 
different text genres and comparable through the centuries. 
This  meant  that  we  excluded  some  genres  which  have 
emerged only recently, such as newspaper texts. We de-
cided  in  the  beginning  on  a  goal  of  parsing  one  million 
words  –  approximately  100,000  from  each  century  of 
Icelandic literary tradition. 
Our original plan was to have samples from five different 

genres of text for each century – preferably 20,000 words 
from each text. The genres we had in mind were narrative 
texts, religious texts, biographies, laws, and science. We 
knew  from the beginning that it would be impossible to 
reach this goal, simply because texts belonging to some of 
the genres do not exist from all 10 centuries. We started 
with  narrative texts and religious texts, since texts  from 
these two genres were easiest to get hold of. 
When  we  were  well  into  the  project,  we  decided  to 
abandon  the  original  plan  and  concentrate  on  these  two 
genres. Narrative texts are the overwhelming majority of 
preserved  medieval  texts,  and  those  which  have  been 
most  studied  and  are  easiest  to  get.  It  is  also  relatively 
easy  to  find  religious  texts  from  most  centuries,  but  bi-
ographies, laws, and scientific texts are much fewer and 
harder to find in edited editions. Thus, we decided to stick 
to the original plan of having around 100,000 words from 
each  century,  but  instead  of  dividing  this  evenly  among 
five genres, we aimed at having 80,000 words of narrative 
texts  and  20,000  words  of  religious  prose.  This  also  in-
creases the data set for the two genres, allowing for more 
reliable studies of style-shifting phenomena. 
By  and  large,  this  plan  could  be  upheld.  However,  we 
didn’t  manage  to  find  any  religious  text  that  could  be 
attributed to the 15th century, and it proved to be difficult 
to find enough narrative texts from the 16th through 18th 
centuries.  Instead,  we  included  more  of  religious  texts 
from the 16th century and some biographies from the 18th 
and  19th  centuries.  The  distribution  of  the  texts  across 
genres and centuries is shown in table 1.

Table 1: Text types 

 
The corpus contains (samples of) 60 different texts which 
came from various sources. Approximately 20 texts were 
taken from text repositories on the Internet, especially the 
Icelandic Netútgáfan (http://snerpa.is/net) but a few came 
from  the  Project  Gutenberg  website  (http://www.  guten-
berg.org), the Internet Archive (http://www.archive.org/) 
and  the  Medieval  Nordic  Text  Archive  (http://www. 
menota.org/).  Around  10  texts  came  from  the  Árni 
Magnússon  Institute  text  archive  (http://www.lexis.hi.is/ 
corpus/).  We  received  around  10  texts  directly  from 
scholars  who  have  been  editing  them  or  publishing 
companies that had published them. The remaining texts,

around 20, were keyed in for us by students working on 
the project. Four texts from the 20th and 21st centuries are 
still  under  copyright,  but  we  contacted  the  authors  who 
gave us permission to use them. 

3.2  Text quality 
The  quality  of  the  texts  varies  a  lot.  Very  few  Old  Ice-
landic texts are preserved in the original, and exact dating 
of the texts is often very difficult. Usually, the preserved 
manuscripts are assumed to be several decades and even 
centuries younger than the original text. We know that the 
scribes  did  not  copy  the  manuscripts  letter  for  letter  – 
often they just used their own spelling instead of retaining 
the spelling of the original. This makes it very difficult to 
use the text to study phonology and morphology (cf. for 
instance Bernharðsson, 1999). 
For those who use the text to study syntax and syntactic 
change, however, this is not a serious drawback, although 
in exceptional cases case distinctions in endings may be 
lost  due  to  phonological  changes  and/or  changes  in 
spelling.  On  the  other  hand,  it  is  usually  assumed  that 
scribes  more  or  less  retained  the  word  order  and  other 
syntactic  features  of  the  manuscript  they  were  copying, 
although there are a number of known exceptions to this. 
The  treebank  is  accompanied  by  detailed  “info”  files 
which users can consult and make their own decisions on 
using or disregarding data from certain texts.  

3.3 Text conversion 
We decided to convert all our texts to  modern Icelandic 
spelling.  There  were  two  reasons  for  this.  One  was  that 
this  makes  it  possible  to  search  for  individual  words 
without  having  to  capture  all  possible  spelling  variants 
using fuzzy search, regular expressions and the like. The 
main  reason  was,  however,  that  we  wanted  to  use  the 
open-source  IceNLP  package  for  preprocessing.  This 
package  (available  at  http://icenlp.sourceforge.net)  con-
tains a tokenizer, a PoS tagger, a lemmatizer, and a shal-
low parser (Loftsson, 2008; Loftsson and Rögnvaldsson, 
2007;  Ingason  et  al.,  2008).  It  was  written  for  Modern 
Icelandic texts and its dictionary assumes that words have 
Modern Icelandic spelling. If  we had given the package 
input in the original spelling of each text, the result of the 
preprocessing would have been much poorer. 
All major texts from the medieval period have been pub-
lished, although the editions are not always as good as one 
would wish. Many texts from the 16th up to the 19th cen-
tury, however, have never been published. We decided in 
the beginning that we would only use texts from printed 
sources  –  it  would  have  been  prohibitively  time-  con-
suming and expensive to digitize texts from manuscripts. 
Editions  of  medieval  Icelandic  texts  have  one  of  three 
formats: 1) Diplomatic editions, where the text is printed 
exactly as in the manuscripts. 2) Standardized Old Norse 
spelling, which is a standard developed in the 19th century 
and is meant to mirror the sound system of 13th century 
Icelandic. 3) Modern Icelandic spelling. For most of the 
20th  century,  editions  of  medieval  texts  intended  for  the 
public were usually in the standardized Old Norse spell-

ing. Since the 1970s, however, it has become customary 
to use modern Icelandic spelling in new editions of me-
dieval  texts,  even  though  editions  mainly  aimed  at 
scholars  usually  try  to  mirror  the  spelling  of  the  manu-
script as closely as possible. Texts from the 19th century 
onwards  usually  only  have  minor  deviations  from  the 
modern spelling.  
A number of texts were in modern Icelandic spelling and 
could  be  used  as  they  were.  However,  the  majority  of 
them  were  either  in  standardized  Old  Norse  spelling  or 
diplomatic, and thus had to be changed. For the texts in 
the standardized Old Norse spelling, the task was rather 
easy, and a few simple scripts could be used to make most 
of the changes. The diplomatic editions were much harder. 
Some  scripts  and  simple  search-and-replace  could  help, 
but  since  the  spelling  in  these  texts  is  often  highly  ir-
regular, we had to go over them word by word and correct 
them, which was rather tedious and time-consuming.  

4.  Annotation 

4.1  Annotation scheme 
One  of  the  main  questions  which  had  to  be  answered 
before  the  annotation  started  was  which  annotation 
scheme to use. Most of the treebanks that have been built 
for the Scandinavian languages use some  version of de-
pendency parsing (e.g. Kromann, 2003; Bick, 2003; Nivre, 
Nilsson and Hall, 2006), so in some sense it would have 
been most natural for us to follow them. However, we had 
close contacts with the treebank team at the University of 
Pennsylvania  from  the  early  stages  of  the  project,  so  it 
was  a  natural  choice  for  us  to  use  the  phrase  structure 
annotation  scheme  that  they  have  developed  for  their 
parsed  historical  corpora  (Kroch,  Santorini  and  Delfs, 
2004;  Kroch  and  Taylor,  2000;  Santorini,  2010).  Thus, 
IcePaHC uses the same general type of labeled bracketing 
as  the  Penn  Treebank  (with  dash-separated  lemmata 
added) as shown below: 
 

( (IP-MAT (NP-SBJ (PRO-N Hann-hann)) 
        (VBDI spurði-spyrja) 
        (CP-QUE (WADVP-1 (WADV hvernig-hvernig)) 
              (C 0) 
              (IP-SUB (ADVP *T*-1) 
                    (NP-SBJ(NPR-D Grími-grímur)) 
                    (VBDS liði-líða)))) 
(ID 1888.GRIMUR.NAR-FIC,.301)) 
 
This  proved  to  be  a  very  fortunate  decision.  The  Penn 
annotation  scheme  has  already  been  adapted  for  Old 
English  (Taylor  et  al,.  2003),  which  is  rather  similar  to 
Icelandic in many respects, both as regards the syntax and 
the  morphological  system.  Thus,  the  scheme  could  be 
applied to Icelandic with only slight modifications. Fur-
thermore, the Penn team has written extensive annotation 
guidelines  which  were  of  tremendous  help  in  our  work 
(Santorini,  2010).  We  were  careful  to  write  our  own 
guidelines  and  document  all  deviations  from  and  addi-
tions to the Penn guidelines. 

1979

The decision to model our annotation on the Penn anno-
tation system also meant that we could use the software 
that has been written especially to facilitate the annotation 
(CorpusDraw)  and  to  search  the  corpus  (CorpusSearch; 
Randall, 2005). An extra bonus is that it is now very easy 
to compare Icelandic and older stages of English. We can 
write search queries for English in CorpusSearch and by 
and  large  use  the  same  queries  for  Icelandic,  although 
minor  modifications  are  sometimes  necessary.  Further-
more,  Penn-style  treebanks  have  been  built  or  are  cur-
rently being built for a number of other languages, such as 
French  (Martineu  et  al.,  2010),  Portuguese  (Galves  and 
Britto, 2002), Early High German (Light, 2010), Classical 
Greek (Beck, 2011), Yiddish (Santorini, 1997/2008), and 
more.  This  development  means  that  cross-linguistic, 
comparative  diachronic  studies  can  be  carried  out  in  a 
controlled  and  reproducible  way  with  the  same  search 
queries across these datasets. 
Yet  another  reason  for  choosing  the  Penn  annotation 
system  was  that  it  is  relatively  rich,  compared  to  most 
dependency-based schemes. Thus, it should – in principle, 
at  least  –  be  possible  to  convert  our  treebank  to  a  de-
pendency  treebank,  although  some  information  will  be 
lost in the conversion. Going the other way, that is, con-
verting  a  dependency-based  treebank  to  a  Penn-style 
phrase  structure  treebank,  would,  on  the  other  hand,  be 
impossible without adding information. 
Even though we followed the Penn scheme in most cases, 
we found it necessary to make some slight modifications, 
as mentioned above. The most important of these are that 
we annotate the words for lemma and nominals also for 
case,  neither  of  which  is  done  in  the  English  historical 
corpora (excepting case in Old English). 

4.2  The annotation process 
After  the  texts  had  been  converted  to  modern  Icelandic 
spelling, they were handed over to student assistants who 
had the task of dividing them into clauses. Some periods 
do  not  signal  the  end  of  a  tree  and  not  all  trees  end  in 
periods.  Sentence  boundary  detection  for  English  has 
been  shown  to  classify  periods  such  that  98.5%  of  sen-
tences boundaries are correctly identified, a considerable 
improvement over the 90% precision of a baseline clas-
sifier  which  assumes  every  period  to  be  a  boundary 
(Palmer  and  Hearst,  1994).  While  this  may  seem  en-
couraging  we  have  two  good  reasons  for  preferring  a 
manual approach to clause boundary detection. 
First,  while  rules  for  classifying  periods  as  boundary 
marking  or  not  are  fairly  simple,  the  rules  for  inserting 
clause  boundaries  (usually  between  well-formed  matrix 
clauses  but  sometimes  sentence  fragments  without 
enough  material  to  reconstruct  clausal  structure  reliably 
and  consistently)  are  more  complicated  and  require  in-
terpretation  of  gapping  structures  where  the  nature  and 
amount of omitted material affects the boundary status of 
conjunctive elements. Such problems can in principle be 
addressed using computational methods but the required 
tools  are  not  currently  available  for  Icelandic  and  their 
development was beyond the scope of our project. 

Second,  while  clause  boundary  detection  is  not  a  trivial 
computational task it is fairly simple for a human and this 
part of the annotation could be carried out fast and reliably 
by research assistants which did not have to be trained in 
the complexities of full phrase structure annotation. 
After running IceNLP we ran a few programs developed 
within the project to prepare the text for manual annota-
tion.  The  PoS  tagset  was  converted  to  a  format  nearly 
identical to the Penn Parsed Corpora of Historical English, 
the format of the labeled bracketing was converted to the 
Penn  treebank  format  for  compatibility  with  existing 
software  and  various  structures  were  partially  annotated 
using  CorpusSearch  revision  queries  (Randall,  2005). 
Such partial annotation includes building the left edge of 
subordinate  clauses  whose  right  edge  is  subsequently 
determined by a human annotator.  
The manual annotation phase comprised the bulk of the 
work. In the beginning, we used the CorpusDraw software 
to correct the parse, but we soon realized that it would be 
possible to speed up the annotation if we had software that 
was  better  suited  for  the  task.  Therefore,  we  wrote  the 
annotation tool Annotald which made it possible to speed 
up  the  annotation  considerably.  Annotald  is  a  browser 
based  cross-platform  visual  tree  editor  which  combines 
keyboard and mouse shortcuts such that the annotator can 
always keep the left hand on the keyboard and the right 
hand  on  the  mouse.  This  avoids  moving  the  right  hand 
back and forth between mouse and keyboard which leads 
to  improved  speed  and  accuracy  over  CorpusDraw  (see 
Figure 1 for the overall impact of improved methods and 
training  on  tree  production).  Annotald  is  released  under 
the  GPL  license  and  continues  to  be  developed  by  a 
growing  team  of  programmers  at  the  University  of 
Pennsylvania (Beck, Ecay and Ingason, 2011). 
 

 

Figure 1: The annotation process 

 
Three annotators worked on the project. In the beginning, 
they reviewed each other’s work and spent a lot of time 
consulting the annotation manual for the Penn Historical 
Corpora (Santorini, 2010), which we succeeded in adapt-
ing  to  Icelandic.  When  the  annotators  had  become  well 
acquainted  with  the  annotation  scheme  and  developed 
special  annotation  rules  for  most  of  the  cases  where 
Icelandic  deviates  from  Old(er)  English,  they  stopped 
reviewing  each  other’s  annotations  and  placed  the  em-

1980

phasis on speeding up the annotation as much as possible. 
Figure  1  shows  the  annotation  progress  for  the  whole 
project period. 
We are in no doubt that the speed of the annotation proc-
ess, and the fact that a large part of the annotation has not 
been reviewed, has resulted in a considerable number of 
annotation  errors  and  discrepancies.  The  errors  are  nev-
ertheless a small minority of potential errors. Our current 
approach to correction is to systematically enforce more 
constraints  on  well-formed  structures.  For  example,  the 
latest  release  of  the  corpus  (Wallenberg  et  al.  2011)  in-
correctly contains 51 clauses with two phrases labeled as 
direct  objects  (NP-OB1).  This  is  about  1%  of  the  4727 
double  object  clauses  in  the  corpus  and  in  most  of  the 
cases one of the two objects should be labeled as an in-
direct object (NP-OB2). 
These errors and many more have been corrected for the 
next release of the corpus. However, we want to empha-
size that the corpus is  meant  to be used  for quantitative 
research,  not  qualitative.  It  is  not  possible  to  take  the 
parsing of any single sentence from the corpus and rely on 
it  without  reflection.  The  reasons  are  both  that  the  text 
may  be  of  disputable  age  and  the  parse  may  contain  an 
error.  However,  we  believe  that  the  quantity  of  the  text 
and  its  overall  quality  make  the  corpus  safe  to  use  in 
quantitative studies and the quality will only improve as 
future users notify us of errors they catch in their work. 

5.  A Spin-off: FarPaHC 

5.1  Background 
Since  we  believe  the  model  we  used  in  the  building  of 
IcePaHC was highly successful, we wanted to extend this 
model  to  a  related  less-resourced  language  and  build  a 
Faroese  Parsed  Historical  Corpus,  FarPaHC.  Faroese  is 
spoken by 48,000 people in the Faroe Islands, 25,000 in 
Denmark and 5,000 people in Iceland (http://fo.wikipedia. 
org/wiki/Føroyskt_mál). The closest relative of Faroese is 
Icelandic and the two languages share a number of prop-
erties.  Both  languages  have  rich  case  morphology  (four 
cases) and nominals and adjectives also inflect for number 
and gender. A native speaker of Icelandic can read written 
Faroese (and vice versa), though the spoken languages are 
just  different  enough  to  not  be  mutually  intelligible 
without considerable effort. 
Our  goal  is  to  build  a  250,000  word  fully  parsed,  PoS 
tagged  and  lemmatized  corpus  of  19th-21st  century 
Faroese. The reason why we do not have older texts is that 
Faroese literary tradition is so short. Since IcePaHC con-
sists mostly of religious texts and narratives, we focus on 
balancing FarPaHC for the same genres, which will help 
to  control  for  social  and  stylistic  factors  when  syntactic 
change  and  stability  in  Icelandic  and  Faroese  are  com-
pared.  This  means  that  most  texts  in  the  treebank  date 
from the 19th century to the present. In IcePaHC, around 
100,000  words  were  parsed  for  each  century  with  the 
exception  that  there  is  only  a  little  more  than  40,000 
words from the 12th and the 21st century each. In light of 
this,  our  aim  for  FarPaHC  is  to  parse  200,000  words  in 

total from texts dating from the 19th and 20th century and 
50,000 words from the 21st century. The main reason for 
our modest goal of 250,000 words is that there is only one 
annotator working on the project. 
Our  method  of  text  selection  within  these  genres  is  pri-
marily  in  order  to  facilitate  cross-linguistic  comparison, 
especially  with  Icelandic,  English,  and  other  Germanic 
languages,  but  it  is  also  partly  opportunistic.  We  try  to 
find texts that are already digitized because it costs money 
and  time  to  key  them  in  (and  even  more  to  transcribe 
manuscripts).  We  also  focus  on  parsing  texts  that  are 
parallel  translations  of  texts  found  in  IcePaHC  and 
PPCHE,  such  as  the  Gospel  of  John  and  Acts  of  the 
Apostles from the New Testament. We are also going to 
parse at least one Faroese version of a narrative found in 
IcePaHC. Such a text could be one of the Icelandic family 
sagas, for instance The Saga of Grettir the Strong (Grettis 
saga). The size of the samples from each text is intended 
to  be  similar  to  those  in  PPCHE  and  IcePaHC,  roughly 
20,000 words (when possible). 

for 

the 

5.2  Annotation 
When we started building FarPaHC we used the modified 
PPCHE scheme from IcePaHC. As pointed out above, this 
allows for easy crosslinguistic comparison, as well as for 
experimentation  in  developing  multilingual  taggers  and 
parsers. For more consistent parse we document our de-
cisions (http://linguist.is/farpahc/) and where possible, we 
follow 
PPCHE 
guidelines  written 
(http://www.ling.upenn.edu/hist-corpora/)  and  the  Ice-
PaHC  documentation  (http://linguist.is/icelandic_tree- 
bank/).  This  is  also  helpful  for  users  of  the  treebank. 
Morphologically  and  syntactically,  Faroese  resembles 
Icelandic in many ways. This makes it more important to 
follow the guidelines for IcePaHC and saves a lot of time 
because this decreases the number of decisions that need 
to be taken in the annotation process. 
Since the annotator in the FarPaHC project has experience 
from IcePaHC we do not have to spend time and money 
on training. If one can read Icelandic it is  fairly easy to 
read Faroese as well so the language does not either slow 
us down. However, for semi-automatic parsing we are not 
able  to  use  parsers,  morphological  taggers  and  lemma-
tizers  written  for  Faroese  –  we  must  rely  on  programs 
written  for  Icelandic,  especially  the  IceNLP  package 
which  was  used  in  the  IcePaHC  annotation.  This  de-
creases the parsing speed in the beginning of the project. 
Nevertheless,  we  use IceNLP in our annotation process, 
even though the tagger and lemmatizer produce a number 
of errors that they would not on Icelandic data. To correct 
this effect as efficiently as possible, we specify a number 
of  handwritten  rules  as  we  go  along  which  slows  the 
process down at  first.  We focus on  writing rules  for the 
most common words, e.g., pronouns, quantifiers, auxilia-
ries (HAVE and BE), modal verbs and function words, such 
as complementizers and prepositions. 
When we have run IceNLP on the raw data, we take the 
output and manually parse it with Annotald (Beck, Ecay 
and  Ingason,  2011;  cf.  above).  The  following  is  a  fully 

1981

parsed  (and  handcorrected)  token  in  FarPaHC  (the  sen-
tence  is  from  the  Gospel  of  John).  For  convenience  we 
leave out the glosses.

Since  FarPaHC  is  compatible  with,  e.g.,  IcePaHC  and 
PPCHE the same, or very similar, queries can be used. To 
demonstrate  this  we  show  the  same  sentence  from  the 
Gospel of John as above in IcePaHC and the Penn Parsed 
Corpus  of  Early  Modern  English  (Kroch,  Santorini  and 
Delfs, 2004), respectively.

We plan to publish the first version, 0.1, on June 1st. Every 
four months after that we plan to release a new version, 
with  more  words,  until  we  achieve  our  goal  of  250,000 
words. Even though the first release of the corpus will be 
rather  small,  probably  around  50,000  words,  it  can  be 
useful to have this resource in comparative syntactic re-
search,  especially  since  the  first  texts  that  we  parse,  the 
Gospel of John and the Acts of the Apostles, are found in 
other Penn style treebanks, such as IcePaHC and PPCHE. 
People who prefer dependency treebanks should be able 
to use it by converting our parse to a dependency parse. 
The first release will  nevertheless probably be too small 
for computational linguists to train data-driven tools. 

6.  Maximizing distribution 
and user freedom 
We believe strongly in the sharing of resources. True to 
that spirit, we decided at the beginning of the project that 
we wanted to make our work as open and widely distrib-
uted  as  possible.  To  emphasize  that,  we  defined  the 
following “10 basic types of user freedom”: 
 
1.  Raw data available can be downloaded for local use 

(corpus not hidden behind a search interface) 

2.  Comprehensive  documentation 

freely  available 

online 

3.  Available  without  registration,  user  identification  of 

some sort, or signing of contracts 

4.  Development  process  of  corpus  relies  only  on 
free/open source software tools (for transparent rep-
lication of annotation process) 

5.  Open  development  (annotation  is  carried  out  in  an 
open  online  version  control  repository  for  transpar-
ency  regarding  the  actual  steps  taken  in  the  devel-
opment and immediate access to work-in-progress) 
6.  Regular  scheduled  releases  of  numbered  versions 
during  development  as  well  as  for  more  permanent 
milestone  versions  so  that  researchers  can  always 
produce replicable results on a recent version of the 
corpus 

7.  Users  can  improve  the  corpus  and  release  modified 

versions without special permission 

8.  Free of cost to academia 
9.  Free of cost to commercial users 
10. Corpus released under a standard free license of some 
sort for straightforward compatibility with other pro-
jects (GPL, LGPL, CC, etc.) 

 
We decided not to wait until the treebank was finished to 
release it. Instead, we released a new version every three 
months, in the hope of incrementally building up a user 
base and getting feedback from users which we could use 
to  improve  the  treebank.  This  worked  very  well  –  for 
instance,  Version  0.4,  released  in  April  2011  and  con-
taining  around  440,000  words,  was  downloaded  (in  dif-
ferent  formats)  more  than  450  times  from  the  project 
website  (http://linguist.is/icelandic_treebank/Download). 
Furthermore,  the  treebank  had  already  been  used  in  a 
number of studies before the current version was released 
in August 2011 (e.g. Sapp, 2011; Ingason, Sigurðsson and 
Wallenberg, 2011; Light and Wallenberg, 2011). 
As  pointed  out  by  Muhonen  and  Purtonen  (2011),  it  is 
more difficult to gather information about the number of 
users of free treebanks than treebanks which require user 
registration, but we believe the benefits of user freedom 
outweigh such minor problems and in the course of time 
the impact of the treebank will be measured by its usage in 
published works rather than by raw download counts. 
We  follow  the  principles  listed  above  strictly  in  the  on-
going FarPaHC project. That involves regular scheduled 
releases before we reach our goal of 250,000 words. Re-
garding the  fifth pointer above (open development), our 
open online version control repository is found on github. 
The URL is https://github.com/antonkarl/icecorpus. 
Even though IcePaHC is practically finished, the current 
version is numbered 0.9 because some minor corrections 
remain to be made. The treebank is released in three ver-
sions;  a  zip-file  containing  the  raw  data  of  the  of  the 
corpus in labeled bracketing format; an easy-to-use setup 
executable  for  Windows  that  installs  the  corpus  and  a 
graphical  user  interface;  and  a  zip-file  containing  the 
corpus and a platform independent user interface in Java. 
The  treebank  has  also  been  uploaded  to  the  INESS  re-
pository at the University of Bergen (http://iness.uib.no) 
where it may be viewed and searched.

language resources under an open source license. This is 
especially  important  when  working  on  less-resourced 
languages  where  duplication  of  work  must  be  avoided. 
We  hope  that  other  researchers  will  follow  in  our  steps 
and make their resources and tools publicly available for 
the benefit of all.

7.  Conclusion 
In  this  paper,  we  have  described  the  parsed  historical 
corpus  of  Icelandic,  IcePaHC,  and  its  motivations.  As 
pointed  out  in  the  introduction,  the  corpus  was  built  in 
order to serve two purposes: first, to be used within lan-
guage technology to train parsers etc., and secondly, to be 
used as a tool for diachronic syntactic research.  
Its  usefulness  for  the  latter  purpose  has  already  been 
demonstrated.  For  instance,  four  papers  that  were  pre-
sented at the 13th Diachronic Generative Syntax Confer-
ence  (DiGS)  in  June  2011  made  use  of  the  corpus  (see 
http://www.ling.upenn.edu/Events/DIGS13/).  As  for  the 
first purpose, the corpus has not yet been put to use but 
there is no reason to doubt that it can serve that purpose 
too. The corpus contains around 300,000 words which can 
safely  be  considered  Modern  Icelandic  –  texts  from  the 
19th,  20th  and  21st  centuries.  That  is  more  than  enough 
material to train a statistical parser. The project has also 
created a spin-off in the Faroese parsed historical corpus, 
FarPaHC. 
As mentioned above, we believe that IcePaHC is unusual 
for a number of reasons. The most important one is that 
we  have  brought  together  a  group  of  researchers  who 
come from different fields and have different motives, but 
saw  the  benefits  of  joining  their  forces  in  building  an 
important language resource which serves a dual purpose. 
The interdisciplinarity of the team should ensure that both 
humanist  researchers  and  language  technologists  feel  at 
ease in using the corpus in their work. 
Finally,  we  emphasize  the  importance  of  distributing

Abstract 

We describe the background for and building of IcePaHC, a one million word parsed historical corpus of Icelandic which has just been 
finished. This corpus which is completely free and open contains fragments of 60 texts ranging from the late 12th century to the present. 
We describe the text selection and text collecting process and discuss the quality of the texts and their conversion to modern Icelandic 
spelling. We explain why we choose to use a phrase structure Penn style annotation scheme and briefly describe the syntactic anno-
tation process. We also describe a spin-off project which is only in its beginning stages: a parsed historical corpus of Faroese. Finally, 
we advocate the importance of an open source policy as regards language resources.

1.  Introduction 
The parsed corpus, or treebank, reported on in this paper, 
Icelandic Parsed Historical Corpus or IcePaHC (Wallen-
berg et al., 2011) is the product of three different projects 
which  originally  had  different  aims.  The  earliest  and 
largest of these projects was a subpart of a large language 
technology project which had the aim of developing three 
different basic language resources for Icelandic. The aim 
of  this  subproject  was  to  build  a  treebank  of  Modern 
Icelandic for use in language technology and to develop 
efficient  parsing  methods  and  tools  for  less  resourced 
languages.  Since  some  of  the  participants  had  been  in-
volved  in  historical  syntax  research,  we  also  wanted  to 
include  a  few  texts  from  older  stages  of  the  language. 
However, the main emphasis was on language technology 
use  –  we  intended  to  use  the  texts  to  train  a  statistical 
parser for Modern Icelandic. 
At the same time, two other projects with the aim of de-
veloping  resources  for  studying  diachronic  Icelandic 
syntax  were  in  preparation.  After  some  discussion,  the 
participants in these three projects decided to join forces 
and make a combined effort to build a large parsed corpus 
covering the history of Icelandic syntax from the earliest 
sources up to the present. This corpus thus serves the dual 
purpose  of  being  one  of  the  cornerstones  of  Icelandic 
language technology and being an invaluable tool in Ice-
landic diachronic syntax research. 
The  corpus  is  now  finished  and  contains  one  million 
words. It has been made available through free download 
(http://linguist.is/icelandic_treebank/Download) – in fact, 
we  released  preliminary  versions  every  three  months 
through the whole project period. We believe the corpus is 
unusual in many ways. 
First, it is designed from the beginning to serve both as a 
language  technology  tool  and  a  syntactic  research  tool, 
and developed by people with research experience in both 
diachronic  syntax  and  computational  linguistics.  Most 
parsed  corpora  are  developed  either  for  language  tech-

nology  use  (such  as  the  Penn  Treebank,  http://www. 
cis.upenn.edu/~treebank/) or for syntactic research (such 
as the Penn Parsed Corpora of Historical English, PPCHE, 
http://www.ling.upenn.edu/hist-corpora/;  Kroch 
and 
Taylor, 2000; Kroch, Santorini and Delfs, 2004). 
Secondly,  the  corpus  spans  almost  ten  centuries  –  the 
oldest  texts  are  written  in  the  final  decades  of  the  12th 
century and the youngest are from the first decade of the 
21st  century.  As  far  as  we  know,  no  other  single  parsed 
corpus  comes  close  to  that.  Most  other  languages  have 
changed so much in the course of the last thousand years 
that it would be more challenging to apply the same an-
notation scheme for the whole period. 
Third, our corpus contains over one million words and is 
thus  among  the  largest  parsed  corpora  that  have  been 
published  for  any  language.  As  far  as  we  know,  only 
English and Czech have larger hand-checked treebanks. 
Fourth,  the  corpus  is  completely  free  and  open  without 
any registration or paperwork, and the same goes for all 
the software that has been used to build it and the software 
that was developed within the project. Both the software 
and  the  corpus  itself  are  distributed  under  the  LGPL  li-
cense. 

This paper describes the background of the treebank. In 
the next section, we explain how it is possible and why it 
is feasible to build a diachronic treebank spanning almost 
ten  centuries  in  the  history  of  Icelandic.  After  that,  we 
discuss several aspects of the  material in the  treebank – 
the selection of the texts, their quality, and their conver-
sion to modern Icelandic spelling. We then go on to ex-
plain  why  we  choose  to  build  a  Penn  style  treebank  in-
stead  of  a  dependency  treebank,  which  might  perhaps 
seem a more obvious choice. Following a short descrip-
tion  of  the  annotation  process,  we  briefly  describe  a 
spin-off  project:  a  parsed  historical  corpus  of  Faroese, 
FarPaHC, which is only in its beginning stages. Finally, 
we present our open source policy and set forth “10 basic 
types of user freedom” for language resources.

2.  The diachronic dimension 
Icelandic is a language with a rich literary heritage rang-
ing from the 12th century to the present. It is a commonly 
accepted  fact  that  Icelandic  morphosyntax  has  changed 
much less during the last thousand years than most other 
European languages. This has often been attributed to the 
strong  literary  tradition  and  the  isolation  of  the  country. 
However, it must be emphasized that some features of the 
language  have  in  fact  changed  considerably  since  Old 
Icelandic. Thus, the phonological system has undergone 
dramatic  changes,  especially  the  vowel  system.  The 
phonetic quality of many of the vowels has changed, and 
the quantity system has changed such that vowel length is 
now context-dependent instead of being fixed. 
On the other  hand, the  inflectional system and the  mor-
phology has in all relevant respects remained unchanged 
from the earliest texts up to the present, although a num-
ber of nouns have shifted inflectional class, a few strong 
verbs have become weak, one inflectional class of nouns 
has  been  lost,  and  the  dual  in  personal  and  possessive 
pronoun has disappeared. The syntax is also basically the 
same, although a number of changes have occurred. The 
changes mainly involve word order, especially within the 
verb  phrase,  and  the  development  of  new  modal  con-
structions (cf. for instance Rögnvaldsson and Helgadóttir, 
2011). 
Thus,  present-day  Icelanders  can  read  many  texts  from 
the  13th  century  without  special  training,  although  that 
doesn’t  necessarily  mean  that  they  can  read  the  texts 
directly  from  the  manuscripts.  There  was  no  accepted 
spelling  standard  until  the  20th  century,  and  the  same 
sounds, sound combinations and words can be written in 
many ways. However, since the morphology is the same, 
it  is  usually  relatively  straightforward  to  convert  older 
spelling to the modern standard and get legible text. 
These two features – the stability of the morphology and 
the changes in the syntax – are the reasons why it is both 
possible  and  feasible  to  build  one  treebank  with  texts 
spanning a period of ten centuries. If the  morphological 
system  had  changed  dramatically,  it  would  have  been 
difficult to apply the same annotation scheme to old and 
modern  texts.  On  the  other  hand,  the  known  syntactic 
changes  and  variation  do  not  greatly  complicate  the  an-
notation  scheme,  making  it  feasible  to  build  a  tool  that 
enables us to study these changes and variation in a sys-
tematic way. The parsed historical corpus is such a tool. 

3.  Texts 

3.1  Text selection 
Selecting texts to parse for the corpus was a challenging 
task. We wanted to have the corpus both representative of 
different text genres and comparable through the centuries. 
This  meant  that  we  excluded  some  genres  which  have 
emerged only recently, such as newspaper texts. We de-
cided  in  the  beginning  on  a  goal  of  parsing  one  million 
words  –  approximately  100,000  from  each  century  of 
Icelandic literary tradition. 
Our original plan was to have samples from five different 

genres of text for each century – preferably 20,000 words 
from each text. The genres we had in mind were narrative 
texts, religious texts, biographies, laws, and science. We 
knew  from the beginning that it would be impossible to 
reach this goal, simply because texts belonging to some of 
the genres do not exist from all 10 centuries. We started 
with  narrative texts and religious texts, since texts  from 
these two genres were easiest to get hold of. 
When  we  were  well  into  the  project,  we  decided  to 
abandon  the  original  plan  and  concentrate  on  these  two 
genres. Narrative texts are the overwhelming majority of 
preserved  medieval  texts,  and  those  which  have  been 
most  studied  and  are  easiest  to  get.  It  is  also  relatively 
easy  to  find  religious  texts  from  most  centuries,  but  bi-
ographies, laws, and scientific texts are much fewer and 
harder to find in edited editions. Thus, we decided to stick 
to the original plan of having around 100,000 words from 
each  century,  but  instead  of  dividing  this  evenly  among 
five genres, we aimed at having 80,000 words of narrative 
texts  and  20,000  words  of  religious  prose.  This  also  in-
creases the data set for the two genres, allowing for more 
reliable studies of style-shifting phenomena. 
By  and  large,  this  plan  could  be  upheld.  However,  we 
didn’t  manage  to  find  any  religious  text  that  could  be 
attributed to the 15th century, and it proved to be difficult 
to find enough narrative texts from the 16th through 18th 
centuries.  Instead,  we  included  more  of  religious  texts 
from the 16th century and some biographies from the 18th 
and  19th  centuries.  The  distribution  of  the  texts  across 
genres and centuries is shown in table 1.

Table 1: Text types 

 
The corpus contains (samples of) 60 different texts which 
came from various sources. Approximately 20 texts were 
taken from text repositories on the Internet, especially the 
Icelandic Netútgáfan (http://snerpa.is/net) but a few came 
from  the  Project  Gutenberg  website  (http://www.  guten-
berg.org), the Internet Archive (http://www.archive.org/) 
and  the  Medieval  Nordic  Text  Archive  (http://www. 
menota.org/).  Around  10  texts  came  from  the  Árni 
Magnússon  Institute  text  archive  (http://www.lexis.hi.is/ 
corpus/).  We  received  around  10  texts  directly  from 
scholars  who  have  been  editing  them  or  publishing 
companies that had published them. The remaining texts,

around 20, were keyed in for us by students working on 
the project. Four texts from the 20th and 21st centuries are 
still  under  copyright,  but  we  contacted  the  authors  who 
gave us permission to use them. 

3.2  Text quality 
The  quality  of  the  texts  varies  a  lot.  Very  few  Old  Ice-
landic texts are preserved in the original, and exact dating 
of the texts is often very difficult. Usually, the preserved 
manuscripts are assumed to be several decades and even 
centuries younger than the original text. We know that the 
scribes  did  not  copy  the  manuscripts  letter  for  letter  – 
often they just used their own spelling instead of retaining 
the spelling of the original. This makes it very difficult to 
use the text to study phonology and morphology (cf. for 
instance Bernharðsson, 1999). 
For those who use the text to study syntax and syntactic 
change, however, this is not a serious drawback, although 
in exceptional cases case distinctions in endings may be 
lost  due  to  phonological  changes  and/or  changes  in 
spelling.  On  the  other  hand,  it  is  usually  assumed  that 
scribes  more  or  less  retained  the  word  order  and  other 
syntactic  features  of  the  manuscript  they  were  copying, 
although there are a number of known exceptions to this. 
The  treebank  is  accompanied  by  detailed  “info”  files 
which users can consult and make their own decisions on 
using or disregarding data from certain texts.  

3.3 Text conversion 
We decided to convert all our texts to  modern Icelandic 
spelling.  There  were  two  reasons  for  this.  One  was  that 
this  makes  it  possible  to  search  for  individual  words 
without  having  to  capture  all  possible  spelling  variants 
using fuzzy search, regular expressions and the like. The 
main  reason  was,  however,  that  we  wanted  to  use  the 
open-source  IceNLP  package  for  preprocessing.  This 
package  (available  at  http://icenlp.sourceforge.net)  con-
tains a tokenizer, a PoS tagger, a lemmatizer, and a shal-
low parser (Loftsson, 2008; Loftsson and Rögnvaldsson, 
2007;  Ingason  et  al.,  2008).  It  was  written  for  Modern 
Icelandic texts and its dictionary assumes that words have 
Modern Icelandic spelling. If  we had given the package 
input in the original spelling of each text, the result of the 
preprocessing would have been much poorer. 
All major texts from the medieval period have been pub-
lished, although the editions are not always as good as one 
would wish. Many texts from the 16th up to the 19th cen-
tury, however, have never been published. We decided in 
the beginning that we would only use texts from printed 
sources  –  it  would  have  been  prohibitively  time-  con-
suming and expensive to digitize texts from manuscripts. 
Editions  of  medieval  Icelandic  texts  have  one  of  three 
formats: 1) Diplomatic editions, where the text is printed 
exactly as in the manuscripts. 2) Standardized Old Norse 
spelling, which is a standard developed in the 19th century 
and is meant to mirror the sound system of 13th century 
Icelandic. 3) Modern Icelandic spelling. For most of the 
20th  century,  editions  of  medieval  texts  intended  for  the 
public were usually in the standardized Old Norse spell-

ing. Since the 1970s, however, it has become customary 
to use modern Icelandic spelling in new editions of me-
dieval  texts,  even  though  editions  mainly  aimed  at 
scholars  usually  try  to  mirror  the  spelling  of  the  manu-
script as closely as possible. Texts from the 19th century 
onwards  usually  only  have  minor  deviations  from  the 
modern spelling.  
A number of texts were in modern Icelandic spelling and 
could  be  used  as  they  were.  However,  the  majority  of 
them  were  either  in  standardized  Old  Norse  spelling  or 
diplomatic, and thus had to be changed. For the texts in 
the standardized Old Norse spelling, the task was rather 
easy, and a few simple scripts could be used to make most 
of the changes. The diplomatic editions were much harder. 
Some  scripts  and  simple  search-and-replace  could  help, 
but  since  the  spelling  in  these  texts  is  often  highly  ir-
regular, we had to go over them word by word and correct 
them, which was rather tedious and time-consuming.  

4.  Annotation 

4.1  Annotation scheme 
One  of  the  main  questions  which  had  to  be  answered 
before  the  annotation  started  was  which  annotation 
scheme to use. Most of the treebanks that have been built 
for the Scandinavian languages use some  version of de-
pendency parsing (e.g. Kromann, 2003; Bick, 2003; Nivre, 
Nilsson and Hall, 2006), so in some sense it would have 
been most natural for us to follow them. However, we had 
close contacts with the treebank team at the University of 
Pennsylvania  from  the  early  stages  of  the  project,  so  it 
was  a  natural  choice  for  us  to  use  the  phrase  structure 
annotation  scheme  that  they  have  developed  for  their 
parsed  historical  corpora  (Kroch,  Santorini  and  Delfs, 
2004;  Kroch  and  Taylor,  2000;  Santorini,  2010).  Thus, 
IcePaHC uses the same general type of labeled bracketing 
as  the  Penn  Treebank  (with  dash-separated  lemmata 
added) as shown below: 
 

( (IP-MAT (NP-SBJ (PRO-N Hann-hann)) 
        (VBDI spurði-spyrja) 
        (CP-QUE (WADVP-1 (WADV hvernig-hvernig)) 
              (C 0) 
              (IP-SUB (ADVP *T*-1) 
                    (NP-SBJ(NPR-D Grími-grímur)) 
                    (VBDS liði-líða)))) 
(ID 1888.GRIMUR.NAR-FIC,.301)) 
 
This  proved  to  be  a  very  fortunate  decision.  The  Penn 
annotation  scheme  has  already  been  adapted  for  Old 
English  (Taylor  et  al,.  2003),  which  is  rather  similar  to 
Icelandic in many respects, both as regards the syntax and 
the  morphological  system.  Thus,  the  scheme  could  be 
applied to Icelandic with only slight modifications. Fur-
thermore, the Penn team has written extensive annotation 
guidelines  which  were  of  tremendous  help  in  our  work 
(Santorini,  2010).  We  were  careful  to  write  our  own 
guidelines  and  document  all  deviations  from  and  addi-
tions to the Penn guidelines. 

1979

The decision to model our annotation on the Penn anno-
tation system also meant that we could use the software 
that has been written especially to facilitate the annotation 
(CorpusDraw)  and  to  search  the  corpus  (CorpusSearch; 
Randall, 2005). An extra bonus is that it is now very easy 
to compare Icelandic and older stages of English. We can 
write search queries for English in CorpusSearch and by 
and  large  use  the  same  queries  for  Icelandic,  although 
minor  modifications  are  sometimes  necessary.  Further-
more,  Penn-style  treebanks  have  been  built  or  are  cur-
rently being built for a number of other languages, such as 
French  (Martineu  et  al.,  2010),  Portuguese  (Galves  and 
Britto, 2002), Early High German (Light, 2010), Classical 
Greek (Beck, 2011), Yiddish (Santorini, 1997/2008), and 
more.  This  development  means  that  cross-linguistic, 
comparative  diachronic  studies  can  be  carried  out  in  a 
controlled  and  reproducible  way  with  the  same  search 
queries across these datasets. 
Yet  another  reason  for  choosing  the  Penn  annotation 
system  was  that  it  is  relatively  rich,  compared  to  most 
dependency-based schemes. Thus, it should – in principle, 
at  least  –  be  possible  to  convert  our  treebank  to  a  de-
pendency  treebank,  although  some  information  will  be 
lost in the conversion. Going the other way, that is, con-
verting  a  dependency-based  treebank  to  a  Penn-style 
phrase  structure  treebank,  would,  on  the  other  hand,  be 
impossible without adding information. 
Even though we followed the Penn scheme in most cases, 
we found it necessary to make some slight modifications, 
as mentioned above. The most important of these are that 
we annotate the words for lemma and nominals also for 
case,  neither  of  which  is  done  in  the  English  historical 
corpora (excepting case in Old English). 

4.2  The annotation process 
After  the  texts  had  been  converted  to  modern  Icelandic 
spelling, they were handed over to student assistants who 
had the task of dividing them into clauses. Some periods 
do  not  signal  the  end  of  a  tree  and  not  all  trees  end  in 
periods.  Sentence  boundary  detection  for  English  has 
been  shown  to  classify  periods  such  that  98.5%  of  sen-
tences boundaries are correctly identified, a considerable 
improvement over the 90% precision of a baseline clas-
sifier  which  assumes  every  period  to  be  a  boundary 
(Palmer  and  Hearst,  1994).  While  this  may  seem  en-
couraging  we  have  two  good  reasons  for  preferring  a 
manual approach to clause boundary detection. 
First,  while  rules  for  classifying  periods  as  boundary 
marking  or  not  are  fairly  simple,  the  rules  for  inserting 
clause  boundaries  (usually  between  well-formed  matrix 
clauses  but  sometimes  sentence  fragments  without 
enough  material  to  reconstruct  clausal  structure  reliably 
and  consistently)  are  more  complicated  and  require  in-
terpretation  of  gapping  structures  where  the  nature  and 
amount of omitted material affects the boundary status of 
conjunctive elements. Such problems can in principle be 
addressed using computational methods but the required 
tools  are  not  currently  available  for  Icelandic  and  their 
development was beyond the scope of our project. 

Second,  while  clause  boundary  detection  is  not  a  trivial 
computational task it is fairly simple for a human and this 
part of the annotation could be carried out fast and reliably 
by research assistants which did not have to be trained in 
the complexities of full phrase structure annotation. 
After running IceNLP we ran a few programs developed 
within the project to prepare the text for manual annota-
tion.  The  PoS  tagset  was  converted  to  a  format  nearly 
identical to the Penn Parsed Corpora of Historical English, 
the format of the labeled bracketing was converted to the 
Penn  treebank  format  for  compatibility  with  existing 
software  and  various  structures  were  partially  annotated 
using  CorpusSearch  revision  queries  (Randall,  2005). 
Such partial annotation includes building the left edge of 
subordinate  clauses  whose  right  edge  is  subsequently 
determined by a human annotator.  
The manual annotation phase comprised the bulk of the 
work. In the beginning, we used the CorpusDraw software 
to correct the parse, but we soon realized that it would be 
possible to speed up the annotation if we had software that 
was  better  suited  for  the  task.  Therefore,  we  wrote  the 
annotation tool Annotald which made it possible to speed 
up  the  annotation  considerably.  Annotald  is  a  browser 
based  cross-platform  visual  tree  editor  which  combines 
keyboard and mouse shortcuts such that the annotator can 
always keep the left hand on the keyboard and the right 
hand  on  the  mouse.  This  avoids  moving  the  right  hand 
back and forth between mouse and keyboard which leads 
to  improved  speed  and  accuracy  over  CorpusDraw  (see 
Figure 1 for the overall impact of improved methods and 
training  on  tree  production).  Annotald  is  released  under 
the  GPL  license  and  continues  to  be  developed  by  a 
growing  team  of  programmers  at  the  University  of 
Pennsylvania (Beck, Ecay and Ingason, 2011). 
 

 

Figure 1: The annotation process 

 
Three annotators worked on the project. In the beginning, 
they reviewed each other’s work and spent a lot of time 
consulting the annotation manual for the Penn Historical 
Corpora (Santorini, 2010), which we succeeded in adapt-
ing  to  Icelandic.  When  the  annotators  had  become  well 
acquainted  with  the  annotation  scheme  and  developed 
special  annotation  rules  for  most  of  the  cases  where 
Icelandic  deviates  from  Old(er)  English,  they  stopped 
reviewing  each  other’s  annotations  and  placed  the  em-

1980

phasis on speeding up the annotation as much as possible. 
Figure  1  shows  the  annotation  progress  for  the  whole 
project period. 
We are in no doubt that the speed of the annotation proc-
ess, and the fact that a large part of the annotation has not 
been reviewed, has resulted in a considerable number of 
annotation  errors  and  discrepancies.  The  errors  are  nev-
ertheless a small minority of potential errors. Our current 
approach to correction is to systematically enforce more 
constraints  on  well-formed  structures.  For  example,  the 
latest  release  of  the  corpus  (Wallenberg  et  al.  2011)  in-
correctly contains 51 clauses with two phrases labeled as 
direct  objects  (NP-OB1).  This  is  about  1%  of  the  4727 
double  object  clauses  in  the  corpus  and  in  most  of  the 
cases one of the two objects should be labeled as an in-
direct object (NP-OB2). 
These errors and many more have been corrected for the 
next release of the corpus. However, we want to empha-
size that the corpus is  meant  to be used  for quantitative 
research,  not  qualitative.  It  is  not  possible  to  take  the 
parsing of any single sentence from the corpus and rely on 
it  without  reflection.  The  reasons  are  both  that  the  text 
may  be  of  disputable  age  and  the  parse  may  contain  an 
error.  However,  we  believe  that  the  quantity  of  the  text 
and  its  overall  quality  make  the  corpus  safe  to  use  in 
quantitative studies and the quality will only improve as 
future users notify us of errors they catch in their work. 

5.  A Spin-off: FarPaHC 

5.1  Background 
Since  we  believe  the  model  we  used  in  the  building  of 
IcePaHC was highly successful, we wanted to extend this 
model  to  a  related  less-resourced  language  and  build  a 
Faroese  Parsed  Historical  Corpus,  FarPaHC.  Faroese  is 
spoken by 48,000 people in the Faroe Islands, 25,000 in 
Denmark and 5,000 people in Iceland (http://fo.wikipedia. 
org/wiki/Føroyskt_mál). The closest relative of Faroese is 
Icelandic and the two languages share a number of prop-
erties.  Both  languages  have  rich  case  morphology  (four 
cases) and nominals and adjectives also inflect for number 
and gender. A native speaker of Icelandic can read written 
Faroese (and vice versa), though the spoken languages are 
just  different  enough  to  not  be  mutually  intelligible 
without considerable effort. 
Our  goal  is  to  build  a  250,000  word  fully  parsed,  PoS 
tagged  and  lemmatized  corpus  of  19th-21st  century 
Faroese. The reason why we do not have older texts is that 
Faroese literary tradition is so short. Since IcePaHC con-
sists mostly of religious texts and narratives, we focus on 
balancing FarPaHC for the same genres, which will help 
to  control  for  social  and  stylistic  factors  when  syntactic 
change  and  stability  in  Icelandic  and  Faroese  are  com-
pared.  This  means  that  most  texts  in  the  treebank  date 
from the 19th century to the present. In IcePaHC, around 
100,000  words  were  parsed  for  each  century  with  the 
exception  that  there  is  only  a  little  more  than  40,000 
words from the 12th and the 21st century each. In light of 
this,  our  aim  for  FarPaHC  is  to  parse  200,000  words  in 

total from texts dating from the 19th and 20th century and 
50,000 words from the 21st century. The main reason for 
our modest goal of 250,000 words is that there is only one 
annotator working on the project. 
Our  method  of  text  selection  within  these  genres  is  pri-
marily  in  order  to  facilitate  cross-linguistic  comparison, 
especially  with  Icelandic,  English,  and  other  Germanic 
languages,  but  it  is  also  partly  opportunistic.  We  try  to 
find texts that are already digitized because it costs money 
and  time  to  key  them  in  (and  even  more  to  transcribe 
manuscripts).  We  also  focus  on  parsing  texts  that  are 
parallel  translations  of  texts  found  in  IcePaHC  and 
PPCHE,  such  as  the  Gospel  of  John  and  Acts  of  the 
Apostles from the New Testament. We are also going to 
parse at least one Faroese version of a narrative found in 
IcePaHC. Such a text could be one of the Icelandic family 
sagas, for instance The Saga of Grettir the Strong (Grettis 
saga). The size of the samples from each text is intended 
to  be  similar  to  those  in  PPCHE  and  IcePaHC,  roughly 
20,000 words (when possible). 

for 

the 

5.2  Annotation 
When we started building FarPaHC we used the modified 
PPCHE scheme from IcePaHC. As pointed out above, this 
allows for easy crosslinguistic comparison, as well as for 
experimentation  in  developing  multilingual  taggers  and 
parsers. For more consistent parse we document our de-
cisions (http://linguist.is/farpahc/) and where possible, we 
follow 
PPCHE 
guidelines  written 
(http://www.ling.upenn.edu/hist-corpora/)  and  the  Ice-
PaHC  documentation  (http://linguist.is/icelandic_tree- 
bank/).  This  is  also  helpful  for  users  of  the  treebank. 
Morphologically  and  syntactically,  Faroese  resembles 
Icelandic in many ways. This makes it more important to 
follow the guidelines for IcePaHC and saves a lot of time 
because this decreases the number of decisions that need 
to be taken in the annotation process. 
Since the annotator in the FarPaHC project has experience 
from IcePaHC we do not have to spend time and money 
on training. If one can read Icelandic it is  fairly easy to 
read Faroese as well so the language does not either slow 
us down. However, for semi-automatic parsing we are not 
able  to  use  parsers,  morphological  taggers  and  lemma-
tizers  written  for  Faroese  –  we  must  rely  on  programs 
written  for  Icelandic,  especially  the  IceNLP  package 
which  was  used  in  the  IcePaHC  annotation.  This  de-
creases the parsing speed in the beginning of the project. 
Nevertheless,  we  use IceNLP in our annotation process, 
even though the tagger and lemmatizer produce a number 
of errors that they would not on Icelandic data. To correct 
this effect as efficiently as possible, we specify a number 
of  handwritten  rules  as  we  go  along  which  slows  the 
process down at  first.  We focus on  writing rules  for the 
most common words, e.g., pronouns, quantifiers, auxilia-
ries (HAVE and BE), modal verbs and function words, such 
as complementizers and prepositions. 
When we have run IceNLP on the raw data, we take the 
output and manually parse it with Annotald (Beck, Ecay 
and  Ingason,  2011;  cf.  above).  The  following  is  a  fully 

1981

parsed  (and  handcorrected)  token  in  FarPaHC  (the  sen-
tence  is  from  the  Gospel  of  John).  For  convenience  we 
leave out the glosses.

Since  FarPaHC  is  compatible  with,  e.g.,  IcePaHC  and 
PPCHE the same, or very similar, queries can be used. To 
demonstrate  this  we  show  the  same  sentence  from  the 
Gospel of John as above in IcePaHC and the Penn Parsed 
Corpus  of  Early  Modern  English  (Kroch,  Santorini  and 
Delfs, 2004), respectively.

We plan to publish the first version, 0.1, on June 1st. Every 
four months after that we plan to release a new version, 
with  more  words,  until  we  achieve  our  goal  of  250,000 
words. Even though the first release of the corpus will be 
rather  small,  probably  around  50,000  words,  it  can  be 
useful to have this resource in comparative syntactic re-
search,  especially  since  the  first  texts  that  we  parse,  the 
Gospel of John and the Acts of the Apostles, are found in 
other Penn style treebanks, such as IcePaHC and PPCHE. 
People who prefer dependency treebanks should be able 
to use it by converting our parse to a dependency parse. 
The first release will  nevertheless probably be too small 
for computational linguists to train data-driven tools. 

6.  Maximizing distribution 
and user freedom 
We believe strongly in the sharing of resources. True to 
that spirit, we decided at the beginning of the project that 
we wanted to make our work as open and widely distrib-
uted  as  possible.  To  emphasize  that,  we  defined  the 
following “10 basic types of user freedom”: 
 
1.  Raw data available can be downloaded for local use 

(corpus not hidden behind a search interface) 

2.  Comprehensive  documentation 

freely  available 

online 

3.  Available  without  registration,  user  identification  of 

some sort, or signing of contracts 

4.  Development  process  of  corpus  relies  only  on 
free/open source software tools (for transparent rep-
lication of annotation process) 

5.  Open  development  (annotation  is  carried  out  in  an 
open  online  version  control  repository  for  transpar-
ency  regarding  the  actual  steps  taken  in  the  devel-
opment and immediate access to work-in-progress) 
6.  Regular  scheduled  releases  of  numbered  versions 
during  development  as  well  as  for  more  permanent 
milestone  versions  so  that  researchers  can  always 
produce replicable results on a recent version of the 
corpus 

7.  Users  can  improve  the  corpus  and  release  modified 

versions without special permission 

8.  Free of cost to academia 
9.  Free of cost to commercial users 
10. Corpus released under a standard free license of some 
sort for straightforward compatibility with other pro-
jects (GPL, LGPL, CC, etc.) 

 
We decided not to wait until the treebank was finished to 
release it. Instead, we released a new version every three 
months, in the hope of incrementally building up a user 
base and getting feedback from users which we could use 
to  improve  the  treebank.  This  worked  very  well  –  for 
instance,  Version  0.4,  released  in  April  2011  and  con-
taining  around  440,000  words,  was  downloaded  (in  dif-
ferent  formats)  more  than  450  times  from  the  project 
website  (http://linguist.is/icelandic_treebank/Download). 
Furthermore,  the  treebank  had  already  been  used  in  a 
number of studies before the current version was released 
in August 2011 (e.g. Sapp, 2011; Ingason, Sigurðsson and 
Wallenberg, 2011; Light and Wallenberg, 2011). 
As  pointed  out  by  Muhonen  and  Purtonen  (2011),  it  is 
more difficult to gather information about the number of 
users of free treebanks than treebanks which require user 
registration, but we believe the benefits of user freedom 
outweigh such minor problems and in the course of time 
the impact of the treebank will be measured by its usage in 
published works rather than by raw download counts. 
We  follow  the  principles  listed  above  strictly  in  the  on-
going FarPaHC project. That involves regular scheduled 
releases before we reach our goal of 250,000 words. Re-
garding the  fifth pointer above (open development), our 
open online version control repository is found on github. 
The URL is https://github.com/antonkarl/icecorpus. 
Even though IcePaHC is practically finished, the current 
version is numbered 0.9 because some minor corrections 
remain to be made. The treebank is released in three ver-
sions;  a  zip-file  containing  the  raw  data  of  the  of  the 
corpus in labeled bracketing format; an easy-to-use setup 
executable  for  Windows  that  installs  the  corpus  and  a 
graphical  user  interface;  and  a  zip-file  containing  the 
corpus and a platform independent user interface in Java. 
The  treebank  has  also  been  uploaded  to  the  INESS  re-
pository at the University of Bergen (http://iness.uib.no) 
where it may be viewed and searched.

language resources under an open source license. This is 
especially  important  when  working  on  less-resourced 
languages  where  duplication  of  work  must  be  avoided. 
We  hope  that  other  researchers  will  follow  in  our  steps 
and make their resources and tools publicly available for 
the benefit of all.

7.  Conclusion 
In  this  paper,  we  have  described  the  parsed  historical 
corpus  of  Icelandic,  IcePaHC,  and  its  motivations.  As 
pointed  out  in  the  introduction,  the  corpus  was  built  in 
order to serve two purposes: first, to be used within lan-
guage technology to train parsers etc., and secondly, to be 
used as a tool for diachronic syntactic research.  
Its  usefulness  for  the  latter  purpose  has  already  been 
demonstrated.  For  instance,  four  papers  that  were  pre-
sented at the 13th Diachronic Generative Syntax Confer-
ence  (DiGS)  in  June  2011  made  use  of  the  corpus  (see 
http://www.ling.upenn.edu/Events/DIGS13/).  As  for  the 
first purpose, the corpus has not yet been put to use but 
there is no reason to doubt that it can serve that purpose 
too. The corpus contains around 300,000 words which can 
safely  be  considered  Modern  Icelandic  –  texts  from  the 
19th,  20th  and  21st  centuries.  That  is  more  than  enough 
material to train a statistical parser. The project has also 
created a spin-off in the Faroese parsed historical corpus, 
FarPaHC. 
As mentioned above, we believe that IcePaHC is unusual 
for a number of reasons. The most important one is that 
we  have  brought  together  a  group  of  researchers  who 
come from different fields and have different motives, but 
saw  the  benefits  of  joining  their  forces  in  building  an 
important language resource which serves a dual purpose. 
The interdisciplinarity of the team should ensure that both 
humanist  researchers  and  language  technologists  feel  at 
ease in using the corpus in their work. 
Finally,  we  emphasize  the  importance  of  distributing

Abstract 

We describe the background for and building of IcePaHC, a one million word parsed historical corpus of Icelandic which has just been 
finished. This corpus which is completely free and open contains fragments of 60 texts ranging from the late 12th century to the present. 
We describe the text selection and text collecting process and discuss the quality of the texts and their conversion to modern Icelandic 
spelling. We explain why we choose to use a phrase structure Penn style annotation scheme and briefly describe the syntactic anno-
tation process. We also describe a spin-off project which is only in its beginning stages: a parsed historical corpus of Faroese. Finally, 
we advocate the importance of an open source policy as regards language resources.  
 
Keywords: Icelandic, Faroese, treebank, parsed corpus, annotation 
 

1.  Introduction 
The parsed corpus, or treebank, reported on in this paper, 
Icelandic Parsed Historical Corpus or IcePaHC (Wallen-
berg et al., 2011) is the product of three different projects 
which  originally  had  different  aims.  The  earliest  and 
largest of these projects was a subpart of a large language 
technology project which had the aim of developing three 
different basic language resources for Icelandic. The aim 
of  this  subproject  was  to  build  a  treebank  of  Modern 
Icelandic for use in language technology and to develop 
efficient  parsing  methods  and  tools  for  less  resourced 
languages.  Since  some  of  the  participants  had  been  in-
volved  in  historical  syntax  research,  we  also  wanted  to 
include  a  few  texts  from  older  stages  of  the  language. 
However, the main emphasis was on language technology 
use  –  we  intended  to  use  the  texts  to  train  a  statistical 
parser for Modern Icelandic. 
At the same time, two other projects with the aim of de-
veloping  resources  for  studying  diachronic  Icelandic 
syntax  were  in  preparation.  After  some  discussion,  the 
participants in these three projects decided to join forces 
and make a combined effort to build a large parsed corpus 
covering the history of Icelandic syntax from the earliest 
sources up to the present. This corpus thus serves the dual 
purpose  of  being  one  of  the  cornerstones  of  Icelandic 
language technology and being an invaluable tool in Ice-
landic diachronic syntax research. 
The  corpus  is  now  finished  and  contains  one  million 
words. It has been made available through free download 
(http://linguist.is/icelandic_treebank/Download) – in fact, 
we  released  preliminary  versions  every  three  months 
through the whole project period. We believe the corpus is 
unusual in many ways. 
First, it is designed from the beginning to serve both as a 
language  technology  tool  and  a  syntactic  research  tool, 
and developed by people with research experience in both 
diachronic  syntax  and  computational  linguistics.  Most 
parsed  corpora  are  developed  either  for  language  tech-

nology  use  (such  as  the  Penn  Treebank,  http://www. 
cis.upenn.edu/~treebank/) or for syntactic research (such 
as the Penn Parsed Corpora of Historical English, PPCHE, 
http://www.ling.upenn.edu/hist-corpora/;  Kroch 
and 
Taylor, 2000; Kroch, Santorini and Delfs, 2004). 
Secondly,  the  corpus  spans  almost  ten  centuries  –  the 
oldest  texts  are  written  in  the  final  decades  of  the  12th 
century and the youngest are from the first decade of the 
21st  century.  As  far  as  we  know,  no  other  single  parsed 
corpus  comes  close  to  that.  Most  other  languages  have 
changed so much in the course of the last thousand years 
that it would be more challenging to apply the same an-
notation scheme for the whole period. 
Third, our corpus contains over one million words and is 
thus  among  the  largest  parsed  corpora  that  have  been 
published  for  any  language.  As  far  as  we  know,  only 
English and Czech have larger hand-checked treebanks. 
Fourth,  the  corpus  is  completely  free  and  open  without 
any registration or paperwork, and the same goes for all 
the software that has been used to build it and the software 
that was developed within the project. Both the software 
and  the  corpus  itself  are  distributed  under  the  LGPL  li-
cense. 

This paper describes the background of the treebank. In 
the next section, we explain how it is possible and why it 
is feasible to build a diachronic treebank spanning almost 
ten  centuries  in  the  history  of  Icelandic.  After  that,  we 
discuss several aspects of the  material in the  treebank – 
the selection of the texts, their quality, and their conver-
sion to modern Icelandic spelling. We then go on to ex-
plain  why  we  choose  to  build  a  Penn  style  treebank  in-
stead  of  a  dependency  treebank,  which  might  perhaps 
seem a more obvious choice. Following a short descrip-
tion  of  the  annotation  process,  we  briefly  describe  a 
spin-off  project:  a  parsed  historical  corpus  of  Faroese, 
FarPaHC, which is only in its beginning stages. Finally, 
we present our open source policy and set forth “10 basic 
types of user freedom” for language resources.

2.  The diachronic dimension 
Icelandic is a language with a rich literary heritage rang-
ing from the 12th century to the present. It is a commonly 
accepted  fact  that  Icelandic  morphosyntax  has  changed 
much less during the last thousand years than most other 
European languages. This has often been attributed to the 
strong  literary  tradition  and  the  isolation  of  the  country. 
However, it must be emphasized that some features of the 
language  have  in  fact  changed  considerably  since  Old 
Icelandic. Thus, the phonological system has undergone 
dramatic  changes,  especially  the  vowel  system.  The 
phonetic quality of many of the vowels has changed, and 
the quantity system has changed such that vowel length is 
now context-dependent instead of being fixed. 
On the other  hand, the  inflectional system and the  mor-
phology has in all relevant respects remained unchanged 
from the earliest texts up to the present, although a num-
ber of nouns have shifted inflectional class, a few strong 
verbs have become weak, one inflectional class of nouns 
has  been  lost,  and  the  dual  in  personal  and  possessive 
pronoun has disappeared. The syntax is also basically the 
same, although a number of changes have occurred. The 
changes mainly involve word order, especially within the 
verb  phrase,  and  the  development  of  new  modal  con-
structions (cf. for instance Rögnvaldsson and Helgadóttir, 
2011). 
Thus,  present-day  Icelanders  can  read  many  texts  from 
the  13th  century  without  special  training,  although  that 
doesn’t  necessarily  mean  that  they  can  read  the  texts 
directly  from  the  manuscripts.  There  was  no  accepted 
spelling  standard  until  the  20th  century,  and  the  same 
sounds, sound combinations and words can be written in 
many ways. However, since the morphology is the same, 
it  is  usually  relatively  straightforward  to  convert  older 
spelling to the modern standard and get legible text. 
These two features – the stability of the morphology and 
the changes in the syntax – are the reasons why it is both 
possible  and  feasible  to  build  one  treebank  with  texts 
spanning a period of ten centuries. If the  morphological 
system  had  changed  dramatically,  it  would  have  been 
difficult to apply the same annotation scheme to old and 
modern  texts.  On  the  other  hand,  the  known  syntactic 
changes  and  variation  do  not  greatly  complicate  the  an-
notation  scheme,  making  it  feasible  to  build  a  tool  that 
enables us to study these changes and variation in a sys-
tematic way. The parsed historical corpus is such a tool. 

3.  Texts 

3.1  Text selection 
Selecting texts to parse for the corpus was a challenging 
task. We wanted to have the corpus both representative of 
different text genres and comparable through the centuries. 
This  meant  that  we  excluded  some  genres  which  have 
emerged only recently, such as newspaper texts. We de-
cided  in  the  beginning  on  a  goal  of  parsing  one  million 
words  –  approximately  100,000  from  each  century  of 
Icelandic literary tradition. 
Our original plan was to have samples from five different 

genres of text for each century – preferably 20,000 words 
from each text. The genres we had in mind were narrative 
texts, religious texts, biographies, laws, and science. We 
knew  from the beginning that it would be impossible to 
reach this goal, simply because texts belonging to some of 
the genres do not exist from all 10 centuries. We started 
with  narrative texts and religious texts, since texts  from 
these two genres were easiest to get hold of. 
When  we  were  well  into  the  project,  we  decided  to 
abandon  the  original  plan  and  concentrate  on  these  two 
genres. Narrative texts are the overwhelming majority of 
preserved  medieval  texts,  and  those  which  have  been 
most  studied  and  are  easiest  to  get.  It  is  also  relatively 
easy  to  find  religious  texts  from  most  centuries,  but  bi-
ographies, laws, and scientific texts are much fewer and 
harder to find in edited editions. Thus, we decided to stick 
to the original plan of having around 100,000 words from 
each  century,  but  instead  of  dividing  this  evenly  among 
five genres, we aimed at having 80,000 words of narrative 
texts  and  20,000  words  of  religious  prose.  This  also  in-
creases the data set for the two genres, allowing for more 
reliable studies of style-shifting phenomena. 
By  and  large,  this  plan  could  be  upheld.  However,  we 
didn’t  manage  to  find  any  religious  text  that  could  be 
attributed to the 15th century, and it proved to be difficult 
to find enough narrative texts from the 16th through 18th 
centuries.  Instead,  we  included  more  of  religious  texts 
from the 16th century and some biographies from the 18th 
and  19th  centuries.  The  distribution  of  the  texts  across 
genres and centuries is shown in table 1.

Table 1: Text types 

 
The corpus contains (samples of) 60 different texts which 
came from various sources. Approximately 20 texts were 
taken from text repositories on the Internet, especially the 
Icelandic Netútgáfan (http://snerpa.is/net) but a few came 
from  the  Project  Gutenberg  website  (http://www.  guten-
berg.org), the Internet Archive (http://www.archive.org/) 
and  the  Medieval  Nordic  Text  Archive  (http://www. 
menota.org/).  Around  10  texts  came  from  the  Árni 
Magnússon  Institute  text  archive  (http://www.lexis.hi.is/ 
corpus/).  We  received  around  10  texts  directly  from 
scholars  who  have  been  editing  them  or  publishing 
companies that had published them. The remaining texts,

around 20, were keyed in for us by students working on 
the project. Four texts from the 20th and 21st centuries are 
still  under  copyright,  but  we  contacted  the  authors  who 
gave us permission to use them. 

3.2  Text quality 
The  quality  of  the  texts  varies  a  lot.  Very  few  Old  Ice-
landic texts are preserved in the original, and exact dating 
of the texts is often very difficult. Usually, the preserved 
manuscripts are assumed to be several decades and even 
centuries younger than the original text. We know that the 
scribes  did  not  copy  the  manuscripts  letter  for  letter  – 
often they just used their own spelling instead of retaining 
the spelling of the original. This makes it very difficult to 
use the text to study phonology and morphology (cf. for 
instance Bernharðsson, 1999). 
For those who use the text to study syntax and syntactic 
change, however, this is not a serious drawback, although 
in exceptional cases case distinctions in endings may be 
lost  due  to  phonological  changes  and/or  changes  in 
spelling.  On  the  other  hand,  it  is  usually  assumed  that 
scribes  more  or  less  retained  the  word  order  and  other 
syntactic  features  of  the  manuscript  they  were  copying, 
although there are a number of known exceptions to this. 
The  treebank  is  accompanied  by  detailed  “info”  files 
which users can consult and make their own decisions on 
using or disregarding data from certain texts.  

3.3 Text conversion 
We decided to convert all our texts to  modern Icelandic 
spelling.  There  were  two  reasons  for  this.  One  was  that 
this  makes  it  possible  to  search  for  individual  words 
without  having  to  capture  all  possible  spelling  variants 
using fuzzy search, regular expressions and the like. The 
main  reason  was,  however,  that  we  wanted  to  use  the 
open-source  IceNLP  package  for  preprocessing.  This 
package  (available  at  http://icenlp.sourceforge.net)  con-
tains a tokenizer, a PoS tagger, a lemmatizer, and a shal-
low parser (Loftsson, 2008; Loftsson and Rögnvaldsson, 
2007;  Ingason  et  al.,  2008).  It  was  written  for  Modern 
Icelandic texts and its dictionary assumes that words have 
Modern Icelandic spelling. If  we had given the package 
input in the original spelling of each text, the result of the 
preprocessing would have been much poorer. 
All major texts from the medieval period have been pub-
lished, although the editions are not always as good as one 
would wish. Many texts from the 16th up to the 19th cen-
tury, however, have never been published. We decided in 
the beginning that we would only use texts from printed 
sources  –  it  would  have  been  prohibitively  time-  con-
suming and expensive to digitize texts from manuscripts. 
Editions  of  medieval  Icelandic  texts  have  one  of  three 
formats: 1) Diplomatic editions, where the text is printed 
exactly as in the manuscripts. 2) Standardized Old Norse 
spelling, which is a standard developed in the 19th century 
and is meant to mirror the sound system of 13th century 
Icelandic. 3) Modern Icelandic spelling. For most of the 
20th  century,  editions  of  medieval  texts  intended  for  the 
public were usually in the standardized Old Norse spell-

ing. Since the 1970s, however, it has become customary 
to use modern Icelandic spelling in new editions of me-
dieval  texts,  even  though  editions  mainly  aimed  at 
scholars  usually  try  to  mirror  the  spelling  of  the  manu-
script as closely as possible. Texts from the 19th century 
onwards  usually  only  have  minor  deviations  from  the 
modern spelling.  
A number of texts were in modern Icelandic spelling and 
could  be  used  as  they  were.  However,  the  majority  of 
them  were  either  in  standardized  Old  Norse  spelling  or 
diplomatic, and thus had to be changed. For the texts in 
the standardized Old Norse spelling, the task was rather 
easy, and a few simple scripts could be used to make most 
of the changes. The diplomatic editions were much harder. 
Some  scripts  and  simple  search-and-replace  could  help, 
but  since  the  spelling  in  these  texts  is  often  highly  ir-
regular, we had to go over them word by word and correct 
them, which was rather tedious and time-consuming.  

4.  Annotation 

4.1  Annotation scheme 
One  of  the  main  questions  which  had  to  be  answered 
before  the  annotation  started  was  which  annotation 
scheme to use. Most of the treebanks that have been built 
for the Scandinavian languages use some  version of de-
pendency parsing (e.g. Kromann, 2003; Bick, 2003; Nivre, 
Nilsson and Hall, 2006), so in some sense it would have 
been most natural for us to follow them. However, we had 
close contacts with the treebank team at the University of 
Pennsylvania  from  the  early  stages  of  the  project,  so  it 
was  a  natural  choice  for  us  to  use  the  phrase  structure 
annotation  scheme  that  they  have  developed  for  their 
parsed  historical  corpora  (Kroch,  Santorini  and  Delfs, 
2004;  Kroch  and  Taylor,  2000;  Santorini,  2010).  Thus, 
IcePaHC uses the same general type of labeled bracketing 
as  the  Penn  Treebank  (with  dash-separated  lemmata 
added) as shown below: 
 

( (IP-MAT (NP-SBJ (PRO-N Hann-hann)) 
        (VBDI spurði-spyrja) 
        (CP-QUE (WADVP-1 (WADV hvernig-hvernig)) 
              (C 0) 
              (IP-SUB (ADVP *T*-1) 
                    (NP-SBJ(NPR-D Grími-grímur)) 
                    (VBDS liði-líða)))) 
(ID 1888.GRIMUR.NAR-FIC,.301)) 
 
This  proved  to  be  a  very  fortunate  decision.  The  Penn 
annotation  scheme  has  already  been  adapted  for  Old 
English  (Taylor  et  al,.  2003),  which  is  rather  similar  to 
Icelandic in many respects, both as regards the syntax and 
the  morphological  system.  Thus,  the  scheme  could  be 
applied to Icelandic with only slight modifications. Fur-
thermore, the Penn team has written extensive annotation 
guidelines  which  were  of  tremendous  help  in  our  work 
(Santorini,  2010).  We  were  careful  to  write  our  own 
guidelines  and  document  all  deviations  from  and  addi-
tions to the Penn guidelines. 

1979

The decision to model our annotation on the Penn anno-
tation system also meant that we could use the software 
that has been written especially to facilitate the annotation 
(CorpusDraw)  and  to  search  the  corpus  (CorpusSearch; 
Randall, 2005). An extra bonus is that it is now very easy 
to compare Icelandic and older stages of English. We can 
write search queries for English in CorpusSearch and by 
and  large  use  the  same  queries  for  Icelandic,  although 
minor  modifications  are  sometimes  necessary.  Further-
more,  Penn-style  treebanks  have  been  built  or  are  cur-
rently being built for a number of other languages, such as 
French  (Martineu  et  al.,  2010),  Portuguese  (Galves  and 
Britto, 2002), Early High German (Light, 2010), Classical 
Greek (Beck, 2011), Yiddish (Santorini, 1997/2008), and 
more.  This  development  means  that  cross-linguistic, 
comparative  diachronic  studies  can  be  carried  out  in  a 
controlled  and  reproducible  way  with  the  same  search 
queries across these datasets. 
Yet  another  reason  for  choosing  the  Penn  annotation 
system  was  that  it  is  relatively  rich,  compared  to  most 
dependency-based schemes. Thus, it should – in principle, 
at  least  –  be  possible  to  convert  our  treebank  to  a  de-
pendency  treebank,  although  some  information  will  be 
lost in the conversion. Going the other way, that is, con-
verting  a  dependency-based  treebank  to  a  Penn-style 
phrase  structure  treebank,  would,  on  the  other  hand,  be 
impossible without adding information. 
Even though we followed the Penn scheme in most cases, 
we found it necessary to make some slight modifications, 
as mentioned above. The most important of these are that 
we annotate the words for lemma and nominals also for 
case,  neither  of  which  is  done  in  the  English  historical 
corpora (excepting case in Old English). 

4.2  The annotation process 
After  the  texts  had  been  converted  to  modern  Icelandic 
spelling, they were handed over to student assistants who 
had the task of dividing them into clauses. Some periods 
do  not  signal  the  end  of  a  tree  and  not  all  trees  end  in 
periods.  Sentence  boundary  detection  for  English  has 
been  shown  to  classify  periods  such  that  98.5%  of  sen-
tences boundaries are correctly identified, a considerable 
improvement over the 90% precision of a baseline clas-
sifier  which  assumes  every  period  to  be  a  boundary 
(Palmer  and  Hearst,  1994).  While  this  may  seem  en-
couraging  we  have  two  good  reasons  for  preferring  a 
manual approach to clause boundary detection. 
First,  while  rules  for  classifying  periods  as  boundary 
marking  or  not  are  fairly  simple,  the  rules  for  inserting 
clause  boundaries  (usually  between  well-formed  matrix 
clauses  but  sometimes  sentence  fragments  without 
enough  material  to  reconstruct  clausal  structure  reliably 
and  consistently)  are  more  complicated  and  require  in-
terpretation  of  gapping  structures  where  the  nature  and 
amount of omitted material affects the boundary status of 
conjunctive elements. Such problems can in principle be 
addressed using computational methods but the required 
tools  are  not  currently  available  for  Icelandic  and  their 
development was beyond the scope of our project. 

Second,  while  clause  boundary  detection  is  not  a  trivial 
computational task it is fairly simple for a human and this 
part of the annotation could be carried out fast and reliably 
by research assistants which did not have to be trained in 
the complexities of full phrase structure annotation. 
After running IceNLP we ran a few programs developed 
within the project to prepare the text for manual annota-
tion.  The  PoS  tagset  was  converted  to  a  format  nearly 
identical to the Penn Parsed Corpora of Historical English, 
the format of the labeled bracketing was converted to the 
Penn  treebank  format  for  compatibility  with  existing 
software  and  various  structures  were  partially  annotated 
using  CorpusSearch  revision  queries  (Randall,  2005). 
Such partial annotation includes building the left edge of 
subordinate  clauses  whose  right  edge  is  subsequently 
determined by a human annotator.  
The manual annotation phase comprised the bulk of the 
work. In the beginning, we used the CorpusDraw software 
to correct the parse, but we soon realized that it would be 
possible to speed up the annotation if we had software that 
was  better  suited  for  the  task.  Therefore,  we  wrote  the 
annotation tool Annotald which made it possible to speed 
up  the  annotation  considerably.  Annotald  is  a  browser 
based  cross-platform  visual  tree  editor  which  combines 
keyboard and mouse shortcuts such that the annotator can 
always keep the left hand on the keyboard and the right 
hand  on  the  mouse.  This  avoids  moving  the  right  hand 
back and forth between mouse and keyboard which leads 
to  improved  speed  and  accuracy  over  CorpusDraw  (see 
Figure 1 for the overall impact of improved methods and 
training  on  tree  production).  Annotald  is  released  under 
the  GPL  license  and  continues  to  be  developed  by  a 
growing  team  of  programmers  at  the  University  of 
Pennsylvania (Beck, Ecay and Ingason, 2011). 
 

 

Figure 1: The annotation process 

 
Three annotators worked on the project. In the beginning, 
they reviewed each other’s work and spent a lot of time 
consulting the annotation manual for the Penn Historical 
Corpora (Santorini, 2010), which we succeeded in adapt-
ing  to  Icelandic.  When  the  annotators  had  become  well 
acquainted  with  the  annotation  scheme  and  developed 
special  annotation  rules  for  most  of  the  cases  where 
Icelandic  deviates  from  Old(er)  English,  they  stopped 
reviewing  each  other’s  annotations  and  placed  the  em-

1980

phasis on speeding up the annotation as much as possible. 
Figure  1  shows  the  annotation  progress  for  the  whole 
project period. 
We are in no doubt that the speed of the annotation proc-
ess, and the fact that a large part of the annotation has not 
been reviewed, has resulted in a considerable number of 
annotation  errors  and  discrepancies.  The  errors  are  nev-
ertheless a small minority of potential errors. Our current 
approach to correction is to systematically enforce more 
constraints  on  well-formed  structures.  For  example,  the 
latest  release  of  the  corpus  (Wallenberg  et  al.  2011)  in-
correctly contains 51 clauses with two phrases labeled as 
direct  objects  (NP-OB1).  This  is  about  1%  of  the  4727 
double  object  clauses  in  the  corpus  and  in  most  of  the 
cases one of the two objects should be labeled as an in-
direct object (NP-OB2). 
These errors and many more have been corrected for the 
next release of the corpus. However, we want to empha-
size that the corpus is  meant  to be used  for quantitative 
research,  not  qualitative.  It  is  not  possible  to  take  the 
parsing of any single sentence from the corpus and rely on 
it  without  reflection.  The  reasons  are  both  that  the  text 
may  be  of  disputable  age  and  the  parse  may  contain  an 
error.  However,  we  believe  that  the  quantity  of  the  text 
and  its  overall  quality  make  the  corpus  safe  to  use  in 
quantitative studies and the quality will only improve as 
future users notify us of errors they catch in their work. 

5.  A Spin-off: FarPaHC 

5.1  Background 
Since  we  believe  the  model  we  used  in  the  building  of 
IcePaHC was highly successful, we wanted to extend this 
model  to  a  related  less-resourced  language  and  build  a 
Faroese  Parsed  Historical  Corpus,  FarPaHC.  Faroese  is 
spoken by 48,000 people in the Faroe Islands, 25,000 in 
Denmark and 5,000 people in Iceland (http://fo.wikipedia. 
org/wiki/Føroyskt_mál). The closest relative of Faroese is 
Icelandic and the two languages share a number of prop-
erties.  Both  languages  have  rich  case  morphology  (four 
cases) and nominals and adjectives also inflect for number 
and gender. A native speaker of Icelandic can read written 
Faroese (and vice versa), though the spoken languages are 
just  different  enough  to  not  be  mutually  intelligible 
without considerable effort. 
Our  goal  is  to  build  a  250,000  word  fully  parsed,  PoS 
tagged  and  lemmatized  corpus  of  19th-21st  century 
Faroese. The reason why we do not have older texts is that 
Faroese literary tradition is so short. Since IcePaHC con-
sists mostly of religious texts and narratives, we focus on 
balancing FarPaHC for the same genres, which will help 
to  control  for  social  and  stylistic  factors  when  syntactic 
change  and  stability  in  Icelandic  and  Faroese  are  com-
pared.  This  means  that  most  texts  in  the  treebank  date 
from the 19th century to the present. In IcePaHC, around 
100,000  words  were  parsed  for  each  century  with  the 
exception  that  there  is  only  a  little  more  than  40,000 
words from the 12th and the 21st century each. In light of 
this,  our  aim  for  FarPaHC  is  to  parse  200,000  words  in 

total from texts dating from the 19th and 20th century and 
50,000 words from the 21st century. The main reason for 
our modest goal of 250,000 words is that there is only one 
annotator working on the project. 
Our  method  of  text  selection  within  these  genres  is  pri-
marily  in  order  to  facilitate  cross-linguistic  comparison, 
especially  with  Icelandic,  English,  and  other  Germanic 
languages,  but  it  is  also  partly  opportunistic.  We  try  to 
find texts that are already digitized because it costs money 
and  time  to  key  them  in  (and  even  more  to  transcribe 
manuscripts).  We  also  focus  on  parsing  texts  that  are 
parallel  translations  of  texts  found  in  IcePaHC  and 
PPCHE,  such  as  the  Gospel  of  John  and  Acts  of  the 
Apostles from the New Testament. We are also going to 
parse at least one Faroese version of a narrative found in 
IcePaHC. Such a text could be one of the Icelandic family 
sagas, for instance The Saga of Grettir the Strong (Grettis 
saga). The size of the samples from each text is intended 
to  be  similar  to  those  in  PPCHE  and  IcePaHC,  roughly 
20,000 words (when possible). 

for 

the 

5.2  Annotation 
When we started building FarPaHC we used the modified 
PPCHE scheme from IcePaHC. As pointed out above, this 
allows for easy crosslinguistic comparison, as well as for 
experimentation  in  developing  multilingual  taggers  and 
parsers. For more consistent parse we document our de-
cisions (http://linguist.is/farpahc/) and where possible, we 
follow 
PPCHE 
guidelines  written 
(http://www.ling.upenn.edu/hist-corpora/)  and  the  Ice-
PaHC  documentation  (http://linguist.is/icelandic_tree- 
bank/).  This  is  also  helpful  for  users  of  the  treebank. 
Morphologically  and  syntactically,  Faroese  resembles 
Icelandic in many ways. This makes it more important to 
follow the guidelines for IcePaHC and saves a lot of time 
because this decreases the number of decisions that need 
to be taken in the annotation process. 
Since the annotator in the FarPaHC project has experience 
from IcePaHC we do not have to spend time and money 
on training. If one can read Icelandic it is  fairly easy to 
read Faroese as well so the language does not either slow 
us down. However, for semi-automatic parsing we are not 
able  to  use  parsers,  morphological  taggers  and  lemma-
tizers  written  for  Faroese  –  we  must  rely  on  programs 
written  for  Icelandic,  especially  the  IceNLP  package 
which  was  used  in  the  IcePaHC  annotation.  This  de-
creases the parsing speed in the beginning of the project. 
Nevertheless,  we  use IceNLP in our annotation process, 
even though the tagger and lemmatizer produce a number 
of errors that they would not on Icelandic data. To correct 
this effect as efficiently as possible, we specify a number 
of  handwritten  rules  as  we  go  along  which  slows  the 
process down at  first.  We focus on  writing rules  for the 
most common words, e.g., pronouns, quantifiers, auxilia-
ries (HAVE and BE), modal verbs and function words, such 
as complementizers and prepositions. 
When we have run IceNLP on the raw data, we take the 
output and manually parse it with Annotald (Beck, Ecay 
and  Ingason,  2011;  cf.  above).  The  following  is  a  fully 

1981

parsed  (and  handcorrected)  token  in  FarPaHC  (the  sen-
tence  is  from  the  Gospel  of  John).  For  convenience  we 
leave out the glosses.

Since  FarPaHC  is  compatible  with,  e.g.,  IcePaHC  and 
PPCHE the same, or very similar, queries can be used. To 
demonstrate  this  we  show  the  same  sentence  from  the 
Gospel of John as above in IcePaHC and the Penn Parsed 
Corpus  of  Early  Modern  English  (Kroch,  Santorini  and 
Delfs, 2004), respectively.

We plan to publish the first version, 0.1, on June 1st. Every 
four months after that we plan to release a new version, 
with  more  words,  until  we  achieve  our  goal  of  250,000 
words. Even though the first release of the corpus will be 
rather  small,  probably  around  50,000  words,  it  can  be 
useful to have this resource in comparative syntactic re-
search,  especially  since  the  first  texts  that  we  parse,  the 
Gospel of John and the Acts of the Apostles, are found in 
other Penn style treebanks, such as IcePaHC and PPCHE. 
People who prefer dependency treebanks should be able 
to use it by converting our parse to a dependency parse. 
The first release will  nevertheless probably be too small 
for computational linguists to train data-driven tools. 

6.  Maximizing distribution 
and user freedom 
We believe strongly in the sharing of resources. True to 
that spirit, we decided at the beginning of the project that 
we wanted to make our work as open and widely distrib-
uted  as  possible.  To  emphasize  that,  we  defined  the 
following “10 basic types of user freedom”: 
 
1.  Raw data available can be downloaded for local use 

(corpus not hidden behind a search interface) 

2.  Comprehensive  documentation 

freely  available 

online 

3.  Available  without  registration,  user  identification  of 

some sort, or signing of contracts 

4.  Development  process  of  corpus  relies  only  on 
free/open source software tools (for transparent rep-
lication of annotation process) 

5.  Open  development  (annotation  is  carried  out  in  an 
open  online  version  control  repository  for  transpar-
ency  regarding  the  actual  steps  taken  in  the  devel-
opment and immediate access to work-in-progress) 
6.  Regular  scheduled  releases  of  numbered  versions 
during  development  as  well  as  for  more  permanent 
milestone  versions  so  that  researchers  can  always 
produce replicable results on a recent version of the 
corpus 

7.  Users  can  improve  the  corpus  and  release  modified 

versions without special permission 

8.  Free of cost to academia 
9.  Free of cost to commercial users 
10. Corpus released under a standard free license of some 
sort for straightforward compatibility with other pro-
jects (GPL, LGPL, CC, etc.) 

 
We decided not to wait until the treebank was finished to 
release it. Instead, we released a new version every three 
months, in the hope of incrementally building up a user 
base and getting feedback from users which we could use 
to  improve  the  treebank.  This  worked  very  well  –  for 
instance,  Version  0.4,  released  in  April  2011  and  con-
taining  around  440,000  words,  was  downloaded  (in  dif-
ferent  formats)  more  than  450  times  from  the  project 
website  (http://linguist.is/icelandic_treebank/Download). 
Furthermore,  the  treebank  had  already  been  used  in  a 
number of studies before the current version was released 
in August 2011 (e.g. Sapp, 2011; Ingason, Sigurðsson and 
Wallenberg, 2011; Light and Wallenberg, 2011). 
As  pointed  out  by  Muhonen  and  Purtonen  (2011),  it  is 
more difficult to gather information about the number of 
users of free treebanks than treebanks which require user 
registration, but we believe the benefits of user freedom 
outweigh such minor problems and in the course of time 
the impact of the treebank will be measured by its usage in 
published works rather than by raw download counts. 
We  follow  the  principles  listed  above  strictly  in  the  on-
going FarPaHC project. That involves regular scheduled 
releases before we reach our goal of 250,000 words. Re-
garding the  fifth pointer above (open development), our 
open online version control repository is found on github. 
The URL is https://github.com/antonkarl/icecorpus. 
Even though IcePaHC is practically finished, the current 
version is numbered 0.9 because some minor corrections 
remain to be made. The treebank is released in three ver-
sions;  a  zip-file  containing  the  raw  data  of  the  of  the 
corpus in labeled bracketing format; an easy-to-use setup 
executable  for  Windows  that  installs  the  corpus  and  a 
graphical  user  interface;  and  a  zip-file  containing  the 
corpus and a platform independent user interface in Java. 
The  treebank  has  also  been  uploaded  to  the  INESS  re-
pository at the University of Bergen (http://iness.uib.no) 
where it may be viewed and searched.

language resources under an open source license. This is 
especially  important  when  working  on  less-resourced 
languages  where  duplication  of  work  must  be  avoided. 
We  hope  that  other  researchers  will  follow  in  our  steps 
and make their resources and tools publicly available for 
the benefit of all.

7.  Conclusion 
In  this  paper,  we  have  described  the  parsed  historical 
corpus  of  Icelandic,  IcePaHC,  and  its  motivations.  As 
pointed  out  in  the  introduction,  the  corpus  was  built  in 
order to serve two purposes: first, to be used within lan-
guage technology to train parsers etc., and secondly, to be 
used as a tool for diachronic syntactic research.  
Its  usefulness  for  the  latter  purpose  has  already  been 
demonstrated.  For  instance,  four  papers  that  were  pre-
sented at the 13th Diachronic Generative Syntax Confer-
ence  (DiGS)  in  June  2011  made  use  of  the  corpus  (see 
http://www.ling.upenn.edu/Events/DIGS13/).  As  for  the 
first purpose, the corpus has not yet been put to use but 
there is no reason to doubt that it can serve that purpose 
too. The corpus contains around 300,000 words which can 
safely  be  considered  Modern  Icelandic  –  texts  from  the 
19th,  20th  and  21st  centuries.  That  is  more  than  enough 
material to train a statistical parser. The project has also 
created a spin-off in the Faroese parsed historical corpus, 
FarPaHC. 
As mentioned above, we believe that IcePaHC is unusual 
for a number of reasons. The most important one is that 
we  have  brought  together  a  group  of  researchers  who 
come from different fields and have different motives, but 
saw  the  benefits  of  joining  their  forces  in  building  an 
important language resource which serves a dual purpose. 
The interdisciplinarity of the team should ensure that both 
humanist  researchers  and  language  technologists  feel  at 
ease in using the corpus in their work. 
Finally,  we  emphasize  the  importance  of  distributing

Abstract 

We describe the background for and building of IcePaHC, a one million word parsed historical corpus of Icelandic which has just been 
finished. This corpus which is completely free and open contains fragments of 60 texts ranging from the late 12th century to the present. 
We describe the text selection and text collecting process and discuss the quality of the texts and their conversion to modern Icelandic 
spelling. We explain why we choose to use a phrase structure Penn style annotation scheme and briefly describe the syntactic anno-
tation process. We also describe a spin-off project which is only in its beginning stages: a parsed historical corpus of Faroese. Finally, 
we advocate the importance of an open source policy as regards language resources.  
 
Keywords: Icelandic, Faroese, treebank, parsed corpus, annotation 
 

1.  Introduction 
The parsed corpus, or treebank, reported on in this paper, 
Icelandic Parsed Historical Corpus or IcePaHC (Wallen-
berg et al., 2011) is the product of three different projects 
which  originally  had  different  aims.  The  earliest  and 
largest of these projects was a subpart of a large language 
technology project which had the aim of developing three 
different basic language resources for Icelandic. The aim 
of  this  subproject  was  to  build  a  treebank  of  Modern 
Icelandic for use in language technology and to develop 
efficient  parsing  methods  and  tools  for  less  resourced 
languages.  Since  some  of  the  participants  had  been  in-
volved  in  historical  syntax  research,  we  also  wanted  to 
include  a  few  texts  from  older  stages  of  the  language. 
However, the main emphasis was on language technology 
use  –  we  intended  to  use  the  texts  to  train  a  statistical 
parser for Modern Icelandic. 
At the same time, two other projects with the aim of de-
veloping  resources  for  studying  diachronic  Icelandic 
syntax  were  in  preparation.  After  some  discussion,  the 
participants in these three projects decided to join forces 
and make a combined effort to build a large parsed corpus 
covering the history of Icelandic syntax from the earliest 
sources up to the present. This corpus thus serves the dual 
purpose  of  being  one  of  the  cornerstones  of  Icelandic 
language technology and being an invaluable tool in Ice-
landic diachronic syntax research. 
The  corpus  is  now  finished  and  contains  one  million 
words. It has been made available through free download 
(http://linguist.is/icelandic_treebank/Download) – in fact, 
we  released  preliminary  versions  every  three  months 
through the whole project period. We believe the corpus is 
unusual in many ways. 
First, it is designed from the beginning to serve both as a 
language  technology  tool  and  a  syntactic  research  tool, 
and developed by people with research experience in both 
diachronic  syntax  and  computational  linguistics.  Most 
parsed  corpora  are  developed  either  for  language  tech-

nology  use  (such  as  the  Penn  Treebank,  http://www. 
cis.upenn.edu/~treebank/) or for syntactic research (such 
as the Penn Parsed Corpora of Historical English, PPCHE, 
http://www.ling.upenn.edu/hist-corpora/;  Kroch 
and 
Taylor, 2000; Kroch, Santorini and Delfs, 2004). 
Secondly,  the  corpus  spans  almost  ten  centuries  –  the 
oldest  texts  are  written  in  the  final  decades  of  the  12th 
century and the youngest are from the first decade of the 
21st  century.  As  far  as  we  know,  no  other  single  parsed 
corpus  comes  close  to  that.  Most  other  languages  have 
changed so much in the course of the last thousand years 
that it would be more challenging to apply the same an-
notation scheme for the whole period. 
Third, our corpus contains over one million words and is 
thus  among  the  largest  parsed  corpora  that  have  been 
published  for  any  language.  As  far  as  we  know,  only 
English and Czech have larger hand-checked treebanks. 
Fourth,  the  corpus  is  completely  free  and  open  without 
any registration or paperwork, and the same goes for all 
the software that has been used to build it and the software 
that was developed within the project. Both the software 
and  the  corpus  itself  are  distributed  under  the  LGPL  li-
cense. 

This paper describes the background of the treebank. In 
the next section, we explain how it is possible and why it 
is feasible to build a diachronic treebank spanning almost 
ten  centuries  in  the  history  of  Icelandic.  After  that,  we 
discuss several aspects of the  material in the  treebank – 
the selection of the texts, their quality, and their conver-
sion to modern Icelandic spelling. We then go on to ex-
plain  why  we  choose  to  build  a  Penn  style  treebank  in-
stead  of  a  dependency  treebank,  which  might  perhaps 
seem a more obvious choice. Following a short descrip-
tion  of  the  annotation  process,  we  briefly  describe  a 
spin-off  project:  a  parsed  historical  corpus  of  Faroese, 
FarPaHC, which is only in its beginning stages. Finally, 
we present our open source policy and set forth “10 basic 
types of user freedom” for language resources.

2.  The diachronic dimension 
Icelandic is a language with a rich literary heritage rang-
ing from the 12th century to the present. It is a commonly 
accepted  fact  that  Icelandic  morphosyntax  has  changed 
much less during the last thousand years than most other 
European languages. This has often been attributed to the 
strong  literary  tradition  and  the  isolation  of  the  country. 
However, it must be emphasized that some features of the 
language  have  in  fact  changed  considerably  since  Old 
Icelandic. Thus, the phonological system has undergone 
dramatic  changes,  especially  the  vowel  system.  The 
phonetic quality of many of the vowels has changed, and 
the quantity system has changed such that vowel length is 
now context-dependent instead of being fixed. 
On the other  hand, the  inflectional system and the  mor-
phology has in all relevant respects remained unchanged 
from the earliest texts up to the present, although a num-
ber of nouns have shifted inflectional class, a few strong 
verbs have become weak, one inflectional class of nouns 
has  been  lost,  and  the  dual  in  personal  and  possessive 
pronoun has disappeared. The syntax is also basically the 
same, although a number of changes have occurred. The 
changes mainly involve word order, especially within the 
verb  phrase,  and  the  development  of  new  modal  con-
structions (cf. for instance Rögnvaldsson and Helgadóttir, 
2011). 
Thus,  present-day  Icelanders  can  read  many  texts  from 
the  13th  century  without  special  training,  although  that 
doesn’t  necessarily  mean  that  they  can  read  the  texts 
directly  from  the  manuscripts.  There  was  no  accepted 
spelling  standard  until  the  20th  century,  and  the  same 
sounds, sound combinations and words can be written in 
many ways. However, since the morphology is the same, 
it  is  usually  relatively  straightforward  to  convert  older 
spelling to the modern standard and get legible text. 
These two features – the stability of the morphology and 
the changes in the syntax – are the reasons why it is both 
possible  and  feasible  to  build  one  treebank  with  texts 
spanning a period of ten centuries. If the  morphological 
system  had  changed  dramatically,  it  would  have  been 
difficult to apply the same annotation scheme to old and 
modern  texts.  On  the  other  hand,  the  known  syntactic 
changes  and  variation  do  not  greatly  complicate  the  an-
notation  scheme,  making  it  feasible  to  build  a  tool  that 
enables us to study these changes and variation in a sys-
tematic way. The parsed historical corpus is such a tool. 

3.  Texts 

3.1  Text selection 
Selecting texts to parse for the corpus was a challenging 
task. We wanted to have the corpus both representative of 
different text genres and comparable through the centuries. 
This  meant  that  we  excluded  some  genres  which  have 
emerged only recently, such as newspaper texts. We de-
cided  in  the  beginning  on  a  goal  of  parsing  one  million 
words  –  approximately  100,000  from  each  century  of 
Icelandic literary tradition. 
Our original plan was to have samples from five different 

genres of text for each century – preferably 20,000 words 
from each text. The genres we had in mind were narrative 
texts, religious texts, biographies, laws, and science. We 
knew  from the beginning that it would be impossible to 
reach this goal, simply because texts belonging to some of 
the genres do not exist from all 10 centuries. We started 
with  narrative texts and religious texts, since texts  from 
these two genres were easiest to get hold of. 
When  we  were  well  into  the  project,  we  decided  to 
abandon  the  original  plan  and  concentrate  on  these  two 
genres. Narrative texts are the overwhelming majority of 
preserved  medieval  texts,  and  those  which  have  been 
most  studied  and  are  easiest  to  get.  It  is  also  relatively 
easy  to  find  religious  texts  from  most  centuries,  but  bi-
ographies, laws, and scientific texts are much fewer and 
harder to find in edited editions. Thus, we decided to stick 
to the original plan of having around 100,000 words from 
each  century,  but  instead  of  dividing  this  evenly  among 
five genres, we aimed at having 80,000 words of narrative 
texts  and  20,000  words  of  religious  prose.  This  also  in-
creases the data set for the two genres, allowing for more 
reliable studies of style-shifting phenomena. 
By  and  large,  this  plan  could  be  upheld.  However,  we 
didn’t  manage  to  find  any  religious  text  that  could  be 
attributed to the 15th century, and it proved to be difficult 
to find enough narrative texts from the 16th through 18th 
centuries.  Instead,  we  included  more  of  religious  texts 
from the 16th century and some biographies from the 18th 
and  19th  centuries.  The  distribution  of  the  texts  across 
genres and centuries is shown in table 1.

Table 1: Text types 

 
The corpus contains (samples of) 60 different texts which 
came from various sources. Approximately 20 texts were 
taken from text repositories on the Internet, especially the 
Icelandic Netútgáfan (http://snerpa.is/net) but a few came 
from  the  Project  Gutenberg  website  (http://www.  guten-
berg.org), the Internet Archive (http://www.archive.org/) 
and  the  Medieval  Nordic  Text  Archive  (http://www. 
menota.org/).  Around  10  texts  came  from  the  Árni 
Magnússon  Institute  text  archive  (http://www.lexis.hi.is/ 
corpus/).  We  received  around  10  texts  directly  from 
scholars  who  have  been  editing  them  or  publishing 
companies that had published them. The remaining texts,

around 20, were keyed in for us by students working on 
the project. Four texts from the 20th and 21st centuries are 
still  under  copyright,  but  we  contacted  the  authors  who 
gave us permission to use them. 

3.2  Text quality 
The  quality  of  the  texts  varies  a  lot.  Very  few  Old  Ice-
landic texts are preserved in the original, and exact dating 
of the texts is often very difficult. Usually, the preserved 
manuscripts are assumed to be several decades and even 
centuries younger than the original text. We know that the 
scribes  did  not  copy  the  manuscripts  letter  for  letter  – 
often they just used their own spelling instead of retaining 
the spelling of the original. This makes it very difficult to 
use the text to study phonology and morphology (cf. for 
instance Bernharðsson, 1999). 
For those who use the text to study syntax and syntactic 
change, however, this is not a serious drawback, although 
in exceptional cases case distinctions in endings may be 
lost  due  to  phonological  changes  and/or  changes  in 
spelling.  On  the  other  hand,  it  is  usually  assumed  that 
scribes  more  or  less  retained  the  word  order  and  other 
syntactic  features  of  the  manuscript  they  were  copying, 
although there are a number of known exceptions to this. 
The  treebank  is  accompanied  by  detailed  “info”  files 
which users can consult and make their own decisions on 
using or disregarding data from certain texts.  

3.3 Text conversion 
We decided to convert all our texts to  modern Icelandic 
spelling.  There  were  two  reasons  for  this.  One  was  that 
this  makes  it  possible  to  search  for  individual  words 
without  having  to  capture  all  possible  spelling  variants 
using fuzzy search, regular expressions and the like. The 
main  reason  was,  however,  that  we  wanted  to  use  the 
open-source  IceNLP  package  for  preprocessing.  This 
package  (available  at  http://icenlp.sourceforge.net)  con-
tains a tokenizer, a PoS tagger, a lemmatizer, and a shal-
low parser (Loftsson, 2008; Loftsson and Rögnvaldsson, 
2007;  Ingason  et  al.,  2008).  It  was  written  for  Modern 
Icelandic texts and its dictionary assumes that words have 
Modern Icelandic spelling. If  we had given the package 
input in the original spelling of each text, the result of the 
preprocessing would have been much poorer. 
All major texts from the medieval period have been pub-
lished, although the editions are not always as good as one 
would wish. Many texts from the 16th up to the 19th cen-
tury, however, have never been published. We decided in 
the beginning that we would only use texts from printed 
sources  –  it  would  have  been  prohibitively  time-  con-
suming and expensive to digitize texts from manuscripts. 
Editions  of  medieval  Icelandic  texts  have  one  of  three 
formats: 1) Diplomatic editions, where the text is printed 
exactly as in the manuscripts. 2) Standardized Old Norse 
spelling, which is a standard developed in the 19th century 
and is meant to mirror the sound system of 13th century 
Icelandic. 3) Modern Icelandic spelling. For most of the 
20th  century,  editions  of  medieval  texts  intended  for  the 
public were usually in the standardized Old Norse spell-

ing. Since the 1970s, however, it has become customary 
to use modern Icelandic spelling in new editions of me-
dieval  texts,  even  though  editions  mainly  aimed  at 
scholars  usually  try  to  mirror  the  spelling  of  the  manu-
script as closely as possible. Texts from the 19th century 
onwards  usually  only  have  minor  deviations  from  the 
modern spelling.  
A number of texts were in modern Icelandic spelling and 
could  be  used  as  they  were.  However,  the  majority  of 
them  were  either  in  standardized  Old  Norse  spelling  or 
diplomatic, and thus had to be changed. For the texts in 
the standardized Old Norse spelling, the task was rather 
easy, and a few simple scripts could be used to make most 
of the changes. The diplomatic editions were much harder. 
Some  scripts  and  simple  search-and-replace  could  help, 
but  since  the  spelling  in  these  texts  is  often  highly  ir-
regular, we had to go over them word by word and correct 
them, which was rather tedious and time-consuming.  

4.  Annotation 

4.1  Annotation scheme 
One  of  the  main  questions  which  had  to  be  answered 
before  the  annotation  started  was  which  annotation 
scheme to use. Most of the treebanks that have been built 
for the Scandinavian languages use some  version of de-
pendency parsing (e.g. Kromann, 2003; Bick, 2003; Nivre, 
Nilsson and Hall, 2006), so in some sense it would have 
been most natural for us to follow them. However, we had 
close contacts with the treebank team at the University of 
Pennsylvania  from  the  early  stages  of  the  project,  so  it 
was  a  natural  choice  for  us  to  use  the  phrase  structure 
annotation  scheme  that  they  have  developed  for  their 
parsed  historical  corpora  (Kroch,  Santorini  and  Delfs, 
2004;  Kroch  and  Taylor,  2000;  Santorini,  2010).  Thus, 
IcePaHC uses the same general type of labeled bracketing 
as  the  Penn  Treebank  (with  dash-separated  lemmata 
added) as shown below: 
 

( (IP-MAT (NP-SBJ (PRO-N Hann-hann)) 
        (VBDI spurði-spyrja) 
        (CP-QUE (WADVP-1 (WADV hvernig-hvernig)) 
              (C 0) 
              (IP-SUB (ADVP *T*-1) 
                    (NP-SBJ(NPR-D Grími-grímur)) 
                    (VBDS liði-líða)))) 
(ID 1888.GRIMUR.NAR-FIC,.301)) 
 
This  proved  to  be  a  very  fortunate  decision.  The  Penn 
annotation  scheme  has  already  been  adapted  for  Old 
English  (Taylor  et  al,.  2003),  which  is  rather  similar  to 
Icelandic in many respects, both as regards the syntax and 
the  morphological  system.  Thus,  the  scheme  could  be 
applied to Icelandic with only slight modifications. Fur-
thermore, the Penn team has written extensive annotation 
guidelines  which  were  of  tremendous  help  in  our  work 
(Santorini,  2010).  We  were  careful  to  write  our  own 
guidelines  and  document  all  deviations  from  and  addi-
tions to the Penn guidelines. 

1979

The decision to model our annotation on the Penn anno-
tation system also meant that we could use the software 
that has been written especially to facilitate the annotation 
(CorpusDraw)  and  to  search  the  corpus  (CorpusSearch; 
Randall, 2005). An extra bonus is that it is now very easy 
to compare Icelandic and older stages of English. We can 
write search queries for English in CorpusSearch and by 
and  large  use  the  same  queries  for  Icelandic,  although 
minor  modifications  are  sometimes  necessary.  Further-
more,  Penn-style  treebanks  have  been  built  or  are  cur-
rently being built for a number of other languages, such as 
French  (Martineu  et  al.,  2010),  Portuguese  (Galves  and 
Britto, 2002), Early High German (Light, 2010), Classical 
Greek (Beck, 2011), Yiddish (Santorini, 1997/2008), and 
more.  This  development  means  that  cross-linguistic, 
comparative  diachronic  studies  can  be  carried  out  in  a 
controlled  and  reproducible  way  with  the  same  search 
queries across these datasets. 
Yet  another  reason  for  choosing  the  Penn  annotation 
system  was  that  it  is  relatively  rich,  compared  to  most 
dependency-based schemes. Thus, it should – in principle, 
at  least  –  be  possible  to  convert  our  treebank  to  a  de-
pendency  treebank,  although  some  information  will  be 
lost in the conversion. Going the other way, that is, con-
verting  a  dependency-based  treebank  to  a  Penn-style 
phrase  structure  treebank,  would,  on  the  other  hand,  be 
impossible without adding information. 
Even though we followed the Penn scheme in most cases, 
we found it necessary to make some slight modifications, 
as mentioned above. The most important of these are that 
we annotate the words for lemma and nominals also for 
case,  neither  of  which  is  done  in  the  English  historical 
corpora (excepting case in Old English). 

4.2  The annotation process 
After  the  texts  had  been  converted  to  modern  Icelandic 
spelling, they were handed over to student assistants who 
had the task of dividing them into clauses. Some periods 
do  not  signal  the  end  of  a  tree  and  not  all  trees  end  in 
periods.  Sentence  boundary  detection  for  English  has 
been  shown  to  classify  periods  such  that  98.5%  of  sen-
tences boundaries are correctly identified, a considerable 
improvement over the 90% precision of a baseline clas-
sifier  which  assumes  every  period  to  be  a  boundary 
(Palmer  and  Hearst,  1994).  While  this  may  seem  en-
couraging  we  have  two  good  reasons  for  preferring  a 
manual approach to clause boundary detection. 
First,  while  rules  for  classifying  periods  as  boundary 
marking  or  not  are  fairly  simple,  the  rules  for  inserting 
clause  boundaries  (usually  between  well-formed  matrix 
clauses  but  sometimes  sentence  fragments  without 
enough  material  to  reconstruct  clausal  structure  reliably 
and  consistently)  are  more  complicated  and  require  in-
terpretation  of  gapping  structures  where  the  nature  and 
amount of omitted material affects the boundary status of 
conjunctive elements. Such problems can in principle be 
addressed using computational methods but the required 
tools  are  not  currently  available  for  Icelandic  and  their 
development was beyond the scope of our project. 

Second,  while  clause  boundary  detection  is  not  a  trivial 
computational task it is fairly simple for a human and this 
part of the annotation could be carried out fast and reliably 
by research assistants which did not have to be trained in 
the complexities of full phrase structure annotation. 
After running IceNLP we ran a few programs developed 
within the project to prepare the text for manual annota-
tion.  The  PoS  tagset  was  converted  to  a  format  nearly 
identical to the Penn Parsed Corpora of Historical English, 
the format of the labeled bracketing was converted to the 
Penn  treebank  format  for  compatibility  with  existing 
software  and  various  structures  were  partially  annotated 
using  CorpusSearch  revision  queries  (Randall,  2005). 
Such partial annotation includes building the left edge of 
subordinate  clauses  whose  right  edge  is  subsequently 
determined by a human annotator.  
The manual annotation phase comprised the bulk of the 
work. In the beginning, we used the CorpusDraw software 
to correct the parse, but we soon realized that it would be 
possible to speed up the annotation if we had software that 
was  better  suited  for  the  task.  Therefore,  we  wrote  the 
annotation tool Annotald which made it possible to speed 
up  the  annotation  considerably.  Annotald  is  a  browser 
based  cross-platform  visual  tree  editor  which  combines 
keyboard and mouse shortcuts such that the annotator can 
always keep the left hand on the keyboard and the right 
hand  on  the  mouse.  This  avoids  moving  the  right  hand 
back and forth between mouse and keyboard which leads 
to  improved  speed  and  accuracy  over  CorpusDraw  (see 
Figure 1 for the overall impact of improved methods and 
training  on  tree  production).  Annotald  is  released  under 
the  GPL  license  and  continues  to  be  developed  by  a 
growing  team  of  programmers  at  the  University  of 
Pennsylvania (Beck, Ecay and Ingason, 2011). 
 

 

Figure 1: The annotation process 

 
Three annotators worked on the project. In the beginning, 
they reviewed each other’s work and spent a lot of time 
consulting the annotation manual for the Penn Historical 
Corpora (Santorini, 2010), which we succeeded in adapt-
ing  to  Icelandic.  When  the  annotators  had  become  well 
acquainted  with  the  annotation  scheme  and  developed 
special  annotation  rules  for  most  of  the  cases  where 
Icelandic  deviates  from  Old(er)  English,  they  stopped 
reviewing  each  other’s  annotations  and  placed  the  em-

1980

phasis on speeding up the annotation as much as possible. 
Figure  1  shows  the  annotation  progress  for  the  whole 
project period. 
We are in no doubt that the speed of the annotation proc-
ess, and the fact that a large part of the annotation has not 
been reviewed, has resulted in a considerable number of 
annotation  errors  and  discrepancies.  The  errors  are  nev-
ertheless a small minority of potential errors. Our current 
approach to correction is to systematically enforce more 
constraints  on  well-formed  structures.  For  example,  the 
latest  release  of  the  corpus  (Wallenberg  et  al.  2011)  in-
correctly contains 51 clauses with two phrases labeled as 
direct  objects  (NP-OB1).  This  is  about  1%  of  the  4727 
double  object  clauses  in  the  corpus  and  in  most  of  the 
cases one of the two objects should be labeled as an in-
direct object (NP-OB2). 
These errors and many more have been corrected for the 
next release of the corpus. However, we want to empha-
size that the corpus is  meant  to be used  for quantitative 
research,  not  qualitative.  It  is  not  possible  to  take  the 
parsing of any single sentence from the corpus and rely on 
it  without  reflection.  The  reasons  are  both  that  the  text 
may  be  of  disputable  age  and  the  parse  may  contain  an 
error.  However,  we  believe  that  the  quantity  of  the  text 
and  its  overall  quality  make  the  corpus  safe  to  use  in 
quantitative studies and the quality will only improve as 
future users notify us of errors they catch in their work. 

5.  A Spin-off: FarPaHC 

5.1  Background 
Since  we  believe  the  model  we  used  in  the  building  of 
IcePaHC was highly successful, we wanted to extend this 
model  to  a  related  less-resourced  language  and  build  a 
Faroese  Parsed  Historical  Corpus,  FarPaHC.  Faroese  is 
spoken by 48,000 people in the Faroe Islands, 25,000 in 
Denmark and 5,000 people in Iceland (http://fo.wikipedia. 
org/wiki/Føroyskt_mál). The closest relative of Faroese is 
Icelandic and the two languages share a number of prop-
erties.  Both  languages  have  rich  case  morphology  (four 
cases) and nominals and adjectives also inflect for number 
and gender. A native speaker of Icelandic can read written 
Faroese (and vice versa), though the spoken languages are 
just  different  enough  to  not  be  mutually  intelligible 
without considerable effort. 
Our  goal  is  to  build  a  250,000  word  fully  parsed,  PoS 
tagged  and  lemmatized  corpus  of  19th-21st  century 
Faroese. The reason why we do not have older texts is that 
Faroese literary tradition is so short. Since IcePaHC con-
sists mostly of religious texts and narratives, we focus on 
balancing FarPaHC for the same genres, which will help 
to  control  for  social  and  stylistic  factors  when  syntactic 
change  and  stability  in  Icelandic  and  Faroese  are  com-
pared.  This  means  that  most  texts  in  the  treebank  date 
from the 19th century to the present. In IcePaHC, around 
100,000  words  were  parsed  for  each  century  with  the 
exception  that  there  is  only  a  little  more  than  40,000 
words from the 12th and the 21st century each. In light of 
this,  our  aim  for  FarPaHC  is  to  parse  200,000  words  in 

total from texts dating from the 19th and 20th century and 
50,000 words from the 21st century. The main reason for 
our modest goal of 250,000 words is that there is only one 
annotator working on the project. 
Our  method  of  text  selection  within  these  genres  is  pri-
marily  in  order  to  facilitate  cross-linguistic  comparison, 
especially  with  Icelandic,  English,  and  other  Germanic 
languages,  but  it  is  also  partly  opportunistic.  We  try  to 
find texts that are already digitized because it costs money 
and  time  to  key  them  in  (and  even  more  to  transcribe 
manuscripts).  We  also  focus  on  parsing  texts  that  are 
parallel  translations  of  texts  found  in  IcePaHC  and 
PPCHE,  such  as  the  Gospel  of  John  and  Acts  of  the 
Apostles from the New Testament. We are also going to 
parse at least one Faroese version of a narrative found in 
IcePaHC. Such a text could be one of the Icelandic family 
sagas, for instance The Saga of Grettir the Strong (Grettis 
saga). The size of the samples from each text is intended 
to  be  similar  to  those  in  PPCHE  and  IcePaHC,  roughly 
20,000 words (when possible).

the 

5.2  Annotation 
When we started building FarPaHC we used the modified 
PPCHE scheme from IcePaHC. As pointed out above, this 
allows for easy crosslinguistic comparison, as well as for 
experimentation  in  developing  multilingual  taggers  and 
parsers. For more consistent parse we document our de-
cisions (http://linguist.is/farpahc/) and where possible, we 
follow 
PPCHE 
guidelines  written 
(http://www.ling.upenn.edu/hist-corpora/)  and  the  Ice-
PaHC  documentation  (http://linguist.is/icelandic_tree- 
bank/).  This  is  also  helpful  for  users  of  the  treebank. 
Morphologically  and  syntactically,  Faroese  resembles 
Icelandic in many ways. This makes it more important to 
follow the guidelines for IcePaHC and saves a lot of time 
because this decreases the number of decisions that need 
to be taken in the annotation process. 
Since the annotator in the FarPaHC project has experience 
from IcePaHC we do not have to spend time and money 
on training. If one can read Icelandic it is  fairly easy to 
read Faroese as well so the language does not either slow 
us down. However, for semi-automatic parsing we are not 
able  to  use  parsers,  morphological  taggers  and  lemma-
tizers  written  for  Faroese  –  we  must  rely  on  programs 
written  for  Icelandic,  especially  the  IceNLP  package 
which  was  used  in  the  IcePaHC  annotation.  This  de-
creases the parsing speed in the beginning of the project. 
Nevertheless,  we  use IceNLP in our annotation process, 
even though the tagger and lemmatizer produce a number 
of errors that they would not on Icelandic data. To correct 
this effect as efficiently as possible, we specify a number 
of  handwritten  rules  as  we  go  along  which  slows  the 
process down at  first.  We focus on  writing rules  for the 
most common words, e.g., pronouns, quantifiers, auxilia-
ries (HAVE and BE), modal verbs and function words, such 
as complementizers and prepositions. 
When we have run IceNLP on the raw data, we take the 
output and manually parse it with Annotald (Beck, Ecay 
and  Ingason,  2011;  cf.  above).  The  following  is  a  fully 

1981

parsed  (and  handcorrected)  token  in  FarPaHC  (the  sen-
tence  is  from  the  Gospel  of  John).  For  convenience  we 
leave out the glosses.

Since  FarPaHC  is  compatible  with,  e.g.,  IcePaHC  and 
PPCHE the same, or very similar, queries can be used. To 
demonstrate  this  we  show  the  same  sentence  from  the 
Gospel of John as above in IcePaHC and the Penn Parsed 
Corpus  of  Early  Modern  English  (Kroch,  Santorini  and 
Delfs, 2004), respectively.

We plan to publish the first version, 0.1, on June 1st. Every 
four months after that we plan to release a new version, 
with  more  words,  until  we  achieve  our  goal  of  250,000 
words. Even though the first release of the corpus will be 
rather  small,  probably  around  50,000  words,  it  can  be 
useful to have this resource in comparative syntactic re-
search,  especially  since  the  first  texts  that  we  parse,  the 
Gospel of John and the Acts of the Apostles, are found in 
other Penn style treebanks, such as IcePaHC and PPCHE. 
People who prefer dependency treebanks should be able 
to use it by converting our parse to a dependency parse. 
The first release will  nevertheless probably be too small 
for computational linguists to train data-driven tools. 

6.  Maximizing distribution 
and user freedom 
We believe strongly in the sharing of resources. True to 
that spirit, we decided at the beginning of the project that 
we wanted to make our work as open and widely distrib-
uted  as  possible.  To  emphasize  that,  we  defined  the 
following “10 basic types of user freedom”: 
 
1.  Raw data available can be downloaded for local use 

(corpus not hidden behind a search interface) 

2.  Comprehensive  documentation 

freely  available 

online 

3.  Available  without  registration,  user  identification  of 

some sort, or signing of contracts 

4.  Development  process  of  corpus  relies  only  on 
free/open source software tools (for transparent rep-
lication of annotation process) 

5.  Open  development  (annotation  is  carried  out  in  an 
open  online  version  control  repository  for  transpar-
ency  regarding  the  actual  steps  taken  in  the  devel-
opment and immediate access to work-in-progress) 
6.  Regular  scheduled  releases  of  numbered  versions 
during  development  as  well  as  for  more  permanent 
milestone  versions  so  that  researchers  can  always 
produce replicable results on a recent version of the 
corpus 

7.  Users  can  improve  the  corpus  and  release  modified 

versions without special permission 

8.  Free of cost to academia 
9.  Free of cost to commercial users 
10. Corpus released under a standard free license of some 
sort for straightforward compatibility with other pro-
jects (GPL, LGPL, CC, etc.) 

 
We decided not to wait until the treebank was finished to 
release it. Instead, we released a new version every three 
months, in the hope of incrementally building up a user 
base and getting feedback from users which we could use 
to  improve  the  treebank.  This  worked  very  well  –  for 
instance,  Version  0.4,  released  in  April  2011  and  con-
taining  around  440,000  words,  was  downloaded  (in  dif-
ferent  formats)  more  than  450  times  from  the  project 
website  (http://linguist.is/icelandic_treebank/Download). 
Furthermore,  the  treebank  had  already  been  used  in  a 
number of studies before the current version was released 
in August 2011 (e.g. Sapp, 2011; Ingason, Sigurðsson and 
Wallenberg, 2011; Light and Wallenberg, 2011). 
As  pointed  out  by  Muhonen  and  Purtonen  (2011),  it  is 
more difficult to gather information about the number of 
users of free treebanks than treebanks which require user 
registration, but we believe the benefits of user freedom 
outweigh such minor problems and in the course of time 
the impact of the treebank will be measured by its usage in 
published works rather than by raw download counts. 
We  follow  the  principles  listed  above  strictly  in  the  on-
going FarPaHC project. That involves regular scheduled 
releases before we reach our goal of 250,000 words. Re-
garding the  fifth pointer above (open development), our 
open online version control repository is found on github. 
The URL is https://github.com/antonkarl/icecorpus. 
Even though IcePaHC is practically finished, the current 
version is numbered 0.9 because some minor corrections 
remain to be made. The treebank is released in three ver-
sions;  a  zip-file  containing  the  raw  data  of  the  of  the 
corpus in labeled bracketing format; an easy-to-use setup 
executable  for  Windows  that  installs  the  corpus  and  a 
graphical  user  interface;  and  a  zip-file  containing  the 
corpus and a platform independent user interface in Java. 
The  treebank  has  also  been  uploaded  to  the  INESS  re-
pository at the University of Bergen (http://iness.uib.no) 
where it may be viewed and searched.

language resources under an open source license. This is 
especially  important  when  working  on  less-resourced 
languages  where  duplication  of  work  must  be  avoided. 
We  hope  that  other  researchers  will  follow  in  our  steps 
and make their resources and tools publicly available for 
the benefit of all.

7.  Conclusion 
In  this  paper,  we  have  described  the  parsed  historical 
corpus  of  Icelandic,  IcePaHC,  and  its  motivations.  As 
pointed  out  in  the  introduction,  the  corpus  was  built  in 
order to serve two purposes: first, to be used within lan-
guage technology to train parsers etc., and secondly, to be 
used as a tool for diachronic syntactic research.  
Its  usefulness  for  the  latter  purpose  has  already  been 
demonstrated.  For  instance,  four  papers  that  were  pre-
sented at the 13th Diachronic Generative Syntax Confer-
ence  (DiGS)  in  June  2011  made  use  of  the  corpus  (see 
http://www.ling.upenn.edu/Events/DIGS13/).  As  for  the 
first purpose, the corpus has not yet been put to use but 
there is no reason to doubt that it can serve that purpose 
too. The corpus contains around 300,000 words which can 
safely  be  considered  Modern  Icelandic  –  texts  from  the 
19th,  20th  and  21st  centuries.  That  is  more  than  enough 
material to train a statistical parser. The project has also 
created a spin-off in the Faroese parsed historical corpus, 
FarPaHC. 
As mentioned above, we believe that IcePaHC is unusual 
for a number of reasons. The most important one is that 
we  have  brought  together  a  group  of  researchers  who 
come from different fields and have different motives, but 
saw  the  benefits  of  joining  their  forces  in  building  an 
important language resource which serves a dual purpose. 
The interdisciplinarity of the team should ensure that both 
humanist  researchers  and  language  technologists  feel  at 
ease in using the corpus in their work. 
Finally,  we  emphasize  the  importance  of  distributing
