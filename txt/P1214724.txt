ABSTRACT
Literature search is critical for any scientific research. Different
from Web or general domain search, a large portion of queries in
scientific literature search are entity-set queries, that is, multiple
entities of possibly different types. Entity-set queries reflect user’s
need for finding documents that contain multiple entities and reveal
inter-entity relationships and thus pose non-trivial challenges to
existing search algorithms that model each entity separately. How-
ever, entity-set queries are usually sparse (i.e., not so repetitive),
which makes ineffective many supervised ranking models that rely
heavily on associated click history. To address these challenges, we
introduce SetRank, an unsupervised ranking framework that mod-
els inter-entity relationships and captures entity type information.
Furthermore, we develop a novel unsupervised model selection
algorithm, based on the technique of weighted rank aggregation,
to automatically choose the parameter settings in SetRank without
resorting to a labeled validation set. We evaluate our proposed un-
supervised approach using datasets from TREC Genomics Tracks
and Semantic Scholar’s query log. The experiments demonstrate
that SetRank significantly outperforms the baseline unsupervised
models, especially on entity-set queries, and our model selection
algorithm effectively chooses suitable parameter settings.

1 INTRODUCTION
Literature search helps a researcher identify relevant papers and
summarize essential claims about a topic, forming a critical step
in any scientific research. With the fast-growing volume of scien-
tific publications, a good literature search engine is essential to
researchers, especially in the domains like computer science and
biomedical science where the literature collections are so massive,
diverse, and rapidly evolving—few people can master the state-of-
the-art comprehensively and in depth.

A large set of literature search queries contain multiple entities
which can be either concrete instances (e.g., GABP (a gene)) or ab-
stract concepts (e.g., clustering). We refer these queries as entity-set

queries. For example, a computer scientist may want to find out
how knowledge base can be used for document retrieval and thus
issues a query “knowledge base for document retrieval”, which is
an entity-set query containing two entities. Similarly, a biologist
may want to survey how genes GABP, TERT, and CD11b are associ-
ated with cancer and submits a query “GABP TERT CD11b cancer”,
another entity-set query with one disease and three gene entities.
Compared with typical short keyword queries, a distinctive char-
acteristic of entity-set queries is that they reflect user’s need for
finding documents containing inter-entity relations. For example,
among 50 queries collected from biologists in 2005 as part of TREC
Genomics Track [15], 40 of them are explicitly formulated as find-
ing relations among at least two entities. In most cases, a user who
submits an entity-set query will expect to get a ranked list of docu-
ments that are most relevant to the whole entity set. Therefore, as
in the previous examples, returning a paper about only knowledge
bases or only one gene GABP is unsatisfactory.

Entity-set queries pose non-trivial challenges to existing search
platforms. For example, among the 100 queries1 released by Se-
mantic Scholar (S2), 40 of them are entity-set queries and S2’s
production ranking system performs poorly on these entity-set
queries, as shown in Table 1. The difficulties of handling entity-set
queries mainly come from two aspects. First, entity relations within
entity sets have not been modeled effectively. The association or co-
occurrence of multiple entities has not gained adequate attention
from existing ranking models. As a result, those models will rank
papers where a single distinct entity appears multiple times higher
than those containing many distinct entities. Second, entity-set
queries are particularly challenging for supervised ranking models.
As manual labeling of document relevance in academic search re-
quires domain expertise, it is too expensive to train a ranking model
based purely on manually labeling. Most systems will first apply
an off-the-shelf unsupervised ranking model during their cold-start
process and then collect user interaction data (e.g., click informa-
tion). Unfortunately, entity-set queries are usually sparse (i.e., not so
repetitive), and have less associated click information. Furthermore,
many off-the-shelf unsupervised models cannot return reasonably
good candidate documents for entity-set queries within the top-20

positions. Many highly relevant documents will not be presented
to users, which further compromises the usefulness of clicking
information.

This paper tackles the new challenge—improving the search qual-
ity of scientific literature on entity-set queries and proposes an unsu-
pervised ranking approach. We introduce SetRank, an unsupervised
ranking framework that explicitly models inter-entity relations and
captures entity type information. SetRank first links entity men-
tions in query and documents to an external knowledge-base. Then,
each document is represented with both bag-of-words and bag-
of-entities representations [37, 38] and fits two language models
respectively. On the query side, a novel heterogeneous graph rep-
resentation is proposed to model complex entity information (e.g.,
entity type) and entity relations within the set. This heterogeneous
query graph represents all the information need in that query. Fi-
nally, the query-document matching is defined as a graph covering
process and each document is ranked based on the information need
it covers in the query graph.

Although being an unsupervised ranking framework, SetRank still
has some parameters that need to be appropriately learned using
a labeled validation set. To further automate the process of rank-
ing model development, we develop a novel unsupervised model
selection algorithm based on the technique of weighted rank ag-
gregation. Given a set of queries with no labeled documents, and a
set of candidate parameter settings, this algorithm automatically
learns the most suitable parameter settings for that set of queries.
The significance of our proposed unsupervised ranking approach
is two-fold. First, SetRank itself, as an unsupervised ranking model,
boosts the literature search performance on entity-set queries. Sec-
ond, SetRank can be adopted during the cold-start process of a
search system, which enables the collection of high-quality click
data for training subsequent supervised ranking model. Our experi-
ments on S2’s benchmark datasets and TREC 2004 & 2005 Genomics
Tracks [14, 15] demonstrate the usefulness of our unsupervised
model selection algorithm and the effectiveness of SetRank for
searching scientific literature, especially on entity-set queries.
In summary, this work makes the following contributions:

(1) A new research problem, effective entity-set search of scientific

literature, is studied.

(2) SetRank, an unsupervised ranking framework, is proposed,
which models inter-entity relations and captures entity type
information.

(3) A novel unsupervised model selection algorithm is developed,
which automatically selects SetRank’s parameter settings with-
out resorting to a labeled validation set.

(4) Extensive experiments are conducted in two scientific domains,
demonstrating the effectiveness of SetRank and our unsuper-
vised model selection algorithm.

The remaining of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2
discusses related work. Section 3 presents our ranking framework
SetRank. Section 4 presents the unsupervised model selection al-
gorithm. Section 5 reports and analyzes the experimental results
on two benchmark datasets and shows a case study of SetRank for
biomedical literature search. Finally, Section 6 concludes this work
with discussions on some future directions.

2 RELATED WORK
We examine related work in three aspects: academic search, entity-
aware ranking model, and automatic ranking model selection.

2.1 Academic Search
The practical importance of finding highly relevant papers in scien-
tific literature has motivated the development of many academic
search systems. Google Scholar is arguably the most widely used
system due to its large coverage. However, the ranking result of
Google Scholar is still far from satisfactory because of its bias to-
ward highly cited papers [1]. As a result, researchers may choose
other academic search platforms, such as CiteSeerX [34], AMiner
[31], PubMed [21], Microsoft Academic Search [30] and Semantic
Scholar [39]. Research efforts of many such systems focus on the
analytical tasks of scholar data such as author name disambiguation
[31], paper importance modeling [29], and entity-based distinctive
summarization [27]. However, this work focuses on ad-hoc docu-
ment retrieval and ranking in academic search. The most relevant
work to ours is [39] in which entity embeddings are used to obtain
“soft match” feature of each ⟨query, document⟩ pair. However, [39]
requires training data to combine word-based and entity-based
relevance scores and to select parameter settings, which is rather
different from our unsupervised approach.

2.2 Entity-aware Ranking Model
Entities, such as people, locations, or abstract concepts, are natu-
ral units for organizing and retrieving information [10]. Previous
studies found that over 70% of Bing’s query and more than 50%
of traffic in Semantic Scholar are related to entities [12, 39]. The
recent availability of large-scale knowledge repositories and accu-
rate entity linking tools have further motivated a growing body of
work on entity-aware ranking models. These models can be roughly
categorized into three classes: expansion-based, projection-based,
and representation-based.

The expansion-based methods use entity descriptions from knowl-
edge repositories to enhance query representation. Xu et al. [40]
use entity descriptions in Wikipedia as pseudo relevance feedback
corpus to obtain cleaner expansion terms; Xiong and Callen [36]
utilize the description of Freebase entities related to the query for
query expansion; Dalton et al. [7] expand a query using the text
fields of the attributes of the query-related entities and generate
richer learning-to-rank features based on the expanded texts.

The projection-based methods try to project both query and doc-
ument onto an entity space for comparison. Liu and Fang [20] use
entities from a query and its related documents to construct a latent
entity space and then connect the query and documents based on
the descriptions of the latent entities. Xiong and Callen [35] use the
textual features among query, entities, and documents to model the
query-entity and entity-document connections. These additional
connections between query and document are then utilized in a
learning-to-rank model. A fundamental difference of our work from
the above methods is that we do not represent query and document
using external terms/entities that they do not contain. This is to
avoid adding noisy expansion of terms/entities that may not reflect
the information need in the original user query.

Entity Set Search of Scientific Literature: An Unsupervised Ranking Approach

SIGIR ’18, July 8–12, 2018, Ann Arbor, MI, USA

The representation-based methods, as a recent trend for utiliz-
ing entity information, aim to build entity-enhanced text repre-
sentation and combine it with traditional word-based represen-
tation [38]. Xiong et al. [37] propose a bag-of-entities represen-
tation and demonstrated its effectiveness for vector space model.
Raviv et al. [26] leverage the surface names of entities to build
an entity-based language model. Many supervised ranking mod-
els are proposed to apply learning-to-rank methods for combining
entity-based signals with word-based signals. For example, ESR [39]
uses entity embeddings to compute entity-based query-document
matching score and then combines it with word-based score using
RankSVM. Following the same spirit, Xiong et al. [38] propose a
word-entity duet framework that simultaneously models the entity
annotation uncertainty and trains the ranking model. Comparing
with the above methods, we also use the bag-of-entity representa-
tion but combine it with word-based representation in an unsuper-
vised way. Also, to the best of our knowledge, we are the first to
capture entity relation and type information in an unsupervised
entity-aware ranking model.

2.3 Automatic Ranking Model Selection
Most ranking models need to manually set many parameter val-
ues. To automate the process of selecting parameter settings, some
AutoML methods [3, 8] are proposed. Nevertheless, these methods
still require a validation set which contains queries with labeled
documents. In this paper, we develop an unsupervised model selec-
tion algorithm, based on rank aggregation, to automatically choose
parameter settings without resorting to a labeled validation set.
Rank aggregation aims to combine multiple existing rankings into
a joint ranking. Fox and Shaw [9] propose some deterministic func-
tions to combine rankings heuristically. Klementiev et al. [18, 19]
propose an unsupervised learning algorithm for rank aggregation
based on a linear combination of ranking functions. Another re-
lated line of work is to model rankings using a statistical model
(e.g., Plackett-Luce model) and aggregate them based on statistical
inference [11, 22, 42]. Lately, Bhowmik and Ghosh [2] propose to
use object attributes to augment some standard rank aggregation
framework. Compared with these methods, our proposed algorithm
goes beyond just combining multiple rankings and uses aggregated
ranking to guide the selection of parameter settings.

3 RANKING FRAMEWORK
This section presents our unsupervised ranking framework for
leveraging entity (set) information in search. Our framework pro-
vides a principled way to rank a set of documents D for a query q. In
this framework, we represent each document using standard bag-of-
words and bag-of-entities representations [37, 38] (Section 3.1) and
represent the query using a novel heterogeneous graph (Section 3.2)
which naturally model the entity set information. Finally, we model
the query-document matching as a “graph covering" process, as
described in Section 3.3.

3.1 Document Representation
We represent each document using both word and entity infor-
mation. For words, we use standard bag-of-words representation
and treat each unigram as a word. For entities, we adopt an en-
tity linking tool (details described in Section 5.2) that utilizes a

prised of two fields (i.e., title, abstract) with their corresponding bag-
of-words and bag-of-entities representations.

knowledge base/graph (e.g., Wikidata or Freebase) where entities
have unique IDs. Given an input text, this tool will find the entity
mentions (i.e., entity surface names) in the text and link each of
them to a disambiguated entity in the knowledge base/graph. For
example, given the input document title “Training linear SVMs in
linear time”, this tool will link the entity mention “SVMs”’ to the
entity “Support Vector Machine” with Freebase id ‘/m/0hc2f’. Pre-
vious studies [26, 37] show that when the entity linking error is
within a reasonable range, the returned entity annotations, though
noisy, can still improve the overall search performance, partially
due to the following:
(1) Polysemy resolution. Different entities with the same surface
name will be resolved by the entity linker. For example, the fruit
“Apple” (with id ‘/m/014j1m’) will be disambiguated with the
company “Apple” (with id ‘/m/0k8z’).

(2) Synonymy resolution. Different entity surface names cor-
responding to the same entity will be identified and merged.
For example, the entity “United States of America” (with id
‘/m/09c7w0’) can have different surface names including “USA”,
“United States”, and “U.S.” [26]. The entity linker can map all
these surface names to the same entity.

After linking all the entity mentions in a document to entities
in the knowledge base, we can obtain the bag-of-entities represen-
tation of this document. Then, we fit two language models (LMs)
for this document: one being word-based (i.e., traditional unigram
LM) and the other being entity-based. Notice that in the literature
search scenario, documents (i.e., papers) usually contain multiple
fields, such as title, abstract, and full text. We model each document
field using a separate bag-of-words representation and a separate
bag-of-entities representation, as shown in Figure 1.

To exploit such intra-document structures, we generally assume
a document di has k fields di = {di,1, . . . , di,k } and thus the doc-
ument collection can be separated into k parts: {D1, . . . , Dk }. Fol-
lowing [24], we assign each field a weight δj and formulate the
generation process of a token t given the document di as follows:

p(t |di ) =

p(t |di, j )p(di, j |di ),

p(di, j |di ) =

k

Notice the a token t can be either a unigram w or an entity e, and the
field weight δj can be either manually set based on prior knowledge
or automatically learned using the mechanism described in Sec-
tion 4. The token generation probability under each document field
p(t |di, j ) can be obtained from the maximum likelihood estimate
with Dirichlet prior smoothing [41] as follows:

3.2 Query Representation
Given an input query q, we first apply the same entity linker used
for document representation to extract all the entity information
in the query. Then, we design a novel heterogeneous graph to
represent this query q, denoted as Gq . Such a graph representation
captures both word and entity information in the query and models
the entity relations. A concrete example is shown in Figure 2.
Node representation. In this heterogeneous query graph, each
node represents a query token. As a token can be either a word or
an entity, there are two different types of nodes in this graph.
Edge representation. We use an edge to represent a latent relation
between two query tokens. In this work, we consider two types
of latent relations: word-word relation and entity-entity relation.
For word-word relation, we add an edge for each pair of adjacent
word tokens with equal weight 1. For instance, given an query
“Atari video games”, we will add two edges, one between word pairs
⟨Atari, video⟩ and the other between ⟨video, game⟩. On the entity
side, we aim to emphasize all the possible entity-entity relations,
and thus add an edge between each pair of entity tokens.
Modeling entity type. The type information of each query entity
can further reveal the user’s information need. Therefore, we assign
the weight of each entity-entity relation based on these two entities’
type information. Intuitively, if the types of two entities are distant
from each other in a type hierarchy, then the relation between these
two entities should have a larger weight. A similar idea is exploited
in [10] and found useful for type-aware entity retrieval.

Mathematically, we use ϕe to denote the type of entity e; use
LCAu,v to denote the Lowest Common Ancestor (LCA) of two
nodes u and v in a given tree (i.e., type hierarchy), and use l(u, v)
to denote the length of a path between node u and node v. In
Figure 2, for example, the entity tokens ‘/m/0hjlw’ and ‘/m/0xwj’,
corresponding to “reinforcement learning” and “Atari”, have types
‘education.field_of_study’ and ‘computer.game’, respectively. The
Lowest Common Ancestor of these two types in the type hierarchy
is ‘Thing’. Finally, we define the relation strength between entity
e1 and entity e2 as follows:

LCAe1, e2
λe1, e2

= LCA(ϕe1, ϕe2 ),
= 1 + max (cid:8)l (ϕe1, LCAe1, e2 ), l (ϕe2, LCAe1, e2 )(cid:9) .

(4)

Our proposed heterogeneous query graph representation is general
and can be extended. For example, we can apply dependency parsing
for verbose queries, and only add an edge between two word tokens
that have direct dependency relation. Also, if the importance of each

graph representation of one query. Word-word relations are
marked by dash lines and entity-entity relations are marked by
solid lines. Different solid line colors represent different relation
strengths based on two entities’ types.

entity-entity relation is given, we can then set the edge weights
correspondingly. We leave these extensions for future works.

3.3 Document Ranking using Query Graph
Our proposed heterogeneous query graph Gq represents all infor-
mation need in the user-issued query. Such need can be either to
find document discussing one particular entity or to identify papers
studying an important inter-entity relation. Intuitively, a document
that can satisfy more information need should be ranked at a higher
position. To quantify such information need that is explained by a
document, we define the following graph covering process.
Query graph covering. If a query token t ∈ q exists in a document
di , we say di covers the node in Gq that corresponds to this token.
Similarly, if a pair of query tokens t1 and t2 exists in di , we say di
covers the edge in Gq that corresponds to the relation of this token
pair ⟨t1, t2⟩. The subgraph of Gq that is covered by the document
di , denoted as Gq |di
, represents the information need in the query
q that is explained by the document di .

Furthermore, we follow the same spirit of [23] and view the
as a Markov Network, based on which we define
subgraph Gq |di
the joint probability of the document di and the query q as follows:

1

Z

(5)

(cid:214)

f (c),

c ∈Gq |di

P (di, q) def=

log ψ (c) rank= (cid:213)
c ∈Gq |di

ψ (c) rank= (cid:213)
c ∈Gq |di
where Z is a normalization factor, c indexes the cliques in graph, and
ψ (c) is the non-negative potential defined on c. The last equation
holds as we let ψ (c) = exp[f (c)]. Notice that if Gq |d1
is a subgraph
of Gq |d2
which means document d1 covers less information than
document d2 does, we should have P(d1, q) < P(d2, q). Therefore,
we should design f (·) to satisfy the constraint f (c) > 0, ∀c.

In this work, we focus on modeling each single entity and pair-
wise relations between two entities. Therefore, each clique c can
be either a node or an edge in the graph. Modeling higher-order
relations among more than two entities (i.e., cliques with size larger
than 2) is left for future work. We define the potential functions for
a single node and an edge as follows:
Node potential. Node potential quantifies the information need
contained in a single node t, which can be either a word token w
or an entity token e. To balance the relative weight of a word token
and an entity token, we introduce a parameter λE ∈ [0, 1], and

define the node potential function f (·) as follows:

f (t ) =

(cid:26) λE · a(P (t |di ))

(1 − λE ) · a(P (t |di ))

if token t is an entity token
if token t is a word token

(6)

√

where a(·) is an activation function that transforms a raw probabil-
ity to a node potential. Here, we set a(x) =
x in order to amplify
P(t |di ) which has a relatively small value.
Edge potential. Edge potential quantifies the information need
contained in an edge ⟨t1, t2⟩ that can be either a word-word (W-W)
relation or and an entity-entity (E-E) relation. In our query graph
representation, all word-word relations have an equal weight of 1,
and the weight of each entity-entity relation (i.e., λe1,e2 ) is defined
by Equation (3). Finally, we calculate the edge potential as follows:

f (⟨t1, t2 ⟩) = λ⟨t1, t2⟩ · a(P (t1, t2 |di )),
(cid:26) λE · λe1, e2
(1 − λE )

if ⟨t1, t2 ⟩ is an E-E relation
if ⟨t1, t2 ⟩ is a W-W relation

λ⟨t1, t2⟩ =

(7)

(8)

where λ ⟨t1,t2 ⟩ measures the edge importance, and a(·) is the same
activation function as defined above. To simplify the calculation of
P(t1, t2|di ), we make an assumption that two tokens t1 and t2 are
conditionally independent given a document di . Then, we replace
P(t1, t2|di ) with P(t1|di )P(t2|di ) and substitute it in Equation (7).
Putting all together. After defining the node and edge potentials,
we can calculate the joint probability of each document di and
query q using Equation (5) as follows:

P (di, q) = (1 − λE )

(cid:213)

w ∈Gq |di

(9)
As shown in the above equation, SetRank will explicitly reward
paper capturing inter-entity relations and covering more unique
entities. Also, it uses λE to balance the word-based relevance with
entity-based relevance, and models entity type information in λe,e ′.

4 UNSUPERVISED MODEL SELECTION
Although being an unsupervised ranking framework, SetRank still
has some parameters that need to be appropriately set by ranking
model designers, including the weight of title/abstract field and the
relative importance of entity token λE . Previous study [41] shows
that these model parameters have significant influences on the
ranking performance and thus we need to choose them carefully.
Typically, these parameters are chosen to optimize the performance
over a validation set that is manually constructed and contains
the relevance label of each query-document pair. Though being
useful, the validation set is not always available, especially for
those applications (e.g., literature search) where labeling document
requires domain expertise.

To address the above problem, we propose an unsupervised
model selection algorithm which automatically chooses the param-
eter settings without resorting to a manually labeled validation
set. The key philosophy is that although people who design the
ranking model (i.e., ranking model designers) do not know the exact
“optimal” parameter settings, they do have prior knowledge about
the reasonable range for each of them. For example, the title field

Figure 3: An illustrative example showing the process of weighted
rank aggregation and the calculation of two different ranking dis-
tances (i.e., KT and posKT ).

weight should be set larger than the abstract field weight, and the
entity token weight λE should be set small if the returned entity
linking results are noisy. Our model selection algorithm leverages
such prior knowledge by letting the ranking model designer in-
put the search range of each parameter’s value. It will then return
the best value for each parameter within its corresponding search
range. We first describe our notations and formulate our problem
in Section 4.1. Then, we present our model selection algorithm in
Section 4.2.

4.1 Notations and Problem Formulation
Notations. We use SK to denote the collection of rankings over a
set of K documents: D = {d1, . . . , dk , . . . , dK }, k ∈ [K] = {1, . . . , K }.
We denote by π : [K] → [K] a complete ranking, where π (k) de-
in the ranking, and π −1(j) is
notes the position of document dk
the index of the document on position j. For example, given the
ranking: d3 ≻ d1 ≻ d2 ≻ d4, we will have π = [2, 3, 1, 4] and
π −1 = (3, 1, 2, 4). Furthermore, we use the symbol τ (instead of π )
to denote an incomplete ranking which includes only some of the
documents in D. If document dk
does not occur in the ranking, we
set τ (k) = 0, otherwise, τ (k) is the rank of document dk
. In the cor-
responding τ −1, those missing documents simply do not occur. For
example, given the ranking: d4 ≻ d2 ≻ d1, we have τ = [3, 2, 0, 1]
and τ −1 = (4, 2, 1). Finally, we let I (τ ) = {k |τ (k) > 0, k ∈ [K]} to
represent the index of documents that appear in the ranking list τ .
Problem Formulation. Given a parameterized ranking model Mθ
where θ denotes the set of all parameters (e.g., {k, b} in BM25, {µ}
in query likelihood model with dirichlet prior smoothing), we want
to find the best parameter settings θ ∗ such that the ranking model
Mθ ∗ achieves the best ranking performance over the space Q of all
queries. In practice, however, the space consisting of all possible
values of θ can be infinite and we cannot access all queries in Q.
Therefore, we assume ranking model designers will input p possible
sets of parameter values: Θ = {θ1, . . . , θp } and a finite subset of
queries Q ⊂ Q. Finally, we formulate our problem of unsupervised
model selection as follows:

Definition 1. (PROBLEM FORMULATION). Given a parameter-
ized ranking model Mθ , p candidate parameter settings Θ, and an
unlabeled query subset Q, we aim to find θ ∗ ∈ Θ such that Mθ ∗
achieves the best ranking performance over Q.

here is how we can evaluate the ranking performance of each Mθi
over a query q which has no labeled documents. To address this
challenge, we first leverage a weighted rank aggregation technique
to obtain an aggregated rank list and then evaluate the quality of
each Mθi
based on the agreement between its generated rank list
and the aggregated rank list. The key intuition here is that high-
quality ranking models will rank documents based on a similar
distribution while low-quality ranking models will rank documents
in a uniformly random fashion. Therefore, the agreement between
each rank list with the aggregated rank list serves as a good signal
of its quality.

At a high level, our model selection method is an iterative algo-
rithm which repeatedly aggregates multiple rankings (with their
corresponding weights) and uses the aggregated rank list to esti-
mate the quality of each of them. Given a query q, we first con-
struct p ranking models Mθi , i ∈ [1, . . . , p], one for each parameter
settings θi ∈ Θ and obtain its returned top-k rank list τi over
a document set Di (i.e., |Di | = k). Then, we construct a unified
document pool D = (cid:208)p
i=1 Di . After that, we use αi to denote the
confidence score of each ranking model Mθi
, and initialize all of
them with equal value 1
. During each iteration, we first aggregate
p
{τ1, . . . , τp }, weighted by {α1, . . . , αp }, and obtain the aggregated
rank list π . Then, we adjust the confidence score of each ranking
(i.e., αi ) based on the distance of two rankings: τi and
model Mθi
π . Here, we use π to denote the aggregated rank list because it is a
complete ranking over the document pool D.

Weighted Rank Aggregation. We aggregate multiple rank lists
using a variant of Borda counting method [6] which considers the
relative weight of each rank list. We calculate the score of each
document based on its position in each rank list as follows:

scor e(dj ) =

αi

(cid:0) |τi | + 1 − τi (dj )(cid:1) 1{j ∈ I (τi )},

(10)

p
(cid:213)

i =1

where |τi | denotes the length of a rank list τi , and 1{x } is an in-
dicator function. When document dj appears in the rank list τi ,
1{j ∈ I (τi )} equals to 1, otherwise, it equals to 0. The above equa-
tion will reward a document ranked at higher position (i.e., small
τi (dj )) in a high-quality rank list (i.e., large αi ) a larger score. Finally,
we obtain the aggregated rank of these documents based on their
corresponding scores. A concrete example in shown in Figure 3.
Confidence Score Adjustment. After we obtain the aggregated
rank list, we will need to adjust the confidence score αi of each
ranking model Mθi
based on the distance between τi and aggregated
rank list π . In order to compare the distance between an incomplete
rank list τi with a complete rank list π , we extend the classical
Kendall Tau distance [17] and define it as follows:
KT (τi | |π ) = (cid:213)

1{π (a) > π (b)}.

(11)

τi (a)<τi (b)
a,b ∈I (τi )

The above distance counts the number of pairwise disagreements
between τi and π . One limitation of this distance is that it does not
differentiate the importance of different ranking positions. Usually,
switching two documents in the top part of a rank list should be
penalized more, compared with switching another two documents
in the bottom part of a rank list. To model such intuition, we propose
a position-aware Kendall Tau distance and define it as follows:

posKT (τi | |π ) = (cid:213)

(cid:18)

1
log2(1 + π (b))

−

1
log2(1 + π (a))

(cid:19)

1{π (a) > π (b)}.

τi (a)<τi (b)
a,b ∈I (τi )

With the distance between two rankings defined, we can adjust the
confidence score as follows:

(12)

(13)

αi =

exp(−dist (τi | |π ))
i′ exp(−dist (τi′ | |π ))

,

(cid:205)

where dist(τi ||π ) can be either KT (τi ||π ) or posKT (τi ||π ) and we
will study how different this choice can influence the model selec-
tion results in Section 5.4. The key idea of the above equation is
to promote the ranking model which returns a ranked list better
aligned with the aggregated rank list.
Putting all together. Algorithm 1 summarizes our unsupervised
model selection process. Given a query q ∈ Q, we can iteratively
apply weighted rank aggregation and confidence score adjustment
until the algorithm converges. Then, we collect the converged
{ ˆα1, . . . , ˆαp }. Specifically, ˆαi is the confidence score of ranking
on query q. With a slight abuse of notation, we use
model Mθi
) to denote its accumulated confidence score. Given a set
score(Mθi
of queries Q, we run the former procedure for each query and sum
over all converged ˆαi . Finally, we return the ranking model Mθ ∗
which has the largest accumulated confidence score.

5 EXPERIMENTS
In this section, we evaluate our proposed SetRank framework as
well as unsupervised model selection algorithm on two datasets
from two scientific domains.

Entity Set Search of Scientific Literature: An Unsupervised Ranking Approach

SIGIR ’18, July 8–12, 2018, Ann Arbor, MI, USA

5.1 Datasets
We use two benchmark datasets2 for the experiments: Semantic
Scholar [39] in Computer Science (S2-CS) and TREC 2004&2005
Genomics Track in Biomedical science (TREC-BIO).
S2-CS contains 100 queries sampled from Semantic Scholar’s query
log, in which 40 queries are entity-set queries and the maximum
number of entities in a query is 5. Candidate documents are gen-
erated by pooling from variations of Semantic Scholar’s online
production system and all of them are manually labeled on a 5-level
scale. Entities in both queries and documents are linked to Freebase
using CMNS [13]. As the original dataset does not contain the entity
type information, we enhance it by retrieving each entity’s most
notable type in the latest Freebase dump3 based on its Freebase ID.
These types are organized by Freebase type hierarchy.
TREC-BIO includes 100 queries designed by biologists and the
candidate document pool is constructed based on the top results of
all submissions at that time. All candidate documents are labeled on
a 3-level scale. In these 100 queries, 86 of them are entity-set queries
and the maximum number of entities in a query is 11. The original
dataset contains no entity information and therefore we apply
PubTator [33], the state-of-the-art biomedical entity linking tool,
to obtain 5 types of entities (i.e., Gene, Disease, Chemical, Mutation,
and Species) in both queries and documents. We build a simple type
hierarchy with root node named ‘Thing’ and each first-level node
corresponds to one of the above 5 types.

5.2 Entity Linking Performance
We evaluate the query entity linking using precision and recall
at the query level. Specifically, an entity annotation is considered
correct if it appears in the gold labeled data (i.e., the strict evaluation
in [4]). The original S2-CS dataset provides such gold labeled data.
For TREC-BIO dataset, we asked two Master-level students with
biomedical science background to label all the linked entities as
well as the entities that they could identify in the queries. We also
report the entity linking performance on the general domain queries
(ClueWeb09 and ClueWeb12) for references [37]. As we can see
in Table 2, the overall linking performance of academic queries
is better than that of general domain queries, probably because
academic queries have less ambiguity. Also, recall of entity linking
in TREC-BIO dataset is very high. A possible reason is that the
biomedical entities have very distinctive tokens (e.g., “narcolepsy”
is a specific disease related to sleep and is seldom used in other
contexts) and thus it is relatively easier to recognize them.

5.3 Ranking Performance

5.3.1 Experimental Setup.

Evaluation metrics. Since documents in both datasets have multi-
level graded relevance, we use NDCG@{5,10,15,20} as our main
evaluation metrics. All evaluation is performed using standard
pytrec_eval tool [32]. Statistical significances are tested using two-
tailed t-test with p-value ≤ 0.05.
Baselines. We compare SetRank with 4 baseline ranking models:
Vector Space Model (BM25 [28]), Query Likelihood Model with

Dirichlet Prior smoothing (LM-DIR) or with Jelinek Mercer smooth-
ing (LM-JM) [41], and the Information-Based model (IB) [5]. All
models are applied to the paper’s title and abstract fields. Here, we
do not compete with Semantic Scholar’s production system and
ESR model [39] because they are supervised models trained over
user’s click information which is not available in our setting.

The parameters of all models, including the field weights, are set
using 5-fold cross validation over the queries in each benchmark
dataset using the same paradigm in [26] as follows. For each hold-
out fold, the other four folds are served as a validation set. A grid
search is applied to choose the optimal parameter settings that
maximize NDCG@20 on the validation set. Specifically, the title
and abstract field weights are selected from {1,5,10,15,20,50}; the
Dirichlet smoothing parameter µ and Jelinek Mercer smoothing
parameter λ are chosen from {500, 1000, 1500, 2000, 2500, 3000} and
{0.1, 0.2, . . . , 0.9}, respectively; the relative weight of entity token λE
used in SetRank is selected from {0, 0.1, . . . , 1}. The best performing
parameter settings are then saved for the hold-out evaluation.

5.3.2 Effectiveness of Leveraging Entity Information.
As mentioned before, the entity linking process is not perfect and
it generates some noisy entity annotations. Therefore, we first study
how different ranking models, including our proposed SetRank,
can leverage such noisy entity information to improve the ranking
performance. We evaluate three variations of each model – one
using only word information, one using only entity information,
and one using both pieces of information.

Results are shown in Table 3. We notice that the usefulness
of entity information is inconclusive for baseline models. On S2-
CS dataset, adding entity information can improve the ranking
performance, while on TREC-BIO dataset, it will drag down the
performance of all baseline methods. This resonates with previous
findings in [16] that simply adding entities into queries and post-
ing them to existing ranking models does not work for biomedical
literature retrieval. Compared with baseline methods, SetRank suc-
cessfully combines the word and entity information and effectively
leverages such noisy entity information to improve the ranking
performance. Furthermore, SetRank can better utilize each single
information source, either word or entity, than other baseline mod-
els thanks to our proposed query graph representation. Overall,
SetRank significantly outperforms all variations of baseline models.

5.3.3 Ranking Performance on Entity-Set Queries.
We further study each model’s ranking performance on entity-set
queries. There are 40 and 86 entity-set queries in S2-CS and TREC-
BIO, respectively. We denote these subsets of entity-set queries as
S2-CS-ESQ and TREC-BIO-ESQ. As shown in Table 4, SetRank sig-
nificantly outperforms the best variation of all baseline methods
on S2-CS-ESQ and TREC-BIO-ESQ by at least 25% and 14% respec-
tively in terms of NDCG@5. Also, we can see the advantages of
SetRank over the baselines on entity-set queries are larger than

fectiveness of modeling entity set information.

5.3.4 Effectiveness of Modeling Entity Relation and Entity Type.
To study how the inter-entity relation and entity type informa-
tion can contribute to document ranking, we compare SetRank with
two of its variants, SetRank−t and SetRank−t s . The first variant
models entity relation among the set but ignores the entity type
information, and the second variant simply neglects both entity
relation and type.

Results are shown in Table 5. First, we compare SetRank−t with
SetRank−t s and find that modeling the entity relation in entity
sets can significantly improve the ranking results. Such improve-
ment is especially obvious on the entity-set query sets S2-CS-ESQ
and TREC-BIO-ESQ. Also, by comparing SetRank with SetRank−t ,
we can see adding entity type information can further improve
ranking performance. In addition, we present a concrete case study
for one entity-set query in Table 6. The top-2 papers returned by
SetRank−t s are focusing on video game without discussing its rela-
tion with reinforcement learning. In comparison, SetRank considers
the entity relations and returns the paper mentioning both entities.

5.3.5 Analysis of Entity Token Weight λE .
We introduce the entity token weight λE in Eq. (6) to combine
the entity-based and word-based relevance scores. In all previous
experiments, we choose its value using cross validation. Here, we
study how this parameter will influence the ranking performance
by constructing multiple SetRank models with different λE and
directly report their performance on all 100 queries.

As shown in Figure 4, for S2-CS dataset, SetRank’s ranking
performance first increases as λE increases until it reaches 0.7 and
then starts to decrease when we further increase λE . However, for
TREC-BIO dataset, the optimal value of λE is around 0.3, and if we
increases λE over 0.6, the ranking performance will drop quickly.

generates totally 7 × 4 × 4 × 4 × 4 = 1, 792 possible parameter
settings and for each of them we can construct a ranking model.
We first apply our unsupervised model selection algorithm (with
either KT or posKT as the ranking distance) and obtain the most
confident parameter settings returned by it. Then, we plug in these
parameter settings into SetRank and denote it as AutoSetRank. For
reference, we also calculate the average performance of all 1,792
ranking models.

set do perform better than the ones returned by our unsupervised
model selection algorithm, the difference is not significant. For
TREC-BIO dataset, it is surprising to find that AutoSetRank-posKT
can slightly outperforms SetRank tuned on validation set. Further-
more, the performance of AutoSetRank function is higher than the
average performances of all possible ranking models by 2 standard
deviations, which demonstrates the effectiveness of our unsuper-
vised model selection algorithm.

5.5 Use Case Study: Bio-Literature Search
In this section we demonstrate the effectiveness of SetRank in
a biomedical use case. As preparation, we build a biomedical lit-
erature search engine based on over 27 million papers retrieved
from PubMed. Entities in all papers are extracted and typed using
PubTator. This search system is cold-started with our proposed
SetRank model and we show how SetRank can help this search
system to accommodate a given entity-set query and returns a high-
quality rank list of papers relevant to the query. Comparison with
PubMed, a widely used search engine for biomedical literature, will
also be discussed.
A biomedical case. Consider the following case of a biomedical
information need. Genomics studies often identify sets of genes
as having important roles to play in the processes or conditions
under investigation, and the investigators seek to understand better
what biological insights such a list of genes might provide. Suppose
such a study, having examined brain gene expression patterns in
old mice, identifies ten genes as being of potential interest. The
investigator forms a query with these 10 genes, submits it to a
literature search engine, and examines the top ten returned papers
to look for an association between this gene set and a disease. The
query consists of symbols of the 10 genes: “APP, APOE, PSEN1,
SORL1, PSEN2, ACE, CLU, BDNF, IL1B, MAPT ”.
Relevance criterion. We choose the above ten genes for our il-
lustration because these are actually top genes associated with
Alzheimer’s disease according to DisGeNET [25], and it is unlikely
that there is another completely different (and unknown) common-
ality among them. Therefore, a retrieved paper is relevant if and
only if it discusses at least one of the query genes in the context of
Alzheimer’s disease. Furthermore, among all relevant papers, we
prefer those covering more unique genes.

Result analysis. The top-5 papers returned by PubMed4 and our
system are shown in Table 8. We see that the “Alzheimer’s disease” is
explicitly mentioned in the title of all the five papers returned by our
system, and the top two papers cover 6 unique genes among the total
10 genes. All five papers returned by SetRank are highly relevant,
since they all focus on the association between a subset of our
query genes and Alzheimer’s disease. In contrast, the top-5 papers
retrieved by PubMed are dominated by two genes (i.e., APOE4 and
BDNF) and contain none of the remaining eight. Only the 1st of the
five papers is highly relevant. It focuses on the association between
Alzheimer’s disease (mentioned explicitly in the title) and our query
gene set. Three other papers (ranked 2nd to 4th) are marginally
relevant, in the sense that Alzheimer’s disease is the context but
not the focus of their studies. The paper ranked 5th is irrelevant.
Therefore, users will prefer SetRank since it returns papers covering
a large-portion of an entity-set query and helps them to find the
association between this entity set with Alzheimer’s disease.

6 CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK
In this paper, we study the problem of searching scientific literature
using entity-set queries. A distinctive characteristic of entity-set
queries is that they reflect user’s interest in inter-entity relations. To
capture such information need, we propose SetRank, an unsuper-
vised ranking framework which explicitly models entity relations
among the entity set. Second, we develop a novel unsupervised
model selection algorithm based on weighted rank aggregation to
select SetRank’s parameters without relying on a labeled validation
set. Experimental results on two benchmark datasets corroborate
the effectiveness of SetRank and the usefulness of our model se-
lection algorithm. We further discuss the power of SetRankwith a
real-world use case of biomedical literature search.

As a future direction, we would like to explore how we can
go beyond pairwise entity relations and integrate higher-order
entity relations into the current SetRank framework. Besides, it
would be interesting to explore whether SetRank can effectively
model domain expert’s prior knowledge about the relative impor-
tance of entity relations. Furthermore, the incorporation of user

4Querying PubMed with the exact same query returns 0 document. To get reasonable results,
PubMed users have to insert an OR logic between every pairs of genes, and change the default
“sorting by most recent” to “sorting by best match”.

ABSTRACT
Literature search is critical for any scientific research. Different
from Web or general domain search, a large portion of queries in
scientific literature search are entity-set queries, that is, multiple
entities of possibly different types. Entity-set queries reflect user’s
need for finding documents that contain multiple entities and reveal
inter-entity relationships and thus pose non-trivial challenges to
existing search algorithms that model each entity separately. How-
ever, entity-set queries are usually sparse (i.e., not so repetitive),
which makes ineffective many supervised ranking models that rely
heavily on associated click history. To address these challenges, we
introduce SetRank, an unsupervised ranking framework that mod-
els inter-entity relationships and captures entity type information.
Furthermore, we develop a novel unsupervised model selection
algorithm, based on the technique of weighted rank aggregation,
to automatically choose the parameter settings in SetRank without
resorting to a labeled validation set. We evaluate our proposed un-
supervised approach using datasets from TREC Genomics Tracks
and Semantic Scholar’s query log. The experiments demonstrate
that SetRank significantly outperforms the baseline unsupervised
models, especially on entity-set queries, and our model selection
algorithm effectively chooses suitable parameter settings.

1 INTRODUCTION
Literature search helps a researcher identify relevant papers and
summarize essential claims about a topic, forming a critical step
in any scientific research. With the fast-growing volume of scien-
tific publications, a good literature search engine is essential to
researchers, especially in the domains like computer science and
biomedical science where the literature collections are so massive,
diverse, and rapidly evolving—few people can master the state-of-
the-art comprehensively and in depth.

A large set of literature search queries contain multiple entities
which can be either concrete instances (e.g., GABP (a gene)) or ab-
stract concepts (e.g., clustering). We refer these queries as entity-set

queries. For example, a computer scientist may want to find out
how knowledge base can be used for document retrieval and thus
issues a query “knowledge base for document retrieval”, which is
an entity-set query containing two entities. Similarly, a biologist
may want to survey how genes GABP, TERT, and CD11b are associ-
ated with cancer and submits a query “GABP TERT CD11b cancer”,
another entity-set query with one disease and three gene entities.
Compared with typical short keyword queries, a distinctive char-
acteristic of entity-set queries is that they reflect user’s need for
finding documents containing inter-entity relations. For example,
among 50 queries collected from biologists in 2005 as part of TREC
Genomics Track [15], 40 of them are explicitly formulated as find-
ing relations among at least two entities. In most cases, a user who
submits an entity-set query will expect to get a ranked list of docu-
ments that are most relevant to the whole entity set. Therefore, as
in the previous examples, returning a paper about only knowledge
bases or only one gene GABP is unsatisfactory.

Entity-set queries pose non-trivial challenges to existing search
platforms. For example, among the 100 queries1 released by Se-
mantic Scholar (S2), 40 of them are entity-set queries and S2’s
production ranking system performs poorly on these entity-set
queries, as shown in Table 1. The difficulties of handling entity-set
queries mainly come from two aspects. First, entity relations within
entity sets have not been modeled effectively. The association or co-
occurrence of multiple entities has not gained adequate attention
from existing ranking models. As a result, those models will rank
papers where a single distinct entity appears multiple times higher
than those containing many distinct entities. Second, entity-set
queries are particularly challenging for supervised ranking models.
As manual labeling of document relevance in academic search re-
quires domain expertise, it is too expensive to train a ranking model
based purely on manually labeling. Most systems will first apply
an off-the-shelf unsupervised ranking model during their cold-start
process and then collect user interaction data (e.g., click informa-
tion). Unfortunately, entity-set queries are usually sparse (i.e., not so
repetitive), and have less associated click information. Furthermore,
many off-the-shelf unsupervised models cannot return reasonably
good candidate documents for entity-set queries within the top-20

positions. Many highly relevant documents will not be presented
to users, which further compromises the usefulness of clicking
information.

This paper tackles the new challenge—improving the search qual-
ity of scientific literature on entity-set queries and proposes an unsu-
pervised ranking approach. We introduce SetRank, an unsupervised
ranking framework that explicitly models inter-entity relations and
captures entity type information. SetRank first links entity men-
tions in query and documents to an external knowledge-base. Then,
each document is represented with both bag-of-words and bag-
of-entities representations [37, 38] and fits two language models
respectively. On the query side, a novel heterogeneous graph rep-
resentation is proposed to model complex entity information (e.g.,
entity type) and entity relations within the set. This heterogeneous
query graph represents all the information need in that query. Fi-
nally, the query-document matching is defined as a graph covering
process and each document is ranked based on the information need
it covers in the query graph.

Although being an unsupervised ranking framework, SetRank still
has some parameters that need to be appropriately learned using
a labeled validation set. To further automate the process of rank-
ing model development, we develop a novel unsupervised model
selection algorithm based on the technique of weighted rank ag-
gregation. Given a set of queries with no labeled documents, and a
set of candidate parameter settings, this algorithm automatically
learns the most suitable parameter settings for that set of queries.
The significance of our proposed unsupervised ranking approach
is two-fold. First, SetRank itself, as an unsupervised ranking model,
boosts the literature search performance on entity-set queries. Sec-
ond, SetRank can be adopted during the cold-start process of a
search system, which enables the collection of high-quality click
data for training subsequent supervised ranking model. Our experi-
ments on S2’s benchmark datasets and TREC 2004 & 2005 Genomics
Tracks [14, 15] demonstrate the usefulness of our unsupervised
model selection algorithm and the effectiveness of SetRank for
searching scientific literature, especially on entity-set queries.
In summary, this work makes the following contributions:

(1) A new research problem, effective entity-set search of scientific

literature, is studied.

(2) SetRank, an unsupervised ranking framework, is proposed,
which models inter-entity relations and captures entity type
information.

(3) A novel unsupervised model selection algorithm is developed,
which automatically selects SetRank’s parameter settings with-
out resorting to a labeled validation set.

(4) Extensive experiments are conducted in two scientific domains,
demonstrating the effectiveness of SetRank and our unsuper-
vised model selection algorithm.

The remaining of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2
discusses related work. Section 3 presents our ranking framework
SetRank. Section 4 presents the unsupervised model selection al-
gorithm. Section 5 reports and analyzes the experimental results
on two benchmark datasets and shows a case study of SetRank for
biomedical literature search. Finally, Section 6 concludes this work
with discussions on some future directions.

2 RELATED WORK
We examine related work in three aspects: academic search, entity-
aware ranking model, and automatic ranking model selection.

2.1 Academic Search
The practical importance of finding highly relevant papers in scien-
tific literature has motivated the development of many academic
search systems. Google Scholar is arguably the most widely used
system due to its large coverage. However, the ranking result of
Google Scholar is still far from satisfactory because of its bias to-
ward highly cited papers [1]. As a result, researchers may choose
other academic search platforms, such as CiteSeerX [34], AMiner
[31], PubMed [21], Microsoft Academic Search [30] and Semantic
Scholar [39]. Research efforts of many such systems focus on the
analytical tasks of scholar data such as author name disambiguation
[31], paper importance modeling [29], and entity-based distinctive
summarization [27]. However, this work focuses on ad-hoc docu-
ment retrieval and ranking in academic search. The most relevant
work to ours is [39] in which entity embeddings are used to obtain
“soft match” feature of each ⟨query, document⟩ pair. However, [39]
requires training data to combine word-based and entity-based
relevance scores and to select parameter settings, which is rather
different from our unsupervised approach.

2.2 Entity-aware Ranking Model
Entities, such as people, locations, or abstract concepts, are natu-
ral units for organizing and retrieving information [10]. Previous
studies found that over 70% of Bing’s query and more than 50%
of traffic in Semantic Scholar are related to entities [12, 39]. The
recent availability of large-scale knowledge repositories and accu-
rate entity linking tools have further motivated a growing body of
work on entity-aware ranking models. These models can be roughly
categorized into three classes: expansion-based, projection-based,
and representation-based.

The expansion-based methods use entity descriptions from knowl-
edge repositories to enhance query representation. Xu et al. [40]
use entity descriptions in Wikipedia as pseudo relevance feedback
corpus to obtain cleaner expansion terms; Xiong and Callen [36]
utilize the description of Freebase entities related to the query for
query expansion; Dalton et al. [7] expand a query using the text
fields of the attributes of the query-related entities and generate
richer learning-to-rank features based on the expanded texts.

The projection-based methods try to project both query and doc-
ument onto an entity space for comparison. Liu and Fang [20] use
entities from a query and its related documents to construct a latent
entity space and then connect the query and documents based on
the descriptions of the latent entities. Xiong and Callen [35] use the
textual features among query, entities, and documents to model the
query-entity and entity-document connections. These additional
connections between query and document are then utilized in a
learning-to-rank model. A fundamental difference of our work from
the above methods is that we do not represent query and document
using external terms/entities that they do not contain. This is to
avoid adding noisy expansion of terms/entities that may not reflect
the information need in the original user query.

Entity Set Search of Scientific Literature: An Unsupervised Ranking Approach

SIGIR ’18, July 8–12, 2018, Ann Arbor, MI, USA

The representation-based methods, as a recent trend for utiliz-
ing entity information, aim to build entity-enhanced text repre-
sentation and combine it with traditional word-based represen-
tation [38]. Xiong et al. [37] propose a bag-of-entities represen-
tation and demonstrated its effectiveness for vector space model.
Raviv et al. [26] leverage the surface names of entities to build
an entity-based language model. Many supervised ranking mod-
els are proposed to apply learning-to-rank methods for combining
entity-based signals with word-based signals. For example, ESR [39]
uses entity embeddings to compute entity-based query-document
matching score and then combines it with word-based score using
RankSVM. Following the same spirit, Xiong et al. [38] propose a
word-entity duet framework that simultaneously models the entity
annotation uncertainty and trains the ranking model. Comparing
with the above methods, we also use the bag-of-entity representa-
tion but combine it with word-based representation in an unsuper-
vised way. Also, to the best of our knowledge, we are the first to
capture entity relation and type information in an unsupervised
entity-aware ranking model.

2.3 Automatic Ranking Model Selection
Most ranking models need to manually set many parameter val-
ues. To automate the process of selecting parameter settings, some
AutoML methods [3, 8] are proposed. Nevertheless, these methods
still require a validation set which contains queries with labeled
documents. In this paper, we develop an unsupervised model selec-
tion algorithm, based on rank aggregation, to automatically choose
parameter settings without resorting to a labeled validation set.
Rank aggregation aims to combine multiple existing rankings into
a joint ranking. Fox and Shaw [9] propose some deterministic func-
tions to combine rankings heuristically. Klementiev et al. [18, 19]
propose an unsupervised learning algorithm for rank aggregation
based on a linear combination of ranking functions. Another re-
lated line of work is to model rankings using a statistical model
(e.g., Plackett-Luce model) and aggregate them based on statistical
inference [11, 22, 42]. Lately, Bhowmik and Ghosh [2] propose to
use object attributes to augment some standard rank aggregation
framework. Compared with these methods, our proposed algorithm
goes beyond just combining multiple rankings and uses aggregated
ranking to guide the selection of parameter settings.

3 RANKING FRAMEWORK
This section presents our unsupervised ranking framework for
leveraging entity (set) information in search. Our framework pro-
vides a principled way to rank a set of documents D for a query q. In
this framework, we represent each document using standard bag-of-
words and bag-of-entities representations [37, 38] (Section 3.1) and
represent the query using a novel heterogeneous graph (Section 3.2)
which naturally model the entity set information. Finally, we model
the query-document matching as a “graph covering" process, as
described in Section 3.3.

3.1 Document Representation
We represent each document using both word and entity infor-
mation. For words, we use standard bag-of-words representation
and treat each unigram as a word. For entities, we adopt an en-
tity linking tool (details described in Section 5.2) that utilizes a

prised of two fields (i.e., title, abstract) with their corresponding bag-
of-words and bag-of-entities representations.

knowledge base/graph (e.g., Wikidata or Freebase) where entities
have unique IDs. Given an input text, this tool will find the entity
mentions (i.e., entity surface names) in the text and link each of
them to a disambiguated entity in the knowledge base/graph. For
example, given the input document title “Training linear SVMs in
linear time”, this tool will link the entity mention “SVMs”’ to the
entity “Support Vector Machine” with Freebase id ‘/m/0hc2f’. Pre-
vious studies [26, 37] show that when the entity linking error is
within a reasonable range, the returned entity annotations, though
noisy, can still improve the overall search performance, partially
due to the following:
(1) Polysemy resolution. Different entities with the same surface
name will be resolved by the entity linker. For example, the fruit
“Apple” (with id ‘/m/014j1m’) will be disambiguated with the
company “Apple” (with id ‘/m/0k8z’).

(2) Synonymy resolution. Different entity surface names cor-
responding to the same entity will be identified and merged.
For example, the entity “United States of America” (with id
‘/m/09c7w0’) can have different surface names including “USA”,
“United States”, and “U.S.” [26]. The entity linker can map all
these surface names to the same entity.

After linking all the entity mentions in a document to entities
in the knowledge base, we can obtain the bag-of-entities represen-
tation of this document. Then, we fit two language models (LMs)
for this document: one being word-based (i.e., traditional unigram
LM) and the other being entity-based. Notice that in the literature
search scenario, documents (i.e., papers) usually contain multiple
fields, such as title, abstract, and full text. We model each document
field using a separate bag-of-words representation and a separate
bag-of-entities representation, as shown in Figure 1.

To exploit such intra-document structures, we generally assume
a document di has k fields di = {di,1, . . . , di,k } and thus the doc-
ument collection can be separated into k parts: {D1, . . . , Dk }. Fol-
lowing [24], we assign each field a weight δj and formulate the
generation process of a token t given the document di as follows:

p(t |di ) =

p(t |di, j )p(di, j |di ),

p(di, j |di ) =

k
(cid:213)

Notice the a token t can be either a unigram w or an entity e, and the
field weight δj can be either manually set based on prior knowledge
or automatically learned using the mechanism described in Sec-
tion 4. The token generation probability under each document field
p(t |di, j ) can be obtained from the maximum likelihood estimate
with Dirichlet prior smoothing [41] as follows:

3.2 Query Representation
Given an input query q, we first apply the same entity linker used
for document representation to extract all the entity information
in the query. Then, we design a novel heterogeneous graph to
represent this query q, denoted as Gq . Such a graph representation
captures both word and entity information in the query and models
the entity relations. A concrete example is shown in Figure 2.
Node representation. In this heterogeneous query graph, each
node represents a query token. As a token can be either a word or
an entity, there are two different types of nodes in this graph.
Edge representation. We use an edge to represent a latent relation
between two query tokens. In this work, we consider two types
of latent relations: word-word relation and entity-entity relation.
For word-word relation, we add an edge for each pair of adjacent
word tokens with equal weight 1. For instance, given an query
“Atari video games”, we will add two edges, one between word pairs
⟨Atari, video⟩ and the other between ⟨video, game⟩. On the entity
side, we aim to emphasize all the possible entity-entity relations,
and thus add an edge between each pair of entity tokens.
Modeling entity type. The type information of each query entity
can further reveal the user’s information need. Therefore, we assign
the weight of each entity-entity relation based on these two entities’
type information. Intuitively, if the types of two entities are distant
from each other in a type hierarchy, then the relation between these
two entities should have a larger weight. A similar idea is exploited
in [10] and found useful for type-aware entity retrieval.

Mathematically, we use ϕe to denote the type of entity e; use
LCAu,v to denote the Lowest Common Ancestor (LCA) of two
nodes u and v in a given tree (i.e., type hierarchy), and use l(u, v)
to denote the length of a path between node u and node v. In
Figure 2, for example, the entity tokens ‘/m/0hjlw’ and ‘/m/0xwj’,
corresponding to “reinforcement learning” and “Atari”, have types
‘education.field_of_study’ and ‘computer.game’, respectively. The
Lowest Common Ancestor of these two types in the type hierarchy
is ‘Thing’. Finally, we define the relation strength between entity
e1 and entity e2 as follows:

LCAe1, e2
λe1, e2

= LCA(ϕe1, ϕe2 ),
= 1 + max (cid:8)l (ϕe1, LCAe1, e2 ), l (ϕe2, LCAe1, e2 )(cid:9) .

(3)

(4)

Our proposed heterogeneous query graph representation is general
and can be extended. For example, we can apply dependency parsing
for verbose queries, and only add an edge between two word tokens
that have direct dependency relation. Also, if the importance of each

graph representation of one query. Word-word relations are
marked by dash lines and entity-entity relations are marked by
solid lines. Different solid line colors represent different relation
strengths based on two entities’ types.

entity-entity relation is given, we can then set the edge weights
correspondingly. We leave these extensions for future works.

3.3 Document Ranking using Query Graph
Our proposed heterogeneous query graph Gq represents all infor-
mation need in the user-issued query. Such need can be either to
find document discussing one particular entity or to identify papers
studying an important inter-entity relation. Intuitively, a document
that can satisfy more information need should be ranked at a higher
position. To quantify such information need that is explained by a
document, we define the following graph covering process.
Query graph covering. If a query token t ∈ q exists in a document
di , we say di covers the node in Gq that corresponds to this token.
Similarly, if a pair of query tokens t1 and t2 exists in di , we say di
covers the edge in Gq that corresponds to the relation of this token
pair ⟨t1, t2⟩. The subgraph of Gq that is covered by the document
di , denoted as Gq |di
, represents the information need in the query
q that is explained by the document di .

Furthermore, we follow the same spirit of [23] and view the
as a Markov Network, based on which we define
subgraph Gq |di
the joint probability of the document di and the query q as follows:

1

Z

(5)

(cid:214)

f (c),

c ∈Gq |di

P (di, q) def=

log ψ (c) rank= (cid:213)
c ∈Gq |di

ψ (c) rank= (cid:213)
c ∈Gq |di
where Z is a normalization factor, c indexes the cliques in graph, and
ψ (c) is the non-negative potential defined on c. The last equation
holds as we let ψ (c) = exp[f (c)]. Notice that if Gq |d1
is a subgraph
of Gq |d2
which means document d1 covers less information than
document d2 does, we should have P(d1, q) < P(d2, q). Therefore,
we should design f (·) to satisfy the constraint f (c) > 0, ∀c.

In this work, we focus on modeling each single entity and pair-
wise relations between two entities. Therefore, each clique c can
be either a node or an edge in the graph. Modeling higher-order
relations among more than two entities (i.e., cliques with size larger
than 2) is left for future work. We define the potential functions for
a single node and an edge as follows:
Node potential. Node potential quantifies the information need
contained in a single node t, which can be either a word token w
or an entity token e. To balance the relative weight of a word token
and an entity token, we introduce a parameter λE ∈ [0, 1], and

define the node potential function f (·) as follows:

f (t ) =

(cid:26) λE · a(P (t |di ))

(1 − λE ) · a(P (t |di ))

if token t is an entity token
if token t is a word token

(6)

√

where a(·) is an activation function that transforms a raw probabil-
ity to a node potential. Here, we set a(x) =
x in order to amplify
P(t |di ) which has a relatively small value.
Edge potential. Edge potential quantifies the information need
contained in an edge ⟨t1, t2⟩ that can be either a word-word (W-W)
relation or and an entity-entity (E-E) relation. In our query graph
representation, all word-word relations have an equal weight of 1,
and the weight of each entity-entity relation (i.e., λe1,e2 ) is defined
by Equation (3). Finally, we calculate the edge potential as follows:

f (⟨t1, t2 ⟩) = λ⟨t1, t2⟩ · a(P (t1, t2 |di )),
(cid:26) λE · λe1, e2
(1 − λE )

if ⟨t1, t2 ⟩ is an E-E relation
if ⟨t1, t2 ⟩ is a W-W relation

λ⟨t1, t2⟩ =

(7)

(8)

where λ ⟨t1,t2 ⟩ measures the edge importance, and a(·) is the same
activation function as defined above. To simplify the calculation of
P(t1, t2|di ), we make an assumption that two tokens t1 and t2 are
conditionally independent given a document di . Then, we replace
P(t1, t2|di ) with P(t1|di )P(t2|di ) and substitute it in Equation (7).
Putting all together. After defining the node and edge potentials,
we can calculate the joint probability of each document di and
query q using Equation (5) as follows:

P (di, q) = (1 − λE )

(cid:213)

w ∈Gq |di

(9)
As shown in the above equation, SetRank will explicitly reward
paper capturing inter-entity relations and covering more unique
entities. Also, it uses λE to balance the word-based relevance with
entity-based relevance, and models entity type information in λe,e ′.

4 UNSUPERVISED MODEL SELECTION
Although being an unsupervised ranking framework, SetRank still
has some parameters that need to be appropriately set by ranking
model designers, including the weight of title/abstract field and the
relative importance of entity token λE . Previous study [41] shows
that these model parameters have significant influences on the
ranking performance and thus we need to choose them carefully.
Typically, these parameters are chosen to optimize the performance
over a validation set that is manually constructed and contains
the relevance label of each query-document pair. Though being
useful, the validation set is not always available, especially for
those applications (e.g., literature search) where labeling document
requires domain expertise.

To address the above problem, we propose an unsupervised
model selection algorithm which automatically chooses the param-
eter settings without resorting to a manually labeled validation
set. The key philosophy is that although people who design the
ranking model (i.e., ranking model designers) do not know the exact
“optimal” parameter settings, they do have prior knowledge about
the reasonable range for each of them. For example, the title field

Figure 3: An illustrative example showing the process of weighted
rank aggregation and the calculation of two different ranking dis-
tances (i.e., KT and posKT ).

weight should be set larger than the abstract field weight, and the
entity token weight λE should be set small if the returned entity
linking results are noisy. Our model selection algorithm leverages
such prior knowledge by letting the ranking model designer in-
put the search range of each parameter’s value. It will then return
the best value for each parameter within its corresponding search
range. We first describe our notations and formulate our problem
in Section 4.1. Then, we present our model selection algorithm in
Section 4.2.

4.1 Notations and Problem Formulation
Notations. We use SK to denote the collection of rankings over a
set of K documents: D = {d1, . . . , dk , . . . , dK }, k ∈ [K] = {1, . . . , K }.
We denote by π : [K] → [K] a complete ranking, where π (k) de-
in the ranking, and π −1(j) is
notes the position of document dk
the index of the document on position j. For example, given the
ranking: d3 ≻ d1 ≻ d2 ≻ d4, we will have π = [2, 3, 1, 4] and
π −1 = (3, 1, 2, 4). Furthermore, we use the symbol τ (instead of π )
to denote an incomplete ranking which includes only some of the
documents in D. If document dk
does not occur in the ranking, we
set τ (k) = 0, otherwise, τ (k) is the rank of document dk
. In the cor-
responding τ −1, those missing documents simply do not occur. For
example, given the ranking: d4 ≻ d2 ≻ d1, we have τ = [3, 2, 0, 1]
and τ −1 = (4, 2, 1). Finally, we let I (τ ) = {k |τ (k) > 0, k ∈ [K]} to
represent the index of documents that appear in the ranking list τ .
Problem Formulation. Given a parameterized ranking model Mθ
where θ denotes the set of all parameters (e.g., {k, b} in BM25, {µ}
in query likelihood model with dirichlet prior smoothing), we want
to find the best parameter settings θ ∗ such that the ranking model
Mθ ∗ achieves the best ranking performance over the space Q of all
queries. In practice, however, the space consisting of all possible
values of θ can be infinite and we cannot access all queries in Q.
Therefore, we assume ranking model designers will input p possible
sets of parameter values: Θ = {θ1, . . . , θp } and a finite subset of
queries Q ⊂ Q. Finally, we formulate our problem of unsupervised
model selection as follows:

Definition 1. (PROBLEM FORMULATION). Given a parameter-
ized ranking model Mθ , p candidate parameter settings Θ, and an
unlabeled query subset Q, we aim to find θ ∗ ∈ Θ such that Mθ ∗
achieves the best ranking performance over Q.

here is how we can evaluate the ranking performance of each Mθi
over a query q which has no labeled documents. To address this
challenge, we first leverage a weighted rank aggregation technique
to obtain an aggregated rank list and then evaluate the quality of
each Mθi
based on the agreement between its generated rank list
and the aggregated rank list. The key intuition here is that high-
quality ranking models will rank documents based on a similar
distribution while low-quality ranking models will rank documents
in a uniformly random fashion. Therefore, the agreement between
each rank list with the aggregated rank list serves as a good signal
of its quality.

At a high level, our model selection method is an iterative algo-
rithm which repeatedly aggregates multiple rankings (with their
corresponding weights) and uses the aggregated rank list to esti-
mate the quality of each of them. Given a query q, we first con-
struct p ranking models Mθi , i ∈ [1, . . . , p], one for each parameter
settings θi ∈ Θ and obtain its returned top-k rank list τi over
a document set Di (i.e., |Di | = k). Then, we construct a unified
document pool D = (cid:208)p
i=1 Di . After that, we use αi to denote the
confidence score of each ranking model Mθi
, and initialize all of
them with equal value 1
. During each iteration, we first aggregate
p
{τ1, . . . , τp }, weighted by {α1, . . . , αp }, and obtain the aggregated
rank list π . Then, we adjust the confidence score of each ranking
(i.e., αi ) based on the distance of two rankings: τi and
model Mθi
π . Here, we use π to denote the aggregated rank list because it is a
complete ranking over the document pool D.

Weighted Rank Aggregation. We aggregate multiple rank lists
using a variant of Borda counting method [6] which considers the
relative weight of each rank list. We calculate the score of each
document based on its position in each rank list as follows:

scor e(dj ) =

αi

(cid:0) |τi | + 1 − τi (dj )(cid:1) 1{j ∈ I (τi )},

(10)

p
(cid:213)

i =1

where |τi | denotes the length of a rank list τi , and 1{x } is an in-
dicator function. When document dj appears in the rank list τi ,
1{j ∈ I (τi )} equals to 1, otherwise, it equals to 0. The above equa-
tion will reward a document ranked at higher position (i.e., small
τi (dj )) in a high-quality rank list (i.e., large αi ) a larger score. Finally,
we obtain the aggregated rank of these documents based on their
corresponding scores. A concrete example in shown in Figure 3.
Confidence Score Adjustment. After we obtain the aggregated
rank list, we will need to adjust the confidence score αi of each
ranking model Mθi
based on the distance between τi and aggregated
rank list π . In order to compare the distance between an incomplete
rank list τi with a complete rank list π , we extend the classical
Kendall Tau distance [17] and define it as follows:
KT (τi | |π ) = (cid:213)

1{π (a) > π (b)}.

(11)

τi (a)<τi (b)
a,b ∈I (τi )

The above distance counts the number of pairwise disagreements
between τi and π . One limitation of this distance is that it does not
differentiate the importance of different ranking positions. Usually,
switching two documents in the top part of a rank list should be
penalized more, compared with switching another two documents
in the bottom part of a rank list. To model such intuition, we propose
a position-aware Kendall Tau distance and define it as follows:

posKT (τi | |π ) = (cid:213)

(cid:18)

1
log2(1 + π (b))

−

1
log2(1 + π (a))

(cid:19)

1{π (a) > π (b)}.

τi (a)<τi (b)
a,b ∈I (τi )

With the distance between two rankings defined, we can adjust the
confidence score as follows:

(12)

(13)

αi =

exp(−dist (τi | |π ))
i′ exp(−dist (τi′ | |π ))

,

(cid:205)

where dist(τi ||π ) can be either KT (τi ||π ) or posKT (τi ||π ) and we
will study how different this choice can influence the model selec-
tion results in Section 5.4. The key idea of the above equation is
to promote the ranking model which returns a ranked list better
aligned with the aggregated rank list.
Putting all together. Algorithm 1 summarizes our unsupervised
model selection process. Given a query q ∈ Q, we can iteratively
apply weighted rank aggregation and confidence score adjustment
until the algorithm converges. Then, we collect the converged
{ ˆα1, . . . , ˆαp }. Specifically, ˆαi is the confidence score of ranking
on query q. With a slight abuse of notation, we use
model Mθi
) to denote its accumulated confidence score. Given a set
score(Mθi
of queries Q, we run the former procedure for each query and sum
over all converged ˆαi . Finally, we return the ranking model Mθ ∗
which has the largest accumulated confidence score.

5 EXPERIMENTS
In this section, we evaluate our proposed SetRank framework as
well as unsupervised model selection algorithm on two datasets
from two scientific domains.

Entity Set Search of Scientific Literature: An Unsupervised Ranking Approach

SIGIR ’18, July 8–12, 2018, Ann Arbor, MI, USA

5.1 Datasets
We use two benchmark datasets2 for the experiments: Semantic
Scholar [39] in Computer Science (S2-CS) and TREC 2004&2005
Genomics Track in Biomedical science (TREC-BIO).
S2-CS contains 100 queries sampled from Semantic Scholar’s query
log, in which 40 queries are entity-set queries and the maximum
number of entities in a query is 5. Candidate documents are gen-
erated by pooling from variations of Semantic Scholar’s online
production system and all of them are manually labeled on a 5-level
scale. Entities in both queries and documents are linked to Freebase
using CMNS [13]. As the original dataset does not contain the entity
type information, we enhance it by retrieving each entity’s most
notable type in the latest Freebase dump3 based on its Freebase ID.
These types are organized by Freebase type hierarchy.
TREC-BIO includes 100 queries designed by biologists and the
candidate document pool is constructed based on the top results of
all submissions at that time. All candidate documents are labeled on
a 3-level scale. In these 100 queries, 86 of them are entity-set queries
and the maximum number of entities in a query is 11. The original
dataset contains no entity information and therefore we apply
PubTator [33], the state-of-the-art biomedical entity linking tool,
to obtain 5 types of entities (i.e., Gene, Disease, Chemical, Mutation,
and Species) in both queries and documents. We build a simple type
hierarchy with root node named ‘Thing’ and each first-level node
corresponds to one of the above 5 types.

5.2 Entity Linking Performance
We evaluate the query entity linking using precision and recall
at the query level. Specifically, an entity annotation is considered
correct if it appears in the gold labeled data (i.e., the strict evaluation
in [4]). The original S2-CS dataset provides such gold labeled data.
For TREC-BIO dataset, we asked two Master-level students with
biomedical science background to label all the linked entities as
well as the entities that they could identify in the queries. We also
report the entity linking performance on the general domain queries
(ClueWeb09 and ClueWeb12) for references [37]. As we can see
in Table 2, the overall linking performance of academic queries
is better than that of general domain queries, probably because
academic queries have less ambiguity. Also, recall of entity linking
in TREC-BIO dataset is very high. A possible reason is that the
biomedical entities have very distinctive tokens (e.g., “narcolepsy”
is a specific disease related to sleep and is seldom used in other
contexts) and thus it is relatively easier to recognize them.

5.3 Ranking Performance

5.3.1 Experimental Setup.

Evaluation metrics. Since documents in both datasets have multi-
level graded relevance, we use NDCG@{5,10,15,20} as our main
evaluation metrics. All evaluation is performed using standard
pytrec_eval tool [32]. Statistical significances are tested using two-
tailed t-test with p-value ≤ 0.05.
Baselines. We compare SetRank with 4 baseline ranking models:
Vector Space Model (BM25 [28]), Query Likelihood Model with

Dirichlet Prior smoothing (LM-DIR) or with Jelinek Mercer smooth-
ing (LM-JM) [41], and the Information-Based model (IB) [5]. All
models are applied to the paper’s title and abstract fields. Here, we
do not compete with Semantic Scholar’s production system and
ESR model [39] because they are supervised models trained over
user’s click information which is not available in our setting.

The parameters of all models, including the field weights, are set
using 5-fold cross validation over the queries in each benchmark
dataset using the same paradigm in [26] as follows. For each hold-
out fold, the other four folds are served as a validation set. A grid
search is applied to choose the optimal parameter settings that
maximize NDCG@20 on the validation set. Specifically, the title
and abstract field weights are selected from {1,5,10,15,20,50}; the
Dirichlet smoothing parameter µ and Jelinek Mercer smoothing
parameter λ are chosen from {500, 1000, 1500, 2000, 2500, 3000} and
{0.1, 0.2, . . . , 0.9}, respectively; the relative weight of entity token λE
used in SetRank is selected from {0, 0.1, . . . , 1}. The best performing
parameter settings are then saved for the hold-out evaluation.

5.3.2 Effectiveness of Leveraging Entity Information.
As mentioned before, the entity linking process is not perfect and
it generates some noisy entity annotations. Therefore, we first study
how different ranking models, including our proposed SetRank,
can leverage such noisy entity information to improve the ranking
performance. We evaluate three variations of each model – one
using only word information, one using only entity information,
and one using both pieces of information.

Results are shown in Table 3. We notice that the usefulness
of entity information is inconclusive for baseline models. On S2-
CS dataset, adding entity information can improve the ranking
performance, while on TREC-BIO dataset, it will drag down the
performance of all baseline methods. This resonates with previous
findings in [16] that simply adding entities into queries and post-
ing them to existing ranking models does not work for biomedical
literature retrieval. Compared with baseline methods, SetRank suc-
cessfully combines the word and entity information and effectively
leverages such noisy entity information to improve the ranking
performance. Furthermore, SetRank can better utilize each single
information source, either word or entity, than other baseline mod-
els thanks to our proposed query graph representation. Overall,
SetRank significantly outperforms all variations of baseline models.

5.3.3 Ranking Performance on Entity-Set Queries.
We further study each model’s ranking performance on entity-set
queries. There are 40 and 86 entity-set queries in S2-CS and TREC-
BIO, respectively. We denote these subsets of entity-set queries as
S2-CS-ESQ and TREC-BIO-ESQ. As shown in Table 4, SetRank sig-
nificantly outperforms the best variation of all baseline methods
on S2-CS-ESQ and TREC-BIO-ESQ by at least 25% and 14% respec-
tively in terms of NDCG@5. Also, we can see the advantages of
SetRank over the baselines on entity-set queries are larger than

those on general queries, This further demonstrates SetRank’s ef-
fectiveness of modeling entity set information.

5.3.4 Effectiveness of Modeling Entity Relation and Entity Type.
To study how the inter-entity relation and entity type informa-
tion can contribute to document ranking, we compare SetRank with
two of its variants, SetRank−t and SetRank−t s . The first variant
models entity relation among the set but ignores the entity type
information, and the second variant simply neglects both entity
relation and type.

Results are shown in Table 5. First, we compare SetRank−t with
SetRank−t s and find that modeling the entity relation in entity
sets can significantly improve the ranking results. Such improve-
ment is especially obvious on the entity-set query sets S2-CS-ESQ
and TREC-BIO-ESQ. Also, by comparing SetRank with SetRank−t ,
we can see adding entity type information can further improve
ranking performance. In addition, we present a concrete case study
for one entity-set query in Table 6. The top-2 papers returned by
SetRank−t s are focusing on video game without discussing its rela-
tion with reinforcement learning. In comparison, SetRank considers
the entity relations and returns the paper mentioning both entities.

5.3.5 Analysis of Entity Token Weight λE .
We introduce the entity token weight λE in Eq. (6) to combine
the entity-based and word-based relevance scores. In all previous
experiments, we choose its value using cross validation. Here, we
study how this parameter will influence the ranking performance
by constructing multiple SetRank models with different λE and
directly report their performance on all 100 queries.

As shown in Figure 4, for S2-CS dataset, SetRank’s ranking
performance first increases as λE increases until it reaches 0.7 and
then starts to decrease when we further increase λE . However, for
TREC-BIO dataset, the optimal value of λE is around 0.3, and if we
increases λE over 0.6, the ranking performance will drop quickly.

generates totally 7 × 4 × 4 × 4 × 4 = 1, 792 possible parameter
settings and for each of them we can construct a ranking model.
We first apply our unsupervised model selection algorithm (with
either KT or posKT as the ranking distance) and obtain the most
confident parameter settings returned by it. Then, we plug in these
parameter settings into SetRank and denote it as AutoSetRank. For
reference, we also calculate the average performance of all 1,792
ranking models.

set do perform better than the ones returned by our unsupervised
model selection algorithm, the difference is not significant. For
TREC-BIO dataset, it is surprising to find that AutoSetRank-posKT
can slightly outperforms SetRank tuned on validation set. Further-
more, the performance of AutoSetRank function is higher than the
average performances of all possible ranking models by 2 standard
deviations, which demonstrates the effectiveness of our unsuper-
vised model selection algorithm.

5.5 Use Case Study: Bio-Literature Search
In this section we demonstrate the effectiveness of SetRank in
a biomedical use case. As preparation, we build a biomedical lit-
erature search engine based on over 27 million papers retrieved
from PubMed. Entities in all papers are extracted and typed using
PubTator. This search system is cold-started with our proposed
SetRank model and we show how SetRank can help this search
system to accommodate a given entity-set query and returns a high-
quality rank list of papers relevant to the query. Comparison with
PubMed, a widely used search engine for biomedical literature, will
also be discussed.
A biomedical case. Consider the following case of a biomedical
information need. Genomics studies often identify sets of genes
as having important roles to play in the processes or conditions
under investigation, and the investigators seek to understand better
what biological insights such a list of genes might provide. Suppose
such a study, having examined brain gene expression patterns in
old mice, identifies ten genes as being of potential interest. The
investigator forms a query with these 10 genes, submits it to a
literature search engine, and examines the top ten returned papers
to look for an association between this gene set and a disease. The
query consists of symbols of the 10 genes: “APP, APOE, PSEN1,
SORL1, PSEN2, ACE, CLU, BDNF, IL1B, MAPT ”.
Relevance criterion. We choose the above ten genes for our il-
lustration because these are actually top genes associated with
Alzheimer’s disease according to DisGeNET [25], and it is unlikely
that there is another completely different (and unknown) common-
ality among them. Therefore, a retrieved paper is relevant if and
only if it discusses at least one of the query genes in the context of
Alzheimer’s disease. Furthermore, among all relevant papers, we
prefer those covering more unique genes.

Result analysis. The top-5 papers returned by PubMed4 and our
system are shown in Table 8. We see that the “Alzheimer’s disease” is
explicitly mentioned in the title of all the five papers returned by our
system, and the top two papers cover 6 unique genes among the total
10 genes. All five papers returned by SetRank are highly relevant,
since they all focus on the association between a subset of our
query genes and Alzheimer’s disease. In contrast, the top-5 papers
retrieved by PubMed are dominated by two genes (i.e., APOE4 and
BDNF) and contain none of the remaining eight. Only the 1st of the
five papers is highly relevant. It focuses on the association between
Alzheimer’s disease (mentioned explicitly in the title) and our query
gene set. Three other papers (ranked 2nd to 4th) are marginally
relevant, in the sense that Alzheimer’s disease is the context but
not the focus of their studies. The paper ranked 5th is irrelevant.
Therefore, users will prefer SetRank since it returns papers covering
a large-portion of an entity-set query and helps them to find the
association between this entity set with Alzheimer’s disease.

6 CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK
In this paper, we study the problem of searching scientific literature
using entity-set queries. A distinctive characteristic of entity-set
queries is that they reflect user’s interest in inter-entity relations. To
capture such information need, we propose SetRank, an unsuper-
vised ranking framework which explicitly models entity relations
among the entity set. Second, we develop a novel unsupervised
model selection algorithm based on weighted rank aggregation to
select SetRank’s parameters without relying on a labeled validation
set. Experimental results on two benchmark datasets corroborate
the effectiveness of SetRank and the usefulness of our model se-
lection algorithm. We further discuss the power of SetRankwith a
real-world use case of biomedical literature search.

As a future direction, we would like to explore how we can
go beyond pairwise entity relations and integrate higher-order
entity relations into the current SetRank framework. Besides, it
would be interesting to explore whether SetRank can effectively
model domain expert’s prior knowledge about the relative impor-
tance of entity relations. Furthermore, the incorporation of user

4Querying PubMed with the exact same query returns 0 document. To get reasonable results,
PubMed users have to insert an OR logic between every pairs of genes, and change the default
“sorting by most recent” to “sorting by best match”.
