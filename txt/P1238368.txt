Abstract. Along with the advance of opinion mining techniques, public
mood has been found to be a key element for stock market prediction.
However, how market participants’ behavior is aﬀected by public mood
has been rarely discussed. Consequently, there has been little progress
in leveraging public mood for the asset allocation problem, which is pre-
ferred in a trusted and interpretable way. In order to address the issue
of incorporating public mood analyzed from social media, we propose to
formalize public mood into market views, because market views can be
integrated into the modern portfolio theory. In our framework, the opti-
mal market views will maximize returns in each period with a Bayesian
asset allocation model. We train two neural models to generate the mar-
ket views, and benchmark the model performance on other popular asset
allocation strategies. Our experimental results suggest that the formal-
ization of market views signiﬁcantly increases the proﬁtability (5% to
10% annually) of the simulated portfolio at a given risk level.

Introduction

Sales and macroeconomic factors are some of the driving forces behind stock
movements but there are many others. For example, the subjective views of
market participants also have important eﬀects. Along with the growing popu-
larity of social media in the past decades, people tend to rapidly express and
exchange their thoughts and opinions [21]. As a result, the importance of their
views has dramatically risen [6]. Currently, stock movements are considered to
be essentially aﬀected by new information and the beliefs of investors [17].

Meanwhile, sentiment analysis has emerged as a new tool for analyzing the
opinions shared on social media [7]. It is a branch of aﬀective computing research
that aims to classify natural language utterances as either positive or negative,
but sometimes also neutral [9]. In the ﬁnancial domain, sentiment analysis is
frequently used to obtain a data stream of public mood toward a company,

stock, or the economy. Public mood is the aggregation of individual sentiments
which can be obtained and estimated from various sources, such as stock message
boards [2,19], blogs, newspapers, and really simple syndication (RSS) feeds [34].
Recently, Twitter has become a dominant microblogging platform on which
many works rely for their investigations, such as [27,23,20]. Many previous stud-
ies support the claim that public mood helps to predict the stock market. For
instance, the fuzzy neural network model considering public mood achieves high
directional accuracy in predicting the market index. The mood time series is
also proved a Granger cause of the market index [4]. Si et al. build a topic-based
sentiment time series and predict the market index better with a vector autore-
gression model to interactively link the two series [26]. The Hurst exponents also
suggest a long-term dependency for time series of mood extracted form ﬁnancial
news, similar to many market indices [8].

Despite the important role in stock market prediction, we assume that pub-
lic mood does not directly eﬀect the market: it does indirectly through market
participants’ views. The actions taken by market participants as agents, are de-
pendent on their own views, and their knowledge about other agents’ views. The
changes of asset prices are the consequences of such actions. These assumptions
are very diﬀerent from econometric research using productivity, equilibrium, and
business cycle models [1], but closer to agent-based models [14]. However, the
mechanism of how market views are formed from public mood is heavily over-
looked even in the latter case. An intuitive hypothesis could be: the happier
the public mood, the higher the stock price. In the real-world market, however,
this relationship is far more complicated. Therefore, existing superﬁcial ﬁnancial
applications of AI do not appear convincing to professionals.

In this paper, we attempt to ﬁll this gap by proposing a method for incor-
porating public mood to form market views computationally. To validate the
quality of our views, we simulate the trading performance with a constructed
portfolio. The key contributions of this paper can be summarized as follows:

1. We introduce a stricter and easier-to-compute deﬁnition of the market views
based on a Bayesian asset allocation model. We prove that our deﬁnition is
compatible, and has the equivalent expressiveness as the original form.
2. We propose a novel online optimization method to estimate the expected
returns by solving temporal maximization problem of portfolio returns.
3. Our experiments show that the portfolio performance with market views
blending public mood data stream is better than directly training a neural
trading model without views. This superiority is robust for diﬀerent models
selected with the right parameters to generate market views.

The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: Sect. 2 explains the concept
of Bayesian asset allocation; following, we describe the methodologies developed
for modeling market views in Sect. 3; we evaluate such methodologies by running
trading simulations with various experimental settings in Sect. 4 and show the
interpretability of our model with an example in Sect. 5; ﬁnally, Sect. 6 concludes
the paper and describes future work.

2 Bayesian Asset Allocation

The portfolio construction framework [18] has been a prevalent model for invest-
ment for more than half a century. Given the an amount of initial capital, the
investor will need to allocate it to diﬀerent assets. Based on the idea of trading-
oﬀ between asset returns and the risk taken by the investor, the mean-variance
method proposes the condition of an eﬃcient portfolio as follows [18,29]:

subject to

wi = 1, i = 1, 2, ..., N. wi ≥ 0.

where δ is an indicator of risk aversion, wi denotes the weight of the correspond-
ing asset in the portfolio, µi denotes the expected return of asset i, σij is the
covariance between returns of asset i and j. The optimized weights of an eﬃcient
portfolio is therefore given by the ﬁrst order condition of Eq. 1:

w∗ = (δΣ)−1µ

where Σ is the covariance matrix of asset returns and µ is a vector of expected
returns µi. At the risk level of holding w∗, the eﬃcient portfolio achieves the
maximum combinational expected return.

However, when applying this mean-variance approach in real-world cases,
many problems are faced. For example, the two moments of asset returns are
diﬃcult to estimate accurately [25], as they are non-stationary time series. The
situation is worsened by the fact that, the Markowitz model is very sensitive
to the estimated returns and volatility as inputs. The optimized weights can
be very diﬀerent because of a small error in µ or Σ. To address the limitation
of the Markowitz model, a Bayesian approach that integrates the additional
information of investor’s judgment and the market fundamentals was proposed
by Black and Litterman [3]. In the Black-Litterman model, the expected returns
µBL of a portfolio is inferred by two antecedents: the equilibrium risk premiums
Π of the market as calculated by the capital asset pricing model (CAPM), and
a set of views on the expected returns of the investor.

The Black-Litterman model assumes that the equilibrium returns are nor-
mally distributed as req ∼ N (Π, τ Σ), where Σ is the covariance matrix of asset
returns, τ is an indicator of the conﬁdence level of the CAPM estimation of Π.
The market views on the expected returns held by an investor agent are also
normally distributed as rviews ∼ N (Q, Ω).

Subsequently, the posterior distribution of the portfolio returns providing the
views is also Gaussian. If we denote this distribution by rBL ∼ N (¯µ, ¯Σ), then ¯µ
and ¯Σ will be a function of the aforementioned variables (see Fig. 1).

(cid:2)¯µ, ¯Σ(cid:3) = f (τ, Σ, Ω, Π, Q)

model, which has a mean between two prior
distributions and a variance less than both

The function can be induced from applying Bayes’ theorem on the probability

density function of the posterior expected returns:

Then, the optimized Bayesian portfolio weights have a similar form to Eq. 2,
only substituting Σ and µ by ¯Σ and ¯µ:

pdf (¯µ) =

pdf (¯µ|Π) pdf (Π)
pdf (Π|¯µ)

BL = (δ ¯Σ)−1 ¯µ.

The most common criticism of the Black-Litterman model is the subjectivity
of investor’s views. In other words, the model resorts to the good quality of
the market views, while it leaves the question of how to actually form these
views unanswered. In Sect. 3, we will investigate the possibility of automatically
formalizing the market views from public mood distilled from the Web and the
maximization of portfolio returns for each time period.

3 Methodologies

3.1 Modeling Market Views

The Black-Litterman model deﬁnes a view as a statement that the expected re-
turn of a portfolio has a normal distribution with mean equal to q and a standard
deviation given by ω. This hypothetical portfolio is called a view portfolio [13].
In practice, there are two intuitive types of views on the market, termed relative
views and absolute views, that we are especially interested in. Next, we introduce
the formalization of these two types of views.

Because the standard deviation ω can be interpreted as the conﬁdence of
expected return of the view portfolio, a relative view takes the form of “I have
ω1 conﬁdence that asset x will outperform asset y by a% (in terms of expected
return)”; an absolute view takes the form of “I have ω2 conﬁdence that asset z will
outperform the (whole) market by b%”. Consequently, for a portfolio consisting
of n assets, a set of k views can be represented by three matrices Pk,n, Qk,1, and
Ωk,k.

Discovering Bayesian Market Views

Pk,n indicates the assets mentioned in views. The sum of each row of Pk,n
should either be 0 (for relative views) or 1 (for absolute views); Qk,1 is a vector
comprises expected returns for each view. Mathematically, the conﬁdence matrix
Ωk,k is a measure of covariance between the views. The Black-Litterman model
assumes that the views are independent of each other, so the conﬁdence matrix
can be written as Ω = diag(ω1, ω2, ..., ωn). In fact, this assumption will not aﬀect
the expressiveness of the views as long as the k views are compatible (not self-
contradictory). Because when Ωk,k is not diagonal, we can always do spectral
decomposition: Ω = V ΩΛV −1. Then we write the new mentioning and new
expected return matrices as P Λ = V −1P , QΛ = V −1Q, where ΩΛ is diagonal.
Under these constructions, we introduce two important properties of the view
matrices in Theorem 1 and Theorem 2.

Theorem 1 (Compatibility of Independent Views). Any set of indepen-
dent views are compatible.

Proof. Compatible views refer to views that can hold at the same time. For
example, {asset x will outperform asset y by 3%, asset y will outperform asset
z by 5%, asset x will outperform asset z by 8%} is compatible. However, if we
change the third piece of view to “asset z will outperform asset x by 8%”, the
view set becomes self-contradictory. Because the third piece of view is actually
a deduction from the former two, the view set is called “not independent”.

Assume there is a pair of incompatible views {p, q} and {p, q(cid:48)}, q (cid:54)= q(cid:48). Both
views are either explicitly stated or can be derived from a set of k views. Hence,
there exist two diﬀerent linear combinations, such that:

where (ai − bi) are not all zeros.

k
(cid:80)
i=1

Thus, we have

(ai −bi)pi = 0, which means that matrix P is rank deﬁcient

and the k views are not independent. According to the law of contrapositive, the
(cid:117)(cid:116)
statement “all independent view sets are compatible” is true.

Theorem 2 (Universality of Absolute View Matrix). Any set of indepen-
dent relative and absolute views can be expressed with a non-singular absolute
view matrix.

Proof. Assume a matrix P with r relative views and (k − r) absolute views.

The corresponding return vector is Q = (q1, q2, . . . , qk), the capital weight
vector for assets is w = (w1, w2, . . . , wk). Hence, we can write (r + 1) equations

According to Cramer’s rule, there exists a unique solution Q(cid:48) = (q(cid:48)

1, q(cid:48)

Now, P (cid:48)

k,n only consists of absolute views. By deleting those dependent views,
we can have a non-singular matrix that only consists of absolute views and is
(cid:117)(cid:116)
compatible.

Given Theorem 1 and Theorem 2, without loss of generality, we can use the fol-
lowing equivalent yet stricter deﬁnition of market views to reduce computational
complexity.

Deﬁnition 1. Market views on n assets can be represented by three matrices
Pn,n, Qn,1, and Ωn,n, where Pn,n is an identity matrix; Qn,1 ∈ Rn; Ωn,n is a
nonnegative diagonal matrix.

3.2 The Conﬁdence Matrix

In the most original form of the Black-Litterman model, the conﬁdence matrix
Ω is set manually according to investors’ experience. Whereas in the numerical
example given by [13], the conﬁdence matrix is derived from the equilibrium
covariance matrix:

ˆΩ0 = diag(P (τ Σ)P (cid:48))
(8)
This is because P (τ Σ)P (cid:48) can be understood as a covariance matrix of the ex-
pected returns in the views as well. Using our deﬁnition, it is easier to understand
this estimation, because P is an identity matrix, P (τ Σ)P (cid:48) is already diagonal.
The underlying assumption is that the variance of an absolute view on asset i is
proportional to the volatility of asset i. In this case, the estimation of Ω utilizes
past information of asset price volatilities.

3.3 Optimal Market Views

We obtain the optimal market views {P, Q, Ω} in a hybrid way, ﬁrst we adopt
the conﬁdence matrix ˆΩ0, then Q can be derived from the inverse optimization
problem using the Black-Litterman model.

We start from the optimal portfolio weights that maximize the portfolio
returns for each period t. Obviously, without short selling and transaction fees,
one should re-invest his whole capital daily to the fastest-growing asset in the
next time period.

The optimal holding weights for each time period t thus take the form of a

one-hot vector, where (cid:11) and (cid:12) denote element-wise division and product:

where the Black-Litterman model gives3:

3.4 Generating Market Views with Neural Models

Eq. 13 provides a theoretical perspective on determining the expected return of
optimal market views. However, computing w∗
t requires future asset prices, which
is not accessible. Therefore, the feasible approach is to learn approximating Q∗
t
with historical data and other priors as input. We use the time series of asset
prices, trading volumes, and public mood data stream to train neural models
(nn) for this approximation problem of optimal market views:

ˆQt = nn(prices, volumes, sentiments; Q∗
t )

(14)

We denote the time series of asset prices pricet−k, pricet−k+1, ..., pricet by a
lag operator L0∼kpricet. The notation of trading volumes follows a similar form.

3 The proof of Eq. 11 and 12 can be found from the appendix of [24].

8

F. Xing et al.

Then the model input at each time point: [L0∼kpricet, L0∼kvolumet, sentimentt,
capitalt] can be denoted by [p, v, s, c]t in short.

Two types of neural models, including a neural-fuzzy approach and a deep
learning approach are trained for comparison. Fig. 2 provides an illustration of
the online training process using a long short-term memory (LSTM) network,
where ˆQ is the output.

Fig. 2. Model training process (LSTM) with/without sentiment information.

Dynamic evolving neural-fuzzy inference system (DENFIS) is a neural
network model with fuzzy rule nodes [16]. The partitioning of which rule nodes
to be activated is dynamically updated with the new distribution of incoming
data. This evolving clustering method (ECM) features the model with stability
and fast adaptability. Comparing to many other fuzzy neural networks, DENFIS
performs better in modeling nonlinear complex systems [32].

Considering the ﬁnancial market as a real-world complex system, we learn
the ﬁrst-order Takagi-Sugeno-Kang type rules online. Each rule node has the
form of:

IF L0∼kattributet,i = patterni, i = 1, 2, ..., N

THEN ˆQt = f1,2,...,N ([p, v, s]t)

where we have 3 attributes and (2N − 1) candidate functions to activate. In
our implementation of the DENFIS model, all the membership functions are
symmetrical and triangular, which can be deﬁned by two parameters b ± d/2.
b is where the membership degree equals to 1; d is the activation range of the

9

fuzzy rule. In our implementation, b is iteratively updated by linear least-square
estimator of existing consequent function coeﬃcients.

LSTM is a type of recurrent neural network with gated units. This unit archi-
tecture is claimed to be well-suited for learning to predict time series with an
unknown size of lags and long-term event dependencies. Early attempts, though
not very successful [11], have been made to apply LSTM to time series predic-
tion. It is now recognized that though LSTM cells can have many variants, their
performance across diﬀerent tasks are similar [12].

Therefore, we use a vanilla LSTM unit structure. Our implementation of
LSTM cells follows the update rules of the input gate, forget gate, and output
gate as in Eq. 15:

it = σ(Wi · [ ht−1, [p, v, s]t ] + bi)
ft = σ(Wf · [ ht−1, [p, v, s]t ] + bf )
ot = σ(Wo · [ ht−1, [p, v, s]t ] + bo)

where σ denotes the sigmoid function, ht−1 is the output of the previous state,
W is a state transfer matrix, and b is the bias.

The state of each LSTM cell ct is updated by:

ct = ft (cid:12) ct−1 + it (cid:12) (Wc · [ ht−1, [p, v, s]t ] + bc)
ht−1 = ot (cid:12) tanh(ct−1)

We make the training process online as well, in a sense that each time a
new input is received, we use the previous states and parameters of LSTM cells
[ct−1, W, b] to initialize the LSTM cells for period t.

(15)

(16)

To evaluate the quality and eﬀectiveness of our formalization of market views,
we run trading simulations with various experimental settings.

4 Experiments

4.1 Data

The data used in this study are publicly available on the Web4. We obtain the
historical closing price of stocks and daily trading volumes from the Quandl
API5; the market capitalization data from Yahoo! Finance; the daily count and
intensity of company-level sentiment time series from PsychSignal6. The senti-
ment intensity scores are computed from multiple social media platforms using
NLP techniques. Fig. 3 depicts a segment example of the public mood data

stream. The market is closed on weekends, so a corresponding weekly cycle of
message volume can be observed.

We investigate a window of around 8 years (2800 days). All the time series are
trimmed from 2009-10-05 to 2017-06-04. For missing values such as the closing
prices on weekends and public holidays, we ﬁll them with the nearest historical
data to train the neural models. The lagged values we use for both price and
trading volume consist of 4 previous days and a moving average of the past 30
days, that is, the input of our neural models takes the form of Eq. 17 and 18:

4.2 Trading Simulation

We construct a virtual portfolio consisting of 5 big-cap stocks: Apple Inc (AAPL),
Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS), Pﬁzer Inc (PFE), Newmont Mining Corp (NEM),
and Starbucks Corp (SBUX). This random selection covers both the NYSE and
NASDAQ markets and diversiﬁed industries, such as technology, ﬁnancial ser-
vices, health care, consumer discretionary etc. During the period investigated,
there were two splits: a 7-for-1 split for AAPL on June 9th 2014, and a 2-for-1 split
for SBUX on April 9th 2015. The prices per share are adjusted according to the
current share size for computing all related variables, however, dividends are not
taken into account. We benchmark our results with two portfolio construction
strategies:

1) The value-weighted portfolio (VW): we re-invest daily according
to the percentage share of each stock’s market capitalization. In this case, the
portfolio performance will be the weighted average of each stock’s performance.
This strategy is fundamental, yet empirical study [10] shows that beating the
market even before netting out fees is diﬃcult.

dent from timespan, accordingly the two neural models are compared in 4(d) and 4(e)
respectively for better presentation.

2) The neural trading portfolio (NT): we remove the construction of
market views and directly train the optimal weights of daily position with the
same input. For this black-box strategy, we can not get any insight on how this
output portfolio weight comes about.

In the simulations, we assume no short selling, taxes, or transaction fees, and
we assume the portfolio investments are inﬁnitely divisible, starting from 10, 000
dollars. We construct portfolios with no views (Ω∅, in this case the degenerate
portfolio is equivalent to Markowitz’s mean-variance portfolio using historical
return series to estimate covariance matrix as a measure of risk), random views
(Ωr), the standard views using the construction of Black-Litterman model (Ω0),
with and without our sentiment-induced expected returns (s). The trading per-
formances are demonstrated in Fig. 4.

Following the previous research [13], we set the risk aversion coeﬃcient
δ = 0.25 and conﬁdence level of CAPM, τ = 0.05. Let the activation range
of fuzzy membership function d = 0.21, we obtain 21 fuzzy rule nodes from the
whole online training process of DENFIS. This parameter minimizes the global
portfolio weight error. For the second neural model using deep learning, we stack
two layers of LSTMs followed by a densely connected layer. Each LSTM layer
has 3 units; the densely connected layer has 50 neurons, which is set times larger
than the number of LSTM units. We use the mean squared error of vector Q as

12

the loss function and the rmsprop optimizer [30] to train this architecture. We
observe fast training error convergence in our experiments.

4.3 Performance Metrics

Diversiﬁed metrics have been proposed to evaluate the performance of a given
portfolio [5,15,31]. We report four metrics in our experiments.

Root mean square error (RMSE) is a universal metric for approximation
problems. It is widely used for engineering and data with normal distribution
and few outliers. We calculate the RMSE of our realized portfolio weights to the
optimal weights:

RMSE =

Annualized return (AR) measures the proﬁtability of a given portfolio. We
calculate the geometric mean growth rate per year, which is also referred to as
compound annual growth rate (CAGR) for these 2800 days.

Sharpe ratio (SR) is a risk-adjusted return measure. We choose the value-

weighted portfolio as a base, consequently the Sharpe ratio of VW will be 1:

SR =

E(Rportf olio/RV W )
σ(Rportf olio)/σ(RV W )

SR uses the standard deviation of daily returns as the measure of risk. Note that
to distinguish between good and bad risk, we can also use the standard deviation
of downside returns only [28]. Our results suggest that the Sortino ratios, which
are not reported due to page limit, are very close to SRs and lead to the same
conclusion.

The maximum drawdown (MDD) measures the maximum possible percent-

age loss of an investor:

MDD = max
0<t<τ

(cid:110) V aluet − V alueτ
V aluet

(cid:111)

Asset allocation strategies with large MDD are exposed to the risk of withdrawal.
Table 1 presents the metrics.

4.4 Findings

We have some interesting observations from Fig. 4 and Table 1. SR and AR
are usually considered as the most important, and besides, RMSE and MDD
are all very close in our experiments. The correlation between RMSE and the
other three metrics is weak, though it is intuitive that if the realized weights
are close to the optimal weights, the portfolio performance should be better.
On the contrary, the LSTM models seem to overﬁt as they are trained on the
mean squared error of weights or expected return of views [22]. However, as

mentioned in Sect. 1, the relationship between weights and daily returns is non-
linear. Therefore, holding portfolio weights that are close to the optimal weights
does not necessarily means that the AR must be higher. In fact, it is dangerous
to use any seemingly reasonable metrics outside the study of asset allocation,
such as directional accuracy of price change prediction [4,33], to evaluate the
expected portfolio performance.

The Markowitz portfolio (Ω∅) displays a very similar behavior to the market-
following strategy. This is consistent with the ineﬃcacy of the mean-variance ap-
proach in practice mentioned by previous studies: holding the Markowitz port-
folio is holding the market portfolio. In fact, if the CAPM holds, the market
portfolio already reﬂects the adjustments to risk premiums, that is, fewer mar-
ket participants will invest on highly risky assets, for this reason their market
capitalization will be smaller as well.

However, the Black-Litterman model does not always guarantee better per-
formance over the Markowitz portfolio. “Garbage in, garbage out” still holds
for this circumstance. Given random views (Ωr), it can be worse than market-
following in terms of both SR and AR. The lesson learned is that if the investor
knows nothing, it is better to hold no views and follow the market than pretending
to know something.

In our experiments, DENFIS generally performs better than LSTM models,
achieving higher SRs and ARs. The reason may be LSTM models adapt faster to
the incoming data, whereas ﬁnancial time series are usually very noisy. The ECM
mechanism provides DENFIS models with converging learning rates, which may
be beneﬁcial to the stability of memorized rules. However, it is important to note
that the ARs for both neural models improve with the blending of sentiments.
The timespan used to estimate correlation and volatility of assets seems not
that critical. DENFIS models perform better with longer timespan, while LSTM

models perform better with shorter timespan. The Markowitz portfolio is less
aﬀected by timespan.

5 A Story

One of the main advantages of our formalization and computing of market views
is that some transparency is brought to the daily asset reallocation decisions.
In most cases, a stock price prediction system based on machine learning algo-
rithms cannot justify “why he thinks that price will reach that predicted point”.
Unlike these systems, our method can tell a story of the portfolio to professional
investors and advice seekers. Take June 1st 2017 as an example:

“On June 1st 2017, we observe 164 positive opinions of polarity +1.90, 58
negative opinions of polarity −1.77 on AAPL stock; 54 positive opinions of polar-
ity +1.77, 37 negative opinions of polarity −1.53 on GS stock; 5 positive opinions
of polarity +2.46, 1 negative opinion of polarity −1.33 on PFE stock; no opinion
on NEM stock; and 9 positive opinions of polarity +1.76, 5 negative opinions of
polarity −2.00 on SBUX stock. Given the historical prices and trading volumes
of the stocks, we have 6.29% conﬁdence that AAPL will outperform the market
by −70.11%; 23.50% conﬁdence that GS will outperform the market by 263.28%;
0.11% conﬁdence that PFE will outperform the market by −0.50%; 1.21% conﬁ-
dence that SBUX will outperform the market by 4.57%. Since our current portfolio
invests 21.56% on AAPL, 25.97% on GS, 29.43% on PFE, and 23.04% on SBUX, by
June 2nd 2017, we should withdraw all the investment on AAPL, 2.76% of the in-
vestment on GS, 81.58% of the investment on PFE, and 30.77% of the investment
on SBUX, and re-invest them onto NEM.”

6 Conclusion and Future Work

In previous studies which have considered sentiment information for ﬁnancial
forecasting, the role of the investor as a market participant is often absent. In
this paper, we present a novel approach to incorporate market sentiment by
fusing public mood data stream into the Bayesian asset allocation framework.

This work is pioneering in formalizing sentiment-induced market views. Our
experiments show that the market views provide a powerful method to asset
management. We also conﬁrm the eﬃcacy of public mood data stream based on
social media for developing asset allocation strategies.

A limitation of this work is that we ﬁxed a portfolio with ﬁve assets, though
in practice the portfolio selection problem is of equal importance. How to assess
the quality of sentiment data is not discussed in this paper as well. We are not at
the stage to distinguish or detect opinion manipulation though concern like the
open networks are rife with bots does exist. Another limitation is that survivor
bias is not taken into account: the risk that assets selected in the portfolio may
quit the market or suﬀer from a lack of liquidity. This problem can be alleviated
by only including high quality assets. In the future, we will study examining the

quality of sentiment data obtained using diﬀerent content analysis approaches.
We also plan to develop a Bayesian asset allocation model that can deal with
market frictions.
