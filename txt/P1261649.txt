Abstract

Reasoning and inference are central to hu-
man and artiﬁcial intelligence. Modeling
inference in human language is very chal-
lenging. With the availability of large an-
notated data (Bowman et al., 2015), it has
recently become feasible to train neural
network based inference models, which
have shown to be very effective. In this
paper, we present a new state-of-the-art re-
sult, achieving the accuracy of 88.6% on
the Stanford Natural Language Inference
Dataset. Unlike the previous top models
that use very complicated network architec-
tures, we ﬁrst demonstrate that carefully de-
signing sequential inference models based
on chain LSTMs can outperform all previ-
ous models. Based on this, we further show
that by explicitly considering recursive ar-
chitectures in both local inference model-
ing and inference composition, we achieve
additional improvement. Particularly, in-
corporating syntactic parsing information
contributes to our best result—it further im-
proves the performance even when added
to the already very strong model.

Introduction

Reasoning and inference are central to both human
and artiﬁcial intelligence. Modeling inference in
human language is notoriously challenging but is
a basic problem towards true natural language un-
derstanding, as pointed out by MacCartney and
Manning (2008), “a necessary (if not sufﬁcient)

condition for true natural language understanding
is a mastery of open-domain natural language in-
ference.” The previous work has included extensive
research on recognizing textual entailment.

Speciﬁcally, natural language inference (NLI)
is concerned with determining whether a natural-
language hypothesis h can be inferred from a
premise p, as depicted in the following example
from MacCartney (2009), where the hypothesis is
regarded to be entailed from the premise.

p: Several airlines polled saw costs grow more than
expected, even after adjusting for inﬂation.

h: Some of the companies in the poll reported cost

increases.

The most recent years have seen advances in
modeling natural language inference. An impor-
tant contribution is the creation of a much larger
annotated dataset, the Stanford Natural Language
Inference (SNLI) dataset (Bowman et al., 2015).
The corpus has 570,000 human-written English
sentence pairs manually labeled by multiple human
subjects. This makes it feasible to train more com-
plex inference models. Neural network models,
which often need relatively large annotated data to
estimate their parameters, have shown to achieve
the state of the art on SNLI (Bowman et al., 2015,
2016; Munkhdalai and Yu, 2016b; Parikh et al.,
2016; Sha et al., 2016; Paria et al., 2016).

While some previous top-performing models use
rather complicated network architectures to achieve
the state-of-the-art results (Munkhdalai and Yu,
2016b), we demonstrate in this paper that enhanc-
ing sequential inference models based on chain

models can outperform all previous results, sug-
gesting that the potentials of such sequential in-
ference approaches have not been fully exploited
yet. More speciﬁcally, we show that our sequential
inference model achieves an accuracy of 88.0% on
the SNLI benchmark.

Exploring syntax for NLI is very attractive to us.
In many problems, syntax and semantics interact
closely, including in semantic composition (Partee,
1995), among others. Complicated tasks such as
natural language inference could well involve both,
which has been discussed in the context of rec-
ognizing textual entailment (RTE) (Mehdad et al.,
2010; Ferrone and Zanzotto, 2014).
In this pa-
per, we are interested in exploring this within the
neural network frameworks, with the presence of
relatively large training data. We show that by
explicitly encoding parsing information with re-
cursive networks in both local inference modeling
and inference composition and by incorporating
it into our framework, we achieve additional im-
provement, increasing the performance to a new
state of the art with an 88.6% accuracy.

2 Related Work

Early work on natural language inference has been
performed on rather small datasets with more con-
ventional methods (refer to MacCartney (2009)
for a good literature survey), which includes a
large bulk of work on recognizing textual entail-
ment, such as (Dagan et al., 2005; Iftene and
Balahur-Dobrescu, 2007), among others. More
recently, Bowman et al. (2015) made available the
SNLI dataset with 570,000 human annotated sen-
tence pairs. They also experimented with simple
classiﬁcation models as well as simple neural net-
works that encode the premise and hypothesis in-
dependently. Rocktäschel et al. (2015) proposed
neural attention-based models for NLI, which cap-
tured the attention information. In general, atten-
tion based models have been shown to be effec-
tive in a wide range of tasks, including machine
translation (Bahdanau et al., 2014), speech recogni-
tion (Chorowski et al., 2015; Chan et al., 2016), im-
age caption (Xu et al., 2015), and text summariza-
tion (Rush et al., 2015; Chen et al., 2016), among
others. For NLI, the idea allows neural models to
pay attention to speciﬁc areas of the sentences.

A variety of more advanced networks have been
developed since then (Bowman et al., 2016; Ven-
drov et al., 2015; Mou et al., 2016; Liu et al., 2016;

Munkhdalai and Yu, 2016a; Rocktäschel et al.,
2015; Wang and Jiang, 2016; Cheng et al., 2016;
Parikh et al., 2016; Munkhdalai and Yu, 2016b;
Sha et al., 2016; Paria et al., 2016). Among them,
more relevant to ours are the approaches proposed
by Parikh et al. (2016) and Munkhdalai and Yu
(2016b), which are among the best performing mod-
els.

Parikh et al. (2016) propose a relatively sim-
ple but very effective decomposable model. The
model decomposes the NLI problem into subprob-
lems that can be solved separately. On the other
hand, Munkhdalai and Yu (2016b) propose much
more complicated networks that consider sequen-
tial LSTM-based encoding, recursive networks,
and complicated combinations of attention mod-
els, which provide about 0.5% gain over the results
reported by Parikh et al. (2016).

It is, however, not very clear if the potential of
the sequential inference networks has been well
exploited for NLI. In this paper, we ﬁrst revisit this
problem and show that enhancing sequential infer-
ence models based on chain networks can actually
outperform all previous results. We further show
that explicitly considering recursive architectures
to encode syntactic parsing information for NLI
could further improve the performance.

3 Hybrid Neural Inference Models

We present here our natural language inference net-
works which are composed of the following major
components: input encoding, local inference mod-
eling, and inference composition. Figure 1 shows a
high-level view of the architecture. Vertically, the
ﬁgure depicts the three major components, and hor-
izontally, the left side of the ﬁgure represents our
sequential NLI model named ESIM, and the right
side represents networks that incorporate syntactic
parsing information in tree LSTMs.

In our notation, we have two sentences a =
(a1, . . . , a(cid:96)a) and b = (b1, . . . , b(cid:96)b), where a is a
Rl is
premise and b a hypothesis. The ai or bj
an embedding of l-dimensional vector, which can
be initialized with some pre-trained word embed-
dings and organized with parse trees. The goal is to
predict a label y that indicates the logic relationship
between a and b.

3.1

Input Encoding

We employ bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM) as one
of our basic building blocks for NLI. We ﬁrst use it

generated by these two LSTMs at each time step
are concatenated to represent that time step and
its context. Note that we used LSTM memory
blocks in our models. We examined other recurrent
memory blocks such as GRUs (Gated Recurrent
Units) (Cho et al., 2014) and they are inferior to
LSTMs on the heldout set for our NLI task.

As discussed above, it is intriguing to explore
the effectiveness of syntax for natural language
inference; for example, whether it is useful even
when incorporated into the best-performing models.
To this end, we will also encode syntactic parse
trees of a premise and hypothesis through tree-
LSTM (Zhu et al., 2015; Tai et al., 2015; Le and
Zuidema, 2015), which extends the chain LSTM to
a recursive network (Socher et al., 2011).

Speciﬁcally, given the parse of a premise or hy-
pothesis, a tree node is deployed with a tree-LSTM
memory block depicted as in Figure 2 and com-
puted with Equations (3–10). In short, at each node,
an input vector xt and the hidden vectors of its two
children (the left child hL
t−1) are
taken in as the input to calculate the current node’s
hidden vector ht.

t−1 and the right hR

Figure 2: A tree-LSTM memory block.

We describe the updating of a node at a high level
with Equation (3) to facilitate references later in the
paper, and the detailed computation is described
in (4–10). Speciﬁcally, the input of a node is used
to conﬁgure four gates: the input gate it, output
gate ot, and the two forget gates f L
t . The
memory cell ct considers each child’s cell vector,
t−1 and cR

to encode the input premise and hypothesis (Equa-
tion (1) and (2)). Here BiLSTM learns to represent
a word (e.g., ai) and its context. Later we will also
use BiLSTM to perform inference composition to
construct the ﬁnal prediction, where BiLSTM en-
codes local inference information and its interac-
tion. To bookkeep the notations for later use, we
write as ¯ai the hidden (output) state generated by
the BiLSTM at time i over the input sequence a.
The same is applied to ¯bj:

Due to the space limit, we will skip the descrip-

Brieﬂy, when modeling a sequence, an LSTM em-
ploys a set of soft gates together with a memory
cell to control message ﬂows, resulting in an effec-
tive modeling of tracking long-distance informa-
tion/dependencies in a sequence.

In the current input encoding layer, xt is used to
encode a word embedding for a leaf node. Since
a non-leaf node does not correspond to a speciﬁc
word, we use a special vector x(cid:48)
t as its input, which
is like an unknown word. However, in the inference
composition layer that we discuss later, the goal
of using tree-LSTM is very different; the input xt
will be very different as well—it will encode local
inference information and will have values at all
tree nodes.

3.2 Local Inference Modeling

Modeling local subsentential inference between a
premise and hypothesis is the basic component for
determining the overall inference between these
two statements. To closely examine local infer-
ence, we explore both the sequential and syntactic
tree models that have been discussed above. The
former helps collect local inference for words and
their context, and the tree LSTM helps collect lo-
cal information between (linguistic) phrases and
clauses.

Locality of inference Modeling local inference
needs to employ some forms of hard or soft align-
ment to associate the relevant subcomponents be-
tween a premise and a hypothesis. This includes
early methods motivated from the alignment in
conventional automatic machine translation (Mac-
Cartney, 2009). In neural network models, this is
often achieved with soft attention.

Parikh et al. (2016) decomposed this process:
the word sequence of the premise (or hypothesis)
is regarded as a bag-of-word embedding vector
and inter-sentence “alignment” (or attention) is
computed individually to softly align each word

to the content of hypothesis (or premise, respec-
tively). While their basic framework is very effec-
tive, achieving one of the previous best results, us-
ing a pre-trained word embedding by itself does not
automatically consider the context around a word
in NLI. Parikh et al. (2016) did take into account
the word order and context information through an
optional distance-sensitive intra-sentence attention.
In this paper, we argue for leveraging attention
over the bidirectional sequential encoding of the
input, as discussed above. We will show that this
plays an important role in achieving our best results,
and the intra-sentence attention used by Parikh et al.
(2016) actually does not further improve over our
model, while the overall framework they proposed
is very effective.

Our soft alignment layer computes the attention
weights as the similarity of a hidden state tuple
<¯ai, ¯bj> between a premise and a hypothesis with
Equation (11). We did study more complicated
relationships between ¯ai and ¯bj with multilayer
perceptrons, but observed no further improvement
on the heldout data.

eij = ¯aT
i

¯bj.

(11)

In the formula, ¯ai and ¯bj are computed earlier
in Equations (1) and (2), or with Equation (3) when
tree-LSTM is used. Again, as discussed above, we
will use bidirectional LSTM and tree-LSTM to en-
code the premise and hypothesis, respectively. In
our sequential inference model, unlike in Parikh
et al. (2016) which proposed to use a function
F (¯ai), i.e., a feedforward neural network, to map
the original word representation for calculating eij,
we instead advocate to use BiLSTM, which en-
codes the information in premise and hypothesis
very well and achieves better performance shown in
the experiment section. We tried to apply the F (.)
function on our hidden states before computing eij
and it did not further help our models.

Local inference collected over sequences Lo-
cal inference is determined by the attention weight
eij computed above, which is used to obtain the
local relevance between a premise and hypothesis.
For the hidden state of a word in a premise, i.e., ¯ai
(already encoding the word itself and its context),
the relevant semantics in the hypothesis is iden-
tiﬁed and composed using eij, more speciﬁcally

with Equation (12).

˜ai =

˜bj =

also further modeled the interaction by feeding the
tuples into feedforward neural networks and added
the top layer hidden states to the above concate-
nation. We found that it does not further help the
inference accuracy on the heldout dataset.

}

Local inference collected over parse trees We
use tree models to help collect local inference in-
formation over linguistic phrases and clauses in
this layer. The tree structures of the premise and
hypothesis are produced by a constituency parser.
Once the hidden states of a tree are all computed
with Equation (3), we treat all tree nodes equally
as we do not have further heuristics to discrimi-
nate them, but leave the attention weights to ﬁgure
out their relationship. So, we use Equation (11)
to compute the attention weights for all node pairs
between a premise and hypothesis. This connects
all words, constituent phrases, and clauses between
the premise and hypothesis. We then collect the in-
formation between all the pairs with Equations (12)
and (13) and feed them into the next layer.

inference information
Enhancement of local
In our models, we further enhance the local in-
ference information collected. We compute the
difference and the element-wise product for the tu-
ple <¯a, ˜a> as well as for <¯b, ˜b>. We expect that
such operations could help sharpen local inference
information between elements in the tuples and cap-
ture inference relationships such as contradiction.
The difference and element-wise product are then
concatenated with the original vectors, ¯a and ˜a,
or ¯b and ˜b, respectively (Mou et al., 2016; Zhang
et al., 2017). The enhancement is performed for
both the sequential and the tree models.

(15)

This process could be regarded as a special case
of modeling some high-order interaction between
the tuple elements. Along this direction, we have

To determine the overall inference relationship be-
tween a premise and hypothesis, we explore a com-
position layer to compose the enhanced local in-
ference information ma and mb. We perform the
composition sequentially or in its parse context
using BiLSTM and tree-LSTM, respectively.

The composition layer
In our sequential infer-
ence model, we keep using BiLSTM to compose
local inference information sequentially. The for-
mulas for BiLSTM are similar to those in Equations
(1) and (2) in their forms so we skip the details, but
the aim is very different here—they are used to cap-
ture local inference information ma and mb and
their context here for inference composition.

In the tree composition, the high-level formulas
of how a tree node is updated to compose local
inference is as follows:

1, hR
va,t = TrLSTM(F (ma,t), hL
1),
t
t
−
−
1, hR
vb,t = TrLSTM(F (mb,t), hL
1).

−

(16)

(17)

We propose to control model complexity in this
layer, since the concatenation we described above
to compute ma and mb can signiﬁcantly increase
the overall parameter size to potentially overﬁt the
models. We propose to use a mapping F as in
Equation (16) and (17). More speciﬁcally, we use a
1-layer feedforward neural network with the ReLU
activation. This function is also applied to BiLSTM
in our sequential inference composition.

Pooling Our inference model converts the result-
ing vectors obtained above to a ﬁxed-length vector
with pooling and feeds it to the ﬁnal classiﬁer to
determine the overall inference relationship.

We consider that summation (Parikh et al., 2016)
could be sensitive to the sequence length and hence
less robust. We instead suggest the following strat-
egy: compute both average and max pooling, and
concatenate all these vectors to form the ﬁnal ﬁxed
length vector v. Our experiments show that this
leads to signiﬁcantly better results than summa-
tion. The ﬁnal ﬁxed length vector v is calculated

as follows:

va,ave =

vb,ave =

(cid:96)a(cid:88)

i=1

(cid:96)b(cid:88)

j=1

(cid:96)bmax
j=1

vb,j,

(18)

(19)

v = [va,ave; va,max; vb,ave; vb,max].

(20)

Note that for tree composition, Equation (20)
is slightly different from that in sequential com-
position. Our tree composition will concatenate
also the hidden states computed for the roots with
Equations (16) and (17), which are not shown here.
We then put v into a ﬁnal multilayer perceptron
(MLP) classiﬁer. The MLP has a hidden layer with
tanh activation and softmax output layer in our ex-
periments. The entire model (all three components
described above) is trained end-to-end. For train-
ing, we use multi-class cross-entropy loss.

Overall inference models Our model can be
based only on the sequential networks by removing
all tree components and we call it Enhanced Se-
quential Inference Model (ESIM) (see the left part
of Figure 1). We will show that ESIM outperforms
all previous results. We will also encode parse in-
formation with tree LSTMs in multiple layers as
described (see the right side of Figure 1). We train
this model and incorporate it into ESIM by averag-
ing the predicted probabilities to get the ﬁnal label
for a premise-hypothesis pair. We will show that
parsing information complements very well with
ESIM and further improves the performance, and
we call the ﬁnal model Hybrid Inference Model
(HIM).

4 Experimental Setup

Data The Stanford Natural Language Inference
(SNLI) corpus (Bowman et al., 2015) focuses on
three basic relationships between a premise and a
potential hypothesis: the premise entails the hy-
pothesis (entailment), they contradict each other
(contradiction), or they are not related (neutral).
The original SNLI corpus contains also “the other”
category, which includes the sentence pairs lacking
consensus among multiple human annotators. As
in the related work, we remove this category. We
used the same split as in Bowman et al. (2015) and
other previous work.

The parse trees used in this paper are produced
by the Stanford PCFG Parser 3.5.3 (Klein and Man-
ning, 2003) and they are delivered as part of the
SNLI corpus. We use classiﬁcation accuracy as the
evaluation metric, as in related work.

Training We use the development set to select
models for testing. To help replicate our results,
we publish our code1. Below, we list our training
details. We use the Adam method (Kingma and
Ba, 2014) for optimization. The ﬁrst momentum
is set to be 0.9 and the second 0.999. The initial
learning rate is 0.0004 and the batch size is 32. All
hidden states of LSTMs, tree-LSTMs, and word
embeddings have 300 dimensions.

We use dropout with a rate of 0.5, which is
applied to all feedforward connections. We use
pre-trained 300-D Glove 840B vectors (Penning-
ton et al., 2014) to initialize our word embeddings.
Out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words are initialized ran-
domly with Gaussian samples. All vectors includ-
ing word embedding are updated during training.

5 Results

Overall performance Table 1 shows the results
of different models. The ﬁrst row is a baseline
classiﬁer presented by Bowman et al. (2015) that
considers handcrafted features such as BLEU score
of the hypothesis with respect to the premise, the
overlapped words, and the length difference be-
tween them, etc.

The next group of models (2)-(7) are based
on sentence encoding. The model of Bowman
et al. (2016) encodes the premise and hypothe-
sis with two different LSTMs. The model in Ven-
drov et al. (2015) uses unsupervised “skip-thoughts”
pre-training in GRU encoders. The approach pro-
posed by Mou et al. (2016) considers tree-based
CNN to capture sentence-level semantics, while
the model of Bowman et al. (2016) introduces a
stack-augmented parser-interpreter neural network
(SPINN) which combines parsing and interpreta-
tion within a single tree-sequence hybrid model.
The work by Liu et al. (2016) uses BiLSTM to gen-
erate sentence representations, and then replaces
average pooling with intra-attention. The approach
proposed by Munkhdalai and Yu (2016a) presents
a memory augmented neural network, neural se-
mantic encoders (NSE), to encode sentences.

which also outperform the previous models.

(8)-(15), are inter-sentence attention-based model.
The model marked with Rocktäschel et al. (2015)
is LSTMs enforcing the so called word-by-word
attention. The model of Wang and Jiang (2016) ex-
tends this idea to explicitly enforce word-by-word
matching between the hypothesis and the premise.
Long short-term memory-networks (LSTMN) with
deep attention fusion (Cheng et al., 2016) link the
current word to previous words stored in memory.
Parikh et al. (2016) proposed a decomposable atten-
tion model without relying on any word-order in-
formation. In general, adding intra-sentence atten-
tion yields further improvement, which is not very
surprising as it could help align the relevant text
spans between premise and hypothesis. The model
of Munkhdalai and Yu (2016b) extends the frame-
work of Wang and Jiang (2016) to a full n-ary tree
model and achieves further improvement. Sha et al.
(2016) proposes a special LSTM variant which con-
siders the attention vector of another sentence as an
inner state of LSTM. Paria et al. (2016) use a neu-
ral architecture with a complete binary tree-LSTM
encoders without syntactic information.

The table shows that our ESIM model achieves
an accuracy of 88.0%, which has already outper-
formed all the previous models, including those
using much more complicated network architec-
tures (Munkhdalai and Yu, 2016b).

We ensemble our ESIM model with syntactic
tree-LSTMs (Zhu et al., 2015) based on syntactic
parse trees and achieve signiﬁcant improvement
over our best sequential encoding model ESIM, at-
taining an accuracy of 88.6%. This shows that syn-
tactic tree-LSTMs complement well with ESIM.

Ablation analysis We further analyze the ma-
jor components that are of importance to help us
achieve good performance. From the best model,
we ﬁrst replace the syntactic tree-LSTM with the
full tree-LSTM without encoding syntactic parse
information. More speciﬁcally, two adjacent words
in a sentence are merged to form a parent node, and

Figure 3: An example for analysis. Subﬁgures (a) and (b) are the constituency parse trees of the premise
and hypothesis, respectively. “-” means a non-leaf or a null node. Subﬁgures (c) and (f) are attention
visualization of the tree model and ESIM, respectively. The darker the color, the greater the value. The
premise is on the x-axis and the hypothesis is on y-axis. Subﬁgures (d) and (e) are input gates’ l2-norm of
tree-LSTM and BiLSTM in inference composition, respectively.

this process continues and results in a full binary
tree, where padding nodes are inserted when there
are no enough leaves to form a full tree. Each tree
node is implemented with a tree-LSTM block (Zhu
et al., 2015) same as in model (17). Table 2 shows
that with this replacement, the performance drops

to 88.2%.

Furthermore, we note the importance of the layer
performing the enhancement for local inference in-
formation in Section 3.2 and the pooling layer in
inference composition in Section 3.3. Table 2 sug-
gests that the NLI task seems very sensitive to the

layers. If we remove the pooling layer in infer-
ence composition and replace it with summation
as in Parikh et al. (2016), the accuracy drops to
87.1%. If we remove the difference and element-
wise product from the local inference enhancement
layer, the accuracy drops to 87.0%. To provide
some detailed comparison with Parikh et al. (2016),
replacing bidirectional LSTMs in inference compo-
sition and also input encoding with feedforward
neural network reduces the accuracy to 87.3% and
86.3% respectively.

The difference between ESIM and each of the
other models listed in Table 2 is statistically signif-
icant under the one-tailed paired t-test at the 99%
signiﬁcance level. The difference between model
(17) and (18) is also signiﬁcant at the same level.
Note that we cannot perform signiﬁcance test be-
tween our models with the other models listed in
Table 1 since we do not have the output of the other
models.

If we remove the premise-based attention from
ESIM (model 23), the accuracy drops to 87.2% on
the test set. The premise-based attention means
when the system reads a word in a premise, it uses
soft attention to consider all relevant words in hy-
pothesis. Removing the hypothesis-based atten-
tion (model 24) decrease the accuracy to 86.5%,
where hypothesis-based attention is the attention
performed on the other direction for the sentence
pairs. The results show that removing hypothesis-
based attention affects the performance of our
model more, but removing the attention from the
other direction impairs the performance too.

The stand-alone syntactic tree-LSTM model
achieves an accuracy of 87.8%, which is compa-
rable to that of ESIM. We also computed the or-
acle score of merging syntactic tree-LSTM and
ESIM, which picks the right answer if either is
right. Such an oracle/upper-bound accuracy on test
set is 91.7%, which suggests how much tree-LSTM
and ESIM could ideally complement each other. As
far as the speed is concerned, training tree-LSTM
takes about 40 hours on Nvidia-Tesla K40M and
ESIM takes about 6 hours, which is easily extended
to larger scale of data.

Further analysis We showed that encoding syn-
tactic parsing information helps recognize natural
language inference—it additionally improves the
strong system. Figure 3 shows an example where
tree-LSTM makes a different and correct decision.
In subﬁgure (d), the larger values at the input gates

on nodes 9 and 10 indicate that those nodes are
important in making the ﬁnal decision. We observe
that in subﬁgure (c), nodes 9 and 10 are aligned to
node 29 in the premise. Such information helps the
system decide that this pair is a contradiction. Ac-
cordingly, in subﬁgure (e) of sequential BiLSTM,
the words sitting and down do not play an impor-
tant role for making the ﬁnal decision. Subﬁgure (f)
shows that sitting is equally aligned with reading
and standing and the alignment for word down is
not that useful.

6 Conclusions and Future Work

We propose neural network models for natural lan-
guage inference, which achieve the best results
reported on the SNLI benchmark. The results are
ﬁrst achieved through our enhanced sequential in-
ference model, which outperformed the previous
models, including those employing more compli-
cated network architectures, suggesting that the
potential of sequential inference models have not
been fully exploited yet. Based on this, we further
show that by explicitly considering recursive ar-
chitectures in both local inference modeling and
inference composition, we achieve additional im-
provement. Particularly, incorporating syntactic
parsing information contributes to our best result: it
further improves the performance even when added
to the already very strong model.

Future work interesting to us includes exploring
the usefulness of external resources such as Word-
Net and contrasting-meaning embedding (Chen
et al., 2015) to help increase the coverage of word-
level inference relations. Modeling negation more
closely within neural network frameworks (Socher
et al., 2013; Zhu et al., 2014) may help contradic-
tion detection.

Abstract

Reasoning and inference are central to hu-
man and artiﬁcial intelligence. Modeling
inference in human language is very chal-
lenging. With the availability of large an-
notated data (Bowman et al., 2015), it has
recently become feasible to train neural
network based inference models, which
have shown to be very effective. In this
paper, we present a new state-of-the-art re-
sult, achieving the accuracy of 88.6% on
the Stanford Natural Language Inference
Dataset. Unlike the previous top models
that use very complicated network architec-
tures, we ﬁrst demonstrate that carefully de-
signing sequential inference models based
on chain LSTMs can outperform all previ-
ous models. Based on this, we further show
that by explicitly considering recursive ar-
chitectures in both local inference model-
ing and inference composition, we achieve
additional improvement. Particularly, in-
corporating syntactic parsing information
contributes to our best result—it further im-
proves the performance even when added
to the already very strong model.

Introduction

Reasoning and inference are central to both human
and artiﬁcial intelligence. Modeling inference in
human language is notoriously challenging but is
a basic problem towards true natural language un-
derstanding, as pointed out by MacCartney and
Manning (2008), “a necessary (if not sufﬁcient)

condition for true natural language understanding
is a mastery of open-domain natural language in-
ference.” The previous work has included extensive
research on recognizing textual entailment.

Speciﬁcally, natural language inference (NLI)
is concerned with determining whether a natural-
language hypothesis h can be inferred from a
premise p, as depicted in the following example
from MacCartney (2009), where the hypothesis is
regarded to be entailed from the premise.

p: Several airlines polled saw costs grow more than
expected, even after adjusting for inﬂation.

h: Some of the companies in the poll reported cost

increases.

The most recent years have seen advances in
modeling natural language inference. An impor-
tant contribution is the creation of a much larger
annotated dataset, the Stanford Natural Language
Inference (SNLI) dataset (Bowman et al., 2015).
The corpus has 570,000 human-written English
sentence pairs manually labeled by multiple human
subjects. This makes it feasible to train more com-
plex inference models. Neural network models,
which often need relatively large annotated data to
estimate their parameters, have shown to achieve
the state of the art on SNLI (Bowman et al., 2015,
2016; Munkhdalai and Yu, 2016b; Parikh et al.,
2016; Sha et al., 2016; Paria et al., 2016).

While some previous top-performing models use
rather complicated network architectures to achieve
the state-of-the-art results (Munkhdalai and Yu,
2016b), we demonstrate in this paper that enhanc-
ing sequential inference models based on chain

models can outperform all previous results, sug-
gesting that the potentials of such sequential in-
ference approaches have not been fully exploited
yet. More speciﬁcally, we show that our sequential
inference model achieves an accuracy of 88.0% on
the SNLI benchmark.

Exploring syntax for NLI is very attractive to us.
In many problems, syntax and semantics interact
closely, including in semantic composition (Partee,
1995), among others. Complicated tasks such as
natural language inference could well involve both,
which has been discussed in the context of rec-
ognizing textual entailment (RTE) (Mehdad et al.,
2010; Ferrone and Zanzotto, 2014).
In this pa-
per, we are interested in exploring this within the
neural network frameworks, with the presence of
relatively large training data. We show that by
explicitly encoding parsing information with re-
cursive networks in both local inference modeling
and inference composition and by incorporating
it into our framework, we achieve additional im-
provement, increasing the performance to a new
state of the art with an 88.6% accuracy.

2 Related Work

Early work on natural language inference has been
performed on rather small datasets with more con-
ventional methods (refer to MacCartney (2009)
for a good literature survey), which includes a
large bulk of work on recognizing textual entail-
ment, such as (Dagan et al., 2005; Iftene and
Balahur-Dobrescu, 2007), among others. More
recently, Bowman et al. (2015) made available the
SNLI dataset with 570,000 human annotated sen-
tence pairs. They also experimented with simple
classiﬁcation models as well as simple neural net-
works that encode the premise and hypothesis in-
dependently. Rocktäschel et al. (2015) proposed
neural attention-based models for NLI, which cap-
tured the attention information. In general, atten-
tion based models have been shown to be effec-
tive in a wide range of tasks, including machine
translation (Bahdanau et al., 2014), speech recogni-
tion (Chorowski et al., 2015; Chan et al., 2016), im-
age caption (Xu et al., 2015), and text summariza-
tion (Rush et al., 2015; Chen et al., 2016), among
others. For NLI, the idea allows neural models to
pay attention to speciﬁc areas of the sentences.

A variety of more advanced networks have been
developed since then (Bowman et al., 2016; Ven-
drov et al., 2015; Mou et al., 2016; Liu et al., 2016;

Munkhdalai and Yu, 2016a; Rocktäschel et al.,
2015; Wang and Jiang, 2016; Cheng et al., 2016;
Parikh et al., 2016; Munkhdalai and Yu, 2016b;
Sha et al., 2016; Paria et al., 2016). Among them,
more relevant to ours are the approaches proposed
by Parikh et al. (2016) and Munkhdalai and Yu
(2016b), which are among the best performing mod-
els.

Parikh et al. (2016) propose a relatively sim-
ple but very effective decomposable model. The
model decomposes the NLI problem into subprob-
lems that can be solved separately. On the other
hand, Munkhdalai and Yu (2016b) propose much
more complicated networks that consider sequen-
tial LSTM-based encoding, recursive networks,
and complicated combinations of attention mod-
els, which provide about 0.5% gain over the results
reported by Parikh et al. (2016).

It is, however, not very clear if the potential of
the sequential inference networks has been well
exploited for NLI. In this paper, we ﬁrst revisit this
problem and show that enhancing sequential infer-
ence models based on chain networks can actually
outperform all previous results. We further show
that explicitly considering recursive architectures
to encode syntactic parsing information for NLI
could further improve the performance.

3 Hybrid Neural Inference Models

We present here our natural language inference net-
works which are composed of the following major
components: input encoding, local inference mod-
eling, and inference composition. Figure 1 shows a
high-level view of the architecture. Vertically, the
ﬁgure depicts the three major components, and hor-
izontally, the left side of the ﬁgure represents our
sequential NLI model named ESIM, and the right
side represents networks that incorporate syntactic
parsing information in tree LSTMs.

In our notation, we have two sentences a =
(a1, . . . , a(cid:96)a) and b = (b1, . . . , b(cid:96)b), where a is a
Rl is
premise and b a hypothesis. The ai or bj
an embedding of l-dimensional vector, which can
be initialized with some pre-trained word embed-
dings and organized with parse trees. The goal is to
predict a label y that indicates the logic relationship
between a and b.

3.1

Input Encoding

We employ bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM) as one
of our basic building blocks for NLI. We ﬁrst use it

generated by these two LSTMs at each time step
are concatenated to represent that time step and
its context. Note that we used LSTM memory
blocks in our models. We examined other recurrent
memory blocks such as GRUs (Gated Recurrent
Units) (Cho et al., 2014) and they are inferior to
LSTMs on the heldout set for our NLI task.

As discussed above, it is intriguing to explore
the effectiveness of syntax for natural language
inference; for example, whether it is useful even
when incorporated into the best-performing models.
To this end, we will also encode syntactic parse
trees of a premise and hypothesis through tree-
LSTM (Zhu et al., 2015; Tai et al., 2015; Le and
Zuidema, 2015), which extends the chain LSTM to
a recursive network (Socher et al., 2011).

Speciﬁcally, given the parse of a premise or hy-
pothesis, a tree node is deployed with a tree-LSTM
memory block depicted as in Figure 2 and com-
puted with Equations (3–10). In short, at each node,
an input vector xt and the hidden vectors of its two
children (the left child hL
t−1) are
taken in as the input to calculate the current node’s
hidden vector ht.

t−1 and the right hR

We describe the updating of a node at a high level
with Equation (3) to facilitate references later in the
paper, and the detailed computation is described
in (4–10). Speciﬁcally, the input of a node is used
to conﬁgure four gates: the input gate it, output
gate ot, and the two forget gates f L
t . The
memory cell ct considers each child’s cell vector,
t−1 and cR

to encode the input premise and hypothesis (Equa-
tion (1) and (2)). Here BiLSTM learns to represent
a word (e.g., ai) and its context. Later we will also
use BiLSTM to perform inference composition to
construct the ﬁnal prediction, where BiLSTM en-
codes local inference information and its interac-
tion. To bookkeep the notations for later use, we
write as ¯ai the hidden (output) state generated by
the BiLSTM at time i over the input sequence a.
The same is applied to ¯bj:

¯ai = BiLSTM(a, i),

Due to the space limit, we will skip the descrip-

Brieﬂy, when modeling a sequence, an LSTM em-
ploys a set of soft gates together with a memory
cell to control message ﬂows, resulting in an effec-
tive modeling of tracking long-distance informa-
tion/dependencies in a sequence.

In the current input encoding layer, xt is used to
encode a word embedding for a leaf node. Since
a non-leaf node does not correspond to a speciﬁc
word, we use a special vector x(cid:48)
t as its input, which
is like an unknown word. However, in the inference
composition layer that we discuss later, the goal
of using tree-LSTM is very different; the input xt
will be very different as well—it will encode local
inference information and will have values at all
tree nodes.

3.2 Local Inference Modeling

Modeling local subsentential inference between a
premise and hypothesis is the basic component for
determining the overall inference between these
two statements. To closely examine local infer-
ence, we explore both the sequential and syntactic
tree models that have been discussed above. The
former helps collect local inference for words and
their context, and the tree LSTM helps collect lo-
cal information between (linguistic) phrases and
clauses.

Locality of inference Modeling local inference
needs to employ some forms of hard or soft align-
ment to associate the relevant subcomponents be-
tween a premise and a hypothesis. This includes
early methods motivated from the alignment in
conventional automatic machine translation (Mac-
Cartney, 2009). In neural network models, this is
often achieved with soft attention.

Parikh et al. (2016) decomposed this process:
the word sequence of the premise (or hypothesis)
is regarded as a bag-of-word embedding vector
and inter-sentence “alignment” (or attention) is
computed individually to softly align each word

to the content of hypothesis (or premise, respec-
tively). While their basic framework is very effec-
tive, achieving one of the previous best results, us-
ing a pre-trained word embedding by itself does not
automatically consider the context around a word
in NLI. Parikh et al. (2016) did take into account
the word order and context information through an
optional distance-sensitive intra-sentence attention.
In this paper, we argue for leveraging attention
over the bidirectional sequential encoding of the
input, as discussed above. We will show that this
plays an important role in achieving our best results,
and the intra-sentence attention used by Parikh et al.
(2016) actually does not further improve over our
model, while the overall framework they proposed
is very effective.

Our soft alignment layer computes the attention
weights as the similarity of a hidden state tuple
<¯ai, ¯bj> between a premise and a hypothesis with
Equation (11). We did study more complicated
relationships between ¯ai and ¯bj with multilayer
perceptrons, but observed no further improvement
on the heldout data.

eij = ¯aT
i

¯bj.

(11)

In the formula, ¯ai and ¯bj are computed earlier
in Equations (1) and (2), or with Equation (3) when
tree-LSTM is used. Again, as discussed above, we
will use bidirectional LSTM and tree-LSTM to en-
code the premise and hypothesis, respectively. In
our sequential inference model, unlike in Parikh
et al. (2016) which proposed to use a function
F (¯ai), i.e., a feedforward neural network, to map
the original word representation for calculating eij,
we instead advocate to use BiLSTM, which en-
codes the information in premise and hypothesis
very well and achieves better performance shown in
the experiment section. We tried to apply the F (.)
function on our hidden states before computing eij
and it did not further help our models.

Local inference collected over sequences Lo-
cal inference is determined by the attention weight
eij computed above, which is used to obtain the
local relevance between a premise and hypothesis.
For the hidden state of a word in a premise, i.e., ¯ai
(already encoding the word itself and its context),
the relevant semantics in the hypothesis is iden-
tiﬁed and composed using eij, more speciﬁcally

with Equation (12).

˜ai =

˜bj =

also further modeled the interaction by feeding the
tuples into feedforward neural networks and added
the top layer hidden states to the above concate-
nation. We found that it does not further help the
inference accuracy on the heldout dataset.

}

Local inference collected over parse trees We
use tree models to help collect local inference in-
formation over linguistic phrases and clauses in
this layer. The tree structures of the premise and
hypothesis are produced by a constituency parser.
Once the hidden states of a tree are all computed
with Equation (3), we treat all tree nodes equally
as we do not have further heuristics to discrimi-
nate them, but leave the attention weights to ﬁgure
out their relationship. So, we use Equation (11)
to compute the attention weights for all node pairs
between a premise and hypothesis. This connects
all words, constituent phrases, and clauses between
the premise and hypothesis. We then collect the in-
formation between all the pairs with Equations (12)
and (13) and feed them into the next layer.

inference information
Enhancement of local
In our models, we further enhance the local in-
ference information collected. We compute the
difference and the element-wise product for the tu-
ple <¯a, ˜a> as well as for <¯b, ˜b>. We expect that
such operations could help sharpen local inference
information between elements in the tuples and cap-
ture inference relationships such as contradiction.
The difference and element-wise product are then
concatenated with the original vectors, ¯a and ˜a,
or ¯b and ˜b, respectively (Mou et al., 2016; Zhang
et al., 2017). The enhancement is performed for
both the sequential and the tree models.

˜a; ¯a
(cid:12)
˜b; ¯b

˜a],
˜b].

(15)

This process could be regarded as a special case
of modeling some high-order interaction between
the tuple elements. Along this direction, we have

To determine the overall inference relationship be-
tween a premise and hypothesis, we explore a com-
position layer to compose the enhanced local in-
ference information ma and mb. We perform the
composition sequentially or in its parse context
using BiLSTM and tree-LSTM, respectively.

The composition layer
In our sequential infer-
ence model, we keep using BiLSTM to compose
local inference information sequentially. The for-
mulas for BiLSTM are similar to those in Equations
(1) and (2) in their forms so we skip the details, but
the aim is very different here—they are used to cap-
ture local inference information ma and mb and
their context here for inference composition.

In the tree composition, the high-level formulas
of how a tree node is updated to compose local
inference is as follows:

1, hR
va,t = TrLSTM(F (ma,t), hL
1),
t
t
−
−
1, hR
vb,t = TrLSTM(F (mb,t), hL
1).
t

−

(16)

(17)

We propose to control model complexity in this
layer, since the concatenation we described above
to compute ma and mb can signiﬁcantly increase
the overall parameter size to potentially overﬁt the
models. We propose to use a mapping F as in
Equation (16) and (17). More speciﬁcally, we use a
1-layer feedforward neural network with the ReLU
activation. This function is also applied to BiLSTM
in our sequential inference composition.

Pooling Our inference model converts the result-
ing vectors obtained above to a ﬁxed-length vector
with pooling and feeds it to the ﬁnal classiﬁer to
determine the overall inference relationship.

We consider that summation (Parikh et al., 2016)
could be sensitive to the sequence length and hence
less robust. We instead suggest the following strat-
egy: compute both average and max pooling, and
concatenate all these vectors to form the ﬁnal ﬁxed
length vector v. Our experiments show that this
leads to signiﬁcantly better results than summa-
tion. The ﬁnal ﬁxed length vector v is calculated

as follows:

va,ave =

vb,ave =

(cid:96)a(cid:88)

i=1

(cid:96)b(cid:88)

j=1

(cid:96)bmax
j=1

vb,j,

(18)

(19)

v = [va,ave; va,max; vb,ave; vb,max].

(20)

Note that for tree composition, Equation (20)
is slightly different from that in sequential com-
position. Our tree composition will concatenate
also the hidden states computed for the roots with
Equations (16) and (17), which are not shown here.
We then put v into a ﬁnal multilayer perceptron
(MLP) classiﬁer. The MLP has a hidden layer with
tanh activation and softmax output layer in our ex-
periments. The entire model (all three components
described above) is trained end-to-end. For train-
ing, we use multi-class cross-entropy loss.

Overall inference models Our model can be
based only on the sequential networks by removing
all tree components and we call it Enhanced Se-
quential Inference Model (ESIM) (see the left part
of Figure 1). We will show that ESIM outperforms
all previous results. We will also encode parse in-
formation with tree LSTMs in multiple layers as
described (see the right side of Figure 1). We train
this model and incorporate it into ESIM by averag-
ing the predicted probabilities to get the ﬁnal label
for a premise-hypothesis pair. We will show that
parsing information complements very well with
ESIM and further improves the performance, and
we call the ﬁnal model Hybrid Inference Model
(HIM).

4 Experimental Setup

Data The Stanford Natural Language Inference
(SNLI) corpus (Bowman et al., 2015) focuses on
three basic relationships between a premise and a
potential hypothesis: the premise entails the hy-
pothesis (entailment), they contradict each other
(contradiction), or they are not related (neutral).
The original SNLI corpus contains also “the other”
category, which includes the sentence pairs lacking
consensus among multiple human annotators. As
in the related work, we remove this category. We
used the same split as in Bowman et al. (2015) and
other previous work.

The parse trees used in this paper are produced
by the Stanford PCFG Parser 3.5.3 (Klein and Man-
ning, 2003) and they are delivered as part of the
SNLI corpus. We use classiﬁcation accuracy as the
evaluation metric, as in related work.

Training We use the development set to select
models for testing. To help replicate our results,
we publish our code1. Below, we list our training
details. We use the Adam method (Kingma and
Ba, 2014) for optimization. The ﬁrst momentum
is set to be 0.9 and the second 0.999. The initial
learning rate is 0.0004 and the batch size is 32. All
hidden states of LSTMs, tree-LSTMs, and word
embeddings have 300 dimensions.

We use dropout with a rate of 0.5, which is
applied to all feedforward connections. We use
pre-trained 300-D Glove 840B vectors (Penning-
ton et al., 2014) to initialize our word embeddings.
Out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words are initialized ran-
domly with Gaussian samples. All vectors includ-
ing word embedding are updated during training.

5 Results

Overall performance Table 1 shows the results
of different models. The ﬁrst row is a baseline
classiﬁer presented by Bowman et al. (2015) that
considers handcrafted features such as BLEU score
of the hypothesis with respect to the premise, the
overlapped words, and the length difference be-
tween them, etc.

The next group of models (2)-(7) are based
on sentence encoding. The model of Bowman
et al. (2016) encodes the premise and hypothe-
sis with two different LSTMs. The model in Ven-
drov et al. (2015) uses unsupervised “skip-thoughts”
pre-training in GRU encoders. The approach pro-
posed by Mou et al. (2016) considers tree-based
CNN to capture sentence-level semantics, while
the model of Bowman et al. (2016) introduces a
stack-augmented parser-interpreter neural network
(SPINN) which combines parsing and interpreta-
tion within a single tree-sequence hybrid model.
The work by Liu et al. (2016) uses BiLSTM to gen-
erate sentence representations, and then replaces
average pooling with intra-attention. The approach
proposed by Munkhdalai and Yu (2016a) presents
a memory augmented neural network, neural se-
mantic encoders (NSE), to encode sentences.

which also outperform the previous models.

(8)-(15), are inter-sentence attention-based model.
The model marked with Rocktäschel et al. (2015)
is LSTMs enforcing the so called word-by-word
attention. The model of Wang and Jiang (2016) ex-
tends this idea to explicitly enforce word-by-word
matching between the hypothesis and the premise.
Long short-term memory-networks (LSTMN) with
deep attention fusion (Cheng et al., 2016) link the
current word to previous words stored in memory.
Parikh et al. (2016) proposed a decomposable atten-
tion model without relying on any word-order in-
formation. In general, adding intra-sentence atten-
tion yields further improvement, which is not very
surprising as it could help align the relevant text
spans between premise and hypothesis. The model
of Munkhdalai and Yu (2016b) extends the frame-
work of Wang and Jiang (2016) to a full n-ary tree
model and achieves further improvement. Sha et al.
(2016) proposes a special LSTM variant which con-
siders the attention vector of another sentence as an
inner state of LSTM. Paria et al. (2016) use a neu-
ral architecture with a complete binary tree-LSTM
encoders without syntactic information.

The table shows that our ESIM model achieves
an accuracy of 88.0%, which has already outper-
formed all the previous models, including those
using much more complicated network architec-
tures (Munkhdalai and Yu, 2016b).

We ensemble our ESIM model with syntactic
tree-LSTMs (Zhu et al., 2015) based on syntactic
parse trees and achieve signiﬁcant improvement
over our best sequential encoding model ESIM, at-
taining an accuracy of 88.6%. This shows that syn-
tactic tree-LSTMs complement well with ESIM.

Ablation analysis We further analyze the ma-
jor components that are of importance to help us
achieve good performance. From the best model,
we ﬁrst replace the syntactic tree-LSTM with the
full tree-LSTM without encoding syntactic parse
information. More speciﬁcally, two adjacent words
in a sentence are merged to form a parent node, and

Figure 3: An example for analysis. Subﬁgures (a) and (b) are the constituency parse trees of the premise
and hypothesis, respectively. “-” means a non-leaf or a null node. Subﬁgures (c) and (f) are attention
visualization of the tree model and ESIM, respectively. The darker the color, the greater the value. The
premise is on the x-axis and the hypothesis is on y-axis. Subﬁgures (d) and (e) are input gates’ l2-norm of
tree-LSTM and BiLSTM in inference composition, respectively.

this process continues and results in a full binary
tree, where padding nodes are inserted when there
are no enough leaves to form a full tree. Each tree
node is implemented with a tree-LSTM block (Zhu
et al., 2015) same as in model (17). Table 2 shows
that with this replacement, the performance drops

to 88.2%.

Furthermore, we note the importance of the layer
performing the enhancement for local inference in-
formation in Section 3.2 and the pooling layer in
inference composition in Section 3.3. Table 2 sug-
gests that the NLI task seems very sensitive to the

layers. If we remove the pooling layer in infer-
ence composition and replace it with summation
as in Parikh et al. (2016), the accuracy drops to
87.1%. If we remove the difference and element-
wise product from the local inference enhancement
layer, the accuracy drops to 87.0%. To provide
some detailed comparison with Parikh et al. (2016),
replacing bidirectional LSTMs in inference compo-
sition and also input encoding with feedforward
neural network reduces the accuracy to 87.3% and
86.3% respectively.

The difference between ESIM and each of the
other models listed in Table 2 is statistically signif-
icant under the one-tailed paired t-test at the 99%
signiﬁcance level. The difference between model
(17) and (18) is also signiﬁcant at the same level.
Note that we cannot perform signiﬁcance test be-
tween our models with the other models listed in
Table 1 since we do not have the output of the other
models.

If we remove the premise-based attention from
ESIM (model 23), the accuracy drops to 87.2% on
the test set. The premise-based attention means
when the system reads a word in a premise, it uses
soft attention to consider all relevant words in hy-
pothesis. Removing the hypothesis-based atten-
tion (model 24) decrease the accuracy to 86.5%,
where hypothesis-based attention is the attention
performed on the other direction for the sentence
pairs. The results show that removing hypothesis-
based attention affects the performance of our
model more, but removing the attention from the
other direction impairs the performance too.

The stand-alone syntactic tree-LSTM model
achieves an accuracy of 87.8%, which is compa-
rable to that of ESIM. We also computed the or-
acle score of merging syntactic tree-LSTM and
ESIM, which picks the right answer if either is
right. Such an oracle/upper-bound accuracy on test
set is 91.7%, which suggests how much tree-LSTM
and ESIM could ideally complement each other. As
far as the speed is concerned, training tree-LSTM
takes about 40 hours on Nvidia-Tesla K40M and
ESIM takes about 6 hours, which is easily extended
to larger scale of data.

Further analysis We showed that encoding syn-
tactic parsing information helps recognize natural
language inference—it additionally improves the
strong system. Figure 3 shows an example where
tree-LSTM makes a different and correct decision.
In subﬁgure (d), the larger values at the input gates

on nodes 9 and 10 indicate that those nodes are
important in making the ﬁnal decision. We observe
that in subﬁgure (c), nodes 9 and 10 are aligned to
node 29 in the premise. Such information helps the
system decide that this pair is a contradiction. Ac-
cordingly, in subﬁgure (e) of sequential BiLSTM,
the words sitting and down do not play an impor-
tant role for making the ﬁnal decision. Subﬁgure (f)
shows that sitting is equally aligned with reading
and standing and the alignment for word down is
not that useful.

6 Conclusions and Future Work

We propose neural network models for natural lan-
guage inference, which achieve the best results
reported on the SNLI benchmark. The results are
ﬁrst achieved through our enhanced sequential in-
ference model, which outperformed the previous
models, including those employing more compli-
cated network architectures, suggesting that the
potential of sequential inference models have not
been fully exploited yet. Based on this, we further
show that by explicitly considering recursive ar-
chitectures in both local inference modeling and
inference composition, we achieve additional im-
provement. Particularly, incorporating syntactic
parsing information contributes to our best result: it
further improves the performance even when added
to the already very strong model.

Future work interesting to us includes exploring
the usefulness of external resources such as Word-
Net and contrasting-meaning embedding (Chen
et al., 2015) to help increase the coverage of word-
level inference relations. Modeling negation more
closely within neural network frameworks (Socher
et al., 2013; Zhu et al., 2014) may help contradic-
tion detection.
