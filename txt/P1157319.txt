Language unit is a fundamental conception in modern linguistics, but the boundaries are not 
clear between language levels both in the past and present. As language is a multi-level system, 
quantification rather than microscopic grammatical analysis should be used to investigate into 
this question. In this paper, Menzerath-Altmann law is used to make out the basic language units 
in written Chinese. The results show that “stroke > component > word > clause > sentence” is 
the hierarchical structure of written Chinese. 

1  Introduction 

Language levels and language units are critical conceptions in a language system, and they are highly 
related with the entities in a language, as well as the methods in linguistics. The conception of language 
unit is definitely put forward by Saussure in the first half of the 20th century. In his seminal book repre-
senting the birth of modern linguistics, Saussure puts forward the conceptions of language entities or 
language units and analyzes the methods as well as difficulties of dividing the spoken chain into lan-
guage units. Moreover, Saussure distinguished the concept of language units from speech units. Lan-
guage unit becomes the fundamental problem in modern linguistics. The conception of language level 
is introduced by American descriptive linguistics. Gleason (1956) distinguishes three types of language 
levels: language levels of structure, analysis and speech. Later, a number of other linguistic theories 
(Halliday, 1985; Hudson, 2010; Miyagawa et al., 2013; Nordström, 2014) treat language as a multi-level 
system. 

Generally, five language units are commonly recognized by grammarians: morpheme, word, phrase, 
clause and sentence (Lyons, 1968). However, different linguistic schools have different opinions upon 
the systematicness of language, therefore, the methods and standards they use to divide language levels 
and  units  are  different.  Mackey  (1967)  lists  seven  sets  of  language  levels  from  different  linguistic 
schools, and the maximum is Bulundaer’s 14 levels, and the minimum is Harris’s 2 levels. These lan-
guage units include sound, word, phrase, sentence, phone, phoneme, morph, morpheme, syllable, affix, 
word-group, and so on. The boundaries between language levels are not clear in the past for the lack of 
a common standard, however, it is the same after the introduction of the conception of language level. 
The most characteristic feature of modern linguistics is structuralism. Briefly, this means that lan-
guage  is  not  a  haphazard  conglomerate  of  words  and  sounds  but  a  tightly  knit  and  coherent  whole. 
However,  linguistics  is  traditionally  preoccupied  with  the  fine  detail  of  language  structure  (Hudson, 
2010:104), or in other words, the language phenomena at the microscopic scale rather than at the system 
level (Liu and Cong, 2014). Therefore, it is not ordinarily feasible to analyze each language level sepa-
rately, and the work must be carried on simultaneously on all levels. Moreover, the results should be 
stated in terms of an orderly hierarchy of levels (Lyons, 1968). 

Quantification is necessary in the inquiry into the structure of the language system (Altmann, 1987, 
1996). Without quantification, it would be extremely difficult to investigate language as a multi-level 
system empirically. Unfortunately, systems thinking in linguistics is generally unaffected by quantitative 
methods. Liu & Cong (2014) characterize modern Chinese as a multi-level system from the complex 

 
 

 

 

network. However, their emphasis is on the levels of grammatical analysis, for example, syntax and 
semantics, but not language levels. In this paper, we try to analyze the language levels of written Chinese 
as a multi-level system using Menzerath-Altmann law. 

Menzerath-Altmann law is a general statement about the natural language constructions which says: 
the longer is a construction, the shorter are its constituents. Language is a whole complex system, and it 
is a set of relations. The language units correlate with each other in different levels and in complex ways 
through the relations. The whole is composed by its parts, and they restrains mutually. Language units 
of the same levels are relatively homogeneous. Therefore, the relation between two adjacent language 
levels is “whole-part”. 

Actually, in quantitative linguistics, the relationship between “whole-part” has been extensively in-
vestigated (Menzerath, 1954; Krott, 1996; Uhlírová, 1997; Mikros and Milička, 2014; Milička, 2014). 
The relation was investigated and tested on many linguistic levels and in many languages and even on 
some non-linguistic data (Baixeries et al., 2013). Köhler (1984) conducted the first empirical test of the 
Menzerath-Altmann law on “sentence > clause > word”, analyzing German and English short stories 
and philosophical texts. The tests on the data confirmed the validity of the law with high significance. 
Heups (1983) evaluates 10,668 sentences from 13 texts separated with respect to text genre and her 
results also confirm the Menzeraht-Altmann law with high significance. The law has also been used to 
study  phenomena  on  the  supra-sentencial  level  (Hřebíček,  1990,  1992)  and  fractal  structures  of  text 
(Hřebíček, 1994; Andres, 2010). This is why this law is considered one of the most frequently corrobo-
rated  laws in  linguistics. The  law is a  good  example of  the  importance  of the quantitative  linguistic 
methodology since it clearly shows that the  “independent language subsystems” are in fact intercon-
nected by relationships which are hard to detect by a qualitative research. 

In this paper, we will test the construction units in written Chinese, which includes stroke, component, 
character, word, clause and sentence. We do not include phrase in our language units list because it is 
hard to divide a sentence into one or several independent phrases in written Chinese. Despite of this, it 
can be inferred from the Menzerathian results of “sentence-clause-word”. That is to say, if “sentence-
clause-word” fits well with Menzerath’s law, then the unit phrase in written Chinese can be left out, or 
we should reconsider phrase as an indispensable language unit in written Chinese. 

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces the materials and methods 
of the present study. Section 3 presents the results of the tests for different hierarchical language units. 
Section 4 concludes the study and makes suggestions for further research. 

2  Materials and Methods 

We use the Lancaster Chinese corpus (LCMC) as the testing material. The corpus is segmented and part 
of speech (POS) tagged, and its basic information is in table 1.

Table 1. Basic information of LCMC 

The language units we will test in this paper are stroke, component, character, word, clause and sen-
tence. The reason why we do not include phrase here is that a complete sentence or clause cannot be 
divided into several sequential phrases, both theoretically and practically. 

All the language units are easy to get in LCMC by using some tools except clause. Therefore, in the 

following, we will first define the other language units, and then give our methods of defining phrase. 

The stroke is a segment written with one uninterrupted movement. The component is the constructing 
units of characters which have more than one strokes. The character are logograms used in the writing 
of Chinese, which is called hanzi in Chinese. For example, the word “语言”(“yǔ yán”, which means 
“language”) consists of two characters “语,  言” (“yǔ, yán”, which means “language, parole”), and the 
two characters have nine strokes “丶, ㇊, —,  丨,  ㄱ, —,  丨,  ㄱ, —” and seven strokes “丶, —, —, —, 

 

 

                                                              .                                                                                                                                                                                   
In this function, y represents the length of the upper language unit, and x represent the mean length 
of the  lower language  unit;  a,  b, c  are  parameters  which  seem  to  depend  mainly  on  the  level  of the 
language units under investigation: much more than on language, the kind of text, or author as previously 
expected, and e is natural constant, which equals 2.71828 approximately. The goodness of fit can be 
seen from determination coefficient R2. We say the result is accepted for R2 > 0.75, good for R2 > 0.80, 
and very good for R2 > 0.90. 
 

丨,  ㄱ, —” respectively, eleven in total. “语” “言” have five components “讠” “五” “口” and one com-
ponent  “言” (means  “parole”), respectively. To  measure the  number  of strokes  and  components  of  a 
word, we used a list consisting of 20,902 characters (CJK Unified Ideographs) with numbers of strokes 
and components of each character. 

In written Chinese, sentences are separated from one another by using special marks of punctuation 
(full-stop, question-mark, exclamation-mark). As for our case, the sentences are tagged in LCMC, so 
here there is no difficulties distinguishing sentence. 

Clause is not tagged in LCMC, nor in any other corpus available. Xing (1997:13) states that clause is 
the smallest independent grammatical unit of expression. But this definition can hardly be used to obtain 
the clauses in LCMC. Lu (2006) analyzes a long sentence from a literary book and claims that the con-
stituents just between two punctuations (comma and period) can be defined as clauses roughly. We be-
lieve  that  although  this  method  is  not  so  exact  in  grammatical  analyses,  it  can  in  large-scale-corpus 
studies. But we need to state that, since in LCMC sentences are tagged, we choose comma and semicolon 
as our marks of clause boundaries. 

After obtaining all the statics with respect to language units in LCMC, we use the Menzerath-Altmann 

law to fit the hierarchical data. 

Menzerath-Altmann law (short for Menzerathian function) describes the mathematical relation be-

tween two adjacent language units, and its model function is

3  Results 

The language units we will examine in this paper are stroke > component > character > word > clause > 
sentence  (here  we  use  “>”  to  direct  to  a  higher-rank  unit  in  written  Chinese).  Since  the  Menzerath-
Altmann law is only used to fit the data of two adjacent language units, we corroborate that the fitting 
results  of  these  five  groups,  namely  “component>  character  >  word”,  “stroke  >  character  >  word”, 
“stroke > component > word”, “component > word > clause”, “word > clause > sentence”, can answer 
the question of the hierarchical structure in written Chinese. We will give the result of each group in the 
following. We begin with the word level since it is regarded as the most basic language unit in all lan-
guages. 

3.1  Component > Character > Word 

The Menzerathian data of “component > character > word” can be seen in Table 2. In this group, word 
length is measured in character, and character length is measured in component. Mean character length 
can be calculated with this function: 

In this function, i refers to word length class, i.e. the first column in Table 2; Mi represents mean character 
length of word length class i (if a word’s length is 1, then it belongs to word length class 1, and the like), 
i.e. the second column in Table 2; Fi represents the sum length of all the characters (measured in com-
ponent) in the words (based on tokens) of word length class i; Fi’represents the number of words (based 
on tokens) of word length class i.

In table 2, we can see that there are ten word length classes and their corresponding mean character 
lengths. We fit the Menzerathian function introduced in section 2 to the two groups of variables. The 
goodness of fit indicator R2 = 0.1625 means that the fitting result is unaccepted, which indicate that the 
hierarchical group “component > character > word” does not line with Menzerath-Altmann law. There-
fore, next, we need to test two other possible groups, “stroke > character > word” and “stroke > compo-
nent > word” to find out the hierarchy in word level. 

3.2  Stroke > Character > Word 

We replace component in “component > character > word” with stroke, and the Menzerathian data can 
be seen in Table 3. In this group, word length is measured in character, but character length is measured 
in stroke instead.

Table 3. Hierarchical data of “stroke > character > word” 

 
We fit the Menzerathian function to the two groups of variables in Table 3, and the goodness of fit 
indicator  R2 =  0.5009  means  that  the  fitting  result  is  also  unaccepted. This  indicates  that  the  group 
“stroke > character > word” does not line with Menzerath-Altmann law. Then the only possible group 
in the word level is “stroke > component > word”. 

3.3  Stroke > Component > Word 

The Menzerathian data of “stroke > component > word” is displayed in Table 4. In this group, word 
length is measured in component, and component length is measured in stroke.

Then we fit the Menzerathian function to the data in Table 4, and we have a good result this time. The 
fitting is displayed in Figure 1, and the fitting results, i.e. parameters (with 95% confidence bounds) and 
determination coefficient are shown in the bottom of Table 4. The value of the goodness of fit indicator 
R2 is 0.8982, which means that the result is good, and the group “stroke > component > word” lines with 
Menzerath-Altmann law. 
 

Figure 1. Fitting Menzerath-Altmann law to the hierarchical data of “stroke > component > word” 

 

In sum, in word-level, component is its immediate lower basic language unit. Since above word level, 
there are two other language units, we first need to examine the group “component > word > clause” to 
determine if we need go into “component > word > sentence”. 

3.4  Component > Word > Clause 

Table 5 shows the Menzerathian data of “component > word > clause”. In this group, clause length is 
measured in word, and word length is measured in component.

Table 5. Hierarchical data of “ component > word > clause” 

 

 

 

We then fit the Menzerathian function to the two groups of variables in Table 5. The fitting is displayed 
in Figure 2, and the results is shown in the bottom of Table 5. As can be seen from the value of  R2 
(0.7657) in Table 5, the fitting result is accepted. 
 

Figure 2. Fitting Menzerath-Altmann law to the hierarchical data of “ component > word > clause” 

 

Although the fitting result (R2 = 0.7657) in this group is not as good as in “stroke > component > 
word” (R2 = 0.8982), the group “component > word > clause” lines with Menzerath-Altmann law. This 
means that clause is the immediate higher language unit of word, thus we need not go into the group 
“component > word > sentence”. Ultimately, we only have “word > clause > sentence” to be tested. 

3.5  Word > Clause > Sentence 

Table 6 shows the Menzerathian data of this group. As can be seen in Table 6, the sentence length is 
measured in clause, and the clause length is measured in word.

The Menzerathian function is again used, and the fitting is displayed in Figure 3. As can be seen from 
the fitting results in Table 6, the goodness of fit indicator R2 (0.8498) indicates the result is good. This 
means that the group “word > clause > sentence” lines with Menzerath-Altmann law.

4  Discussions and Conclusions 

In section 3 we tested five Menzerathian groups, namely “component > character > word”, “stroke > 
character  >  word”, “stroke  > component  >  word”,  “component  >  word  >  clause”,  “word > clause  > 
sentence”. The results shows that only “stroke > component > word”, “component > word > clause” and 
“word > clause > sentence” line with Menzrath-Altmann law. However, the fitting results of “compo-
nent > word > clause” and “word > clause > sentence” are not as good as that of “stroke > component > 
word”. We think that there are two possible reasons. One reason is the data sparseness problem: clause 
length distribution is sparser than word length distribution because the length range of word is more 
fixed than that of clause. The other reason may be the rough way of segmenting clauses by means of 
punctuations: the clauses obtained in this way may be a little bigger or smaller than the practical situation. 
Generally, the results indicate that “stroke > component > word > clause > sentence” is a Menzrathian 
hierarchy in written Chinese. 

Character is an easy-to-distinguish language unit in written Chinese; clause is commonly regarded as 
one level of language unit by grammarians. However, they are not included in the Menzerathian hierar-
chy, i.e. they are not basic language units. For character, the reason may be that although there are thou-
sands of single-character words, they are not enough for communication. The combinations of characters 
into multi-character words makes ends meet. In classic Chinese, Character may be a basic language unit, 
however, it is replaced by word in modern Chinese, because the classic Chinese habitually uses mono-
syllable words while the modern Chinese prefers to choose multi-syllable words to express the same 
meaning. As for phrase, first, it is difficult to segment a sentence into several phrase sequences; secondly, 
from a quantitative perspective, the main reason may be that clause can directly be composed of words, 
but not via one level of phrase. 

That  language  is  a  system  has  been  put  forward  for  about  100  years,  however,  it  has  never  been 
realized until quantification is introduced into linguistics. In this paper, we shows that Menzerath-Alt-
mann law can be an efficient way of finding the basic language units in a language. In the future, we 
will investigate into this question from a diachronic perspective to see if the basic language units have 
changed with time.
