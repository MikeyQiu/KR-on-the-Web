Abstract

This paper introduces LX-SenseAnnotator, a user-friendly interface tool for manual word sense
annotation. The demonstration will show how input texts are loaded by the tool, the options available
to the annotator for displaying and browsing texts, and how word senses are displayed and manually
assigned. The ﬂexibility of LX-SenseAnnotator, including the support of a variety of languages and
the handling of pre-processed texts with different tagsets, will also be addressed.

1 Introduction

Annotated corpora are a cornerstone of Natural Language Processing (NLP), supporting the analysis
of large quantities of text across a wide variety of contexts (Leech, 2004) and the development and
evaluation of processing tools. There has been an increased interest in “high quality linguistic annotations
of corpora” at the semantic level, with word senses in particular being “both elusive and central to many
areas of NLP” (Passonneau et al., 2012). Sense annotated corpora are useful, for example, as training
data for Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) tools (Agirre and Soroa, 2009), many of which are based
on the Princeton WordNet approach to the lexical semantics of nouns, verbs, adjectives and adverbs
(Fellbaum, 1998).

This format is widely used to build sense-annotated corpora in a variety of languages—examples in-
clude parallel corpora such as the English/Italian MultiSemCor (Bentivogli and Pianta, 2002) and corpora
in languages such as Japanese, Bulgarian, German, Polish and many more (Global WordNet Association,
2013). Despite the need for these corpora to train and test new and developing WSD approaches (Wu
et al., 2007), tools for manual sense-annotation are not easy to come by.

Finding any information at all about such tools is difﬁcult, and those that are described are often done
so in the context of the speciﬁc purposes for which they were developed. For example, the tools used to
manually annotate the English MASC Corpus (Passonneau et al., 2012) and Chinese Word Sense Anno-
tated Corpus (Wu et al., 2007) both seem intrinsically tied to those particular corpora. Such examples
demonstrate the need for a more open, ﬂexible solution for manual word-sense annotation that is more
“readily adaptable to different annotation problems”(O’Donnell, 2008).

As part of our research on WSD in Portuguese, we have encountered the need for a more user-friendly
way to manually annotate corpora with information about word senses. Based on these requirements, we
present LX-SenseAnnotator, a ﬂexible user-interface tool for browsing texts and annotating them with
senses pulled from a Princeton-style WordNet. We are using this tool to produce a gold-standard corpus
annotated with senses from our Portuguese WordNet for use in our own WSD tasks, and in this paper
describe how its usability and ﬂexibility make it well-suited to similar manual annotation tasks using
source texts and WordNet-based lexicons in a variety of different languages.

2 Importing Text

The current implementation of LX-SenseAnnotator is designed for the import of text ﬁles that have
already been tagged and morphologically analyzed (in particular, POS-tagged and lemmatized) in an

existing pipeline of NLP tools (Branco and Silva, 2006). POS-tagging in particular makes the separation
of the input text according to which words are and are not sense-taggable (as described in the next
section) very straightforward. It is of course assumed that the preprocessed tags in the input text have
been veriﬁed and are correct.

A goal for LX-SenseAnnotator is to support the import of source text in a variety of different formats.
The code that currently reads and interprets input text is stored in a stand-alone C++ function, making it
easy for the tool to be tuned to allow texts pre-processed using different types of tagsets to be imported
depending on the goals of particular users. Coupled with the possibility of reading data from different
WordNets (any lexical semantic network in any language that adheres to the Princeton WordNet format
can be handled), a wide range of languages and different tagsets for each of those languages can be
served by LX-SenseAnnotator.

3 Displaying and Browsing Texts

Before being loaded into the text edit panel, each word from the input text is analyzed according to its
need for sense-tagging. In accordance with the Princeton format, nouns, verbs, adjectives and adverbs
are separated from the rest of the text as potential candidates for sense-tagging and marked in red, so
that they can be easily seen against the rest of the text, which is coloured in a dark blue except for those
words that have already been annotated, which are marked in green (Figure 1). An additional search
is performed on the words identiﬁed as being sense-taggable to ensure that they actually exist in the
uploaded WordNet, in this case our Portuguese version—those that do not are also excluded from the
red, sense-taggable portions of the text.

Figure 1: Displaying a list of senses for the word ‘´area’ (English ‘area’) using LX-SenseAnnotator.

Once the pre-processed text has been uploaded, the human annotator has a choice of viewing it in
the text edit panel in three different views—source text, sense-annotated text and raw text—which can
be cycled between using a simple tab widget at the top of the panel. The source text tab displays exactly
the original source text (complete with all of the tags present in the imported text). The sense-annotated
text tab displays the text with all of the tags from the original source text, and appends the newly added
sense tags to the text as the human annotator works—essentially, a continually-updated view of how the
output ﬁle will be.

The raw text tab displays the text in the cleanest view for reading—all of the tags from the original
source text, as well as newly added sense tags, are omitted, allowing for easier reading by the anno-
tator (Figure 2). Our own shallow processing tools used to pre-process the text prior to input include
a tokenizer which, among other functions, expands Portuguese contracted forms. For example, ‘do’ is
expanded into two separate tokens, ‘de+o’ (‘of+the’ in English). To further aid readability, the current
Portuguese LX-SenseAnnotator implementation reverses such tokenizations in the raw text tab.

annotated in red.

4 Displaying and Assigning Senses

In any of the three viewing tabs, the annotator can either click on a red, sense-taggable word, or use a
scroll-box to browse through the text with currently sense-taggable words. Selecting a word highlights
it, and displays the available senses in a separate sense results panel to the right of the text edit panel
(Figure 1). The available senses are sourced by querying the presence of the lemma of the selected word
in any of the synsets in the index.sense ﬁle (limited to the appropriate POS—noun, verb, adjective or
adverb). If the word is in a synset, the 8-digit offset of that synset is searched for in the corresponding
data ﬁle (data.noun, data.verb, etc.) and the results displayed in the right-hand panel as a list of possible
options for the selected word.

Information is provided with each sense result to give annotators everything they need to help them
decide which sense to assign to a selected word. Using the information from the data (.noun, .verb,
etc.) ﬁle where the synset was found, each sense result is populated with the main lemma, the POS and
the 8-digit offset of the synset. To provide context, this is supplemented with the other words from the
synset, which are presented as synonyms, and a selection of the pointers for that synset pulled from the
data ﬁle (hyper and hyponyms, holonyms, antonyms, entailments, etc.).

After deciding on the most appropriate sense for the selected word, double clicking it in the right-
hand sense results panel automatically assigns that sense to the occurence of the word selected in the
left-hand text edit panel. In all three viewing tabs, the newly sense-annotated word becomes green, and
in the sense-annotated text tab the annotation itself can be seen appended to the selected word. The word
is removed from the list of words yet to be annotated, although words which have already been sense-
annotated, now displayed in green, can still be selected to allow annotators to assign a different option
should they change their mind later.

5 Usability and Flexibility

As mentioned earlier in the paper, LX-SenseAnnotator can read lexical data for any language providing
that it adheres to the Princeton WordNet format. The current implementation loads our Portuguese Word-
Net from a speciﬁc directory, from which any number of individual directories containing WordNet-style
lexicons can be included and cycled between within the GUI to display senses in different languages.
This means that different texts in different languages can be annotated just as easily as each other, simply
by loading senses from a different WordNet directory.

Parallel to this is the interpretation of the tags already applied to the input text at the time of import.
As the code for handling source text is assigned to a separate, stand-alone C++ function, it is possible
to create new classes to interpret tagsets. We plan to further streamline this process by incorporating a
simple GUI for annotators to create and edit their own tags, which the program can use to automatically
create new versions of the standalone function for interpreting new tagsets in different languages. As
the number of supported tagsets grows as a result, so does the ﬂexibility of LX-SenseAnnotator, helping
to make manual sense annotation “as ﬂexible for use with common tools and frameworks as possible”
(Passonneau et al., 2012).

6 Conclusions

This paper has demonstrated LX-SenseAnnotator, an easy-to-use interface tool for annotating corpora
with word-sense data based on a WordNet-style lexicon. There are increasing calls for a “community-
wide, collaborative effort to produce open, high quality annotated corpora” that are both “easily accessi-
ble and available for use by anyone” (Passonneau et al., 2012). LX-SenseAnnotator can contribute to this
effort, offering a ﬂexible, user-friendly platform to build sense-annotated corpora and being particularly
suited to creating gold-standard corpora for use in NLP research.

As well as working on improving ﬂexibility in the form of customisable support for tagsets in future
updates of LX-SenseAnnotator, there are other elements that are worth taking into consideration. The
assumption that the tags in preprocessed input texts are correct has already been mentioned, but speciﬁc
handling for incorrect tags assigned during preprocessing is important, and providing annotators with the
option to highlight and correct such errors using LX-SenseAnnotator would be beneﬁcial. It would also
be advantageous if LX-SenseAnnotator were able to handle not just different texts in different languages,
but also cases where multiple languages are used within the same text.

We plan to start using the current version of LX-SenseAnnotator to produce a gold-standard sense-
annotated corpus in Portuguese for use in our own WSD research, during which process we hope to
evaluate the tool from a usability perspective with a team of annotators. We also aim to release LX-
SenseAnnotator in the near future as part of the LX-Center (NLX, nd), our existing collection of NLP
tools and resources.
