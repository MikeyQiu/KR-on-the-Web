ABSTRACT
Entity linking has recently been the subject of a significant body of
research. Currently, the best performing approaches rely on trained
mono-lingual models. Porting these approaches to other languages
is consequently a difficult endeavor as it requires corresponding
training data and retraining of the models. We address this draw-
back by presenting a novel multilingual, knowledge-base agnostic
and deterministic approach to entity linking, dubbed MAG. MAG
is based on a combination of context-based retrieval on structured
knowledge bases and graph algorithms. We evaluate MAG on 23
data sets and in 7 languages. Our results show that the best approach
trained on English datasets (PBOH) achieves a micro F-measure
that is up to 4 times worse on datasets in other languages. MAG on
the other hand achieves state-of-the-art performance on English
datasets and reaches a micro F-measure that is up to 0.6 higher than
that of PBOH on non-English languages.

1 INTRODUCTION
More than one exabyte of data is added to the Web every day.1
Automatic extraction of knowledge from this data demands the use
of efficient Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques such as
text aggregation, text summarization and knowledge extraction.
One of the most important NLP tasks is Entity Linking (EL), also
known as Named Entity Disambiguation (NED). The goal here is
as follows: Given a piece of text, a reference knowledge base K and
a set of entity mentions in that text, map each entity mention to
the corresponding resource in K.

Several challenges have to be addressed when dealing with EL.
For example, an entity can have a large number of surface forms (SF)
(also known as labels) due to synonymy, acronyms and typos. For
example, New York City, NY and Big Apple are all labels for the
same entity. Moreover, multiple entities can share the same name
due to homonymy and ambiguity. For example, both the state and
the city of New York are called New York. Despite the complexity of
the endeavor, EL approaches have achieved increasingly better re-
sults over the past few years by relying on trained machine learning
models (see [45] for an overview). A portion of these approaches
claim to be multilingual and rely on using cross-lingual dictionaries.
However, our experiments (see Section 4) show that the underly-
ing models being trained on English corpora make them prone to
failure when migrated to a different language. For example, while
PBOH [15] achieves an average micro F-measure of 0.69 on corpora
in English, it only achieves an average micro F-measure of 0.31 on
other languages.

We alleviate this problem by presenting MAG, a novel multi-
lingual EL approach. MAG (Multilingual AGDISTIS) is based on
concepts similar to those underlying AGDISTIS [44] but goes be-
yond this approach by relying on time-efficient graph algorithms
combined with language-independent features to link entities to a
given reference knowledge base. Hence, MAG is knowledge-base
agnostic, i.e., it can be deployed on any reference knowledge base K.
Our approach is also deterministic and does not rely on any trained
model. Hence, it can be deployed on virtually any language.

The main contributions of this paper can be summarized as

follows:

Moussallem et al.

• We present a novel multilingual and deterministic approach
for EL which combines lightweight and easily extensible
graph-based algorithms with a new context-based retrieval
method.

• MAG features an innovative candidate generation method
which relies on various filter methods and search types for
a better candidate selection.

• We provide a thorough evaluation of our overall system on
23 data sets using the GERBIL platform [45]. Our results
show that MAG achieves state-of-the-art performance on
English. In addition, MAG outperforms all state-of-the-art
approaches on 6 non-English data sets.

MAG was implemented within the AGDISTIS framework.2 The
version of MAG used in this paper and also all experimental results
are publicly available34.

2 RELATED WORK
EL approaches can be subdivided into 2 different classes: 1) English-
only approaches which are based and evaluated on English data
sets and 2) multilingual approaches.

English-only In 2013, Van Erp et al. [9] proposed an approach,
dubbed NERD-ML, for entity recognition tailored for extracting
entities from tweets. This approach relies on entity type classifi-
cation over a rich feature vector composed of a set of linguistic
components. Next to that, a plethora of other approaches including
[3, 5, 13, 17, 25, 28, 36, 50] have been developed. These approaches
mostly rely on graph algorithms and/or on machine-learning tech-
niques. However, most of them do not offer a webservice nor an
implementation that is publicly available and are thus difficult to
compare.

Multilingual A large number of multilingual approaches have
been developed over the years. DBpedia Spotlight [26] combines
Named Entity Recognition (NER) and NED models based on a
vector-space representation of entities and the use of cosine sim-
ilarity for performing the disambiguation task. Hoffart et al. [19]
present AIDA which is based on the YAGO2 Knowledge Base (KB).
Gad-Elrab et al. [14] have implemented AIDA for other languages.
KEA [40] is based on a fine-granular context model that takes
into account heterogeneous text sources as well as text created by
automated multimedia analysis. Dojchinovski et al. [8] presents
Entity-classifier.eu which is based on hypernyms and a Wikipedia-
based entity classification system which identifies salient words.
The input is transformed to a lower dimensional representation
keeping the same quality of output for all sizes of input text. In
2014, Zhang et al. [49] presented x-Lisa, a three-step pipeline based
on cross-lingual Linked Data lexica that harnesses the multilingual
Wikipedia. Navigli et al. [29] proposed Babelfy, which is based on
random walks and a densest subgraph algorithm and relies on the
BabelNet semantic network [30] as background knowledge. Usbeck
et al. [44] presented AGDISTIS, a KB-agnostic entity disambiguation
approach based on string similarity measures and the graph-based
HITS algorithm. WAT [34] is the successor of TagME [11] which in-
cludes a re-design of all TagME components, namely, the spotter, the

disambiguator, and the pruner. In 2015, Consoli and Recupero [4]
presented FRED, a novel machine reader which extends TagMe with
entity typing capabilities. Zwicklbauer et al. [51] presented DoSer,
an approach akin to AGDISTIS but based on entity embeddings.
Later, Ganea et al. [15] introduced PBOH, a probabilistic graphical
model which uses pairwise Markov Random Fields. Our related
work study suggests that only three of the related approaches are
multilingual and deterministic without domain restriction. These
are VINCULUM [23], AGDISTIS [44] and QVC [48]. However, VIN-
CULUM, QVC and other recent supervised approaches [33, 38]
could not be included in our evaluation because neither their code
nor a webservice were made available publicly, and the approaches
could not be reconstructed based on the respective papers only.

3 THE MAG APPROACH
In this section, we present MAG in detail. Throughout this work,
we rely on the following formal definition of EL.

Definition 3.1. Entity Linking: Let E be a set of entities from a KB
and D be a document containing potential mentions of entities m
= (m1, . . . , mn ). The goal of an entity linking system is to generate
an assignment F of mentions to entities with F (m) ∈ (E ∪ {ϵ })n
for the document D, where ϵ stands for an entity that is not in the
KB.

The EL process implemented by MAG consists of two phases.
Several indexes are generated during the offline phase. The entity
linking per se is carried out during the online phase and consists
of two steps: 1) candidate generation and 2) disambiguation. An
overview can be found in Figure 1.

3.1 Offline Index Creation
MAG relies on the following five indexes: surface forms, person
names, rare references, acronyms and context.

Surface forms. MAG relies exclusively on structured data to
generate surface forms for entities so as to remain KB-agnostic. For
each entity in the reference KB, our approach harvests all labels
of the said entity as well as its type and indexes them.5 Additional
SFs can be collected from different sources [2, 44].

Person names - This index accounts for the variations in names
for referencing persons [21] across languages and domains. Persons
are referred to by different portions of their names. For example,
the artist Beyoncé Giselle Knowles-Carter is often referred to
as Beyoncé or Beyoncé Knowles. In Brazil, she is also known as
Beyoncé Carter and Beyoncé G. Knowles. Moreover, languages
such as Chinese and Japanese put the family name in front of the
given name (in contrast to English, where names are written in
the reverse order). We address the problem of labelling persons
by generating all possible permutations of the words within the
known labels of persons and adding them to the index of names.
Rare references - This index is created if textual descriptions
are available for the resources of interest (e.g., if resources have a
rdfs:comment property). A large number of textual entity descrip-
tions provide type information pertaining to the resource at hand,
as in the example “Michael Joseph Jackson was an American singer

5In our implementation, we relied on predicates such as rdfs:label and rdf:type.

..."6. Hence, we use a POS tagger (the Stanford POS tagger [42] in
our implementation) on the first line of a resource’s description and
collect any noun phrase that contains an adjective. For example,
we can extract the supplementary SF American singer for our
example. This is similar to [37].

Acronyms - Acronyms are used across a large number of do-
mains, e.g., in news (see AIDA and MSNBC data sets). We thus
reuse a handcrafted index from STANDS4.7

Context - Previous works[51] rely on semantic embeddings
such as Word2vec [27] to create indexes that model the words
surrounding resource mentions in textual corpora. Given that we
aim to be KB-agnostic and deterministic, our context index relies on
the Concise Bounded Description (CBD)8 of resources. The literals
found in the CBD of each resource are first freed of stop words.
Then, each preprocessed string is added as an entry that maps to
the said resource.

All necessary information for recreating our indexes or building

new indexes for other KBs can be found in our Wiki.9

3.2 Candidates Generation
The candidate generation and the disambiguation steps occur on-
line, i.e., when MAG is given a document and a set of mentions
to disambiguate. The goal of the candidate generation step is to
retrieve a tractable number of candidates for each of the mentions.
These candidates are later inserted into the disambiguation graph,
which is used to determine the mapping between entities and men-
tions (see Section 3.3).

First, we preprocess mentions to improve the retrieval qual-
ity. Before using common normalization techniques, we apply a
filter for separating acronyms. The acronym filter detects acronyms
by looking for strings made up of 5 uppercase letters or less. For
example, “PSG" is the acronym of “Paris Saint-Germain". In the
case where a mention is considered an acronym, all further prepro-
cessing steps are skipped. Otherwise, we use basic normalization
methods which remove punctuation, symbols and additional white
spaces. We use regular expressions to normalize the structure of

7See http://www.abbreviations.com/
8https://www.w3.org/Submission/CBD/
9https://github.com/AKSW/AGDISTIS/wiki/3-Running-the-webservice

strings. For example, our procedure will map strings to the lower
case except for the first letter. Therewith, “NEW YORK” is normal-
ized to “New York”. Furthermore, our preprocessing is capable of
recognizing mentions such as camel cases “AmyWinehouse" and
adds a space between lower-case and upper-case letters (i.e. true
casing technique [24]).

The second step of the candidate generation, the candidate

search, is divided into three parts:

By Acronym - If a mention is considered an acronym by our
preprocessing, we expand the mention with the list of possible
names from the acronym index mentioned above. For example,
“PSG" is replaced by “Paris Saint-Germain".

By Label - This search relies on our SF index. First, MAG re-
trieves candidates for a mention using exact matches to their respec-
tive principal reference. For example, the mention “Barack Obama"
and the principal reference of the former president of the USA,
which is also “Barack Obama", match exactly. In cases where we
find a string similarity match with the main reference of 1.0, the
remaining steps are skipped. If this search does not return any
candidates, MAG starts a new search using a trigram similarity
threshold σ over the SF index. In cases where the set of candidates
is still empty, MAG stems the mention and repeats the search. For
example, MAG stems “Northern India" to “North India" to account
for linguistic variability. The stemming process is not initialized in
the preprocessing step since it is a technique which can induce ad-
ditional errors [39]. For both search types, i.e. search by acronyms
and labels, we apply trigram similarity for retrieving possible can-
didates.

By Context - Here, we use two post-search filters to find
possible candidates from the context index. Before applying both
filters, MAG extracts all entities contained in the input document.
These entities are used as an addition while searching a mention
in the context index. This search relies on TF-IDF [35] which re-
flects the importance of a word or string in a document corpus
relative to the relevance in its index. Afterwards, MAG first filters
unlikely candidates by applying trigram similarity. Second, MAG
retrieves all direct links among the remaining candidates in the
KB. Our approach uses the number of connections to find highly
related entity sets for a specific mention. This is similar to find-
ing a dense subgraph [19]. Figure 2 illustrates an example which

we rely on HITS [20] or Page Rank [32] as disambiguation graph
algorithms. This choice comes from a comparative study of the
differences between both [7].

HITS uses hub and authority scores to define a recursive rela-
tionship between nodes. An authority node is a node that many
hubs link to and a hub is a node that links to many authorities.
The authority values are equal to the sum of the hub scores of
each node that points to it. The hub values are equal to the sum
of the authority scores of each node that it points to. According to
previous work [44], we chose 20 iterations for HITS which suffice
to achieve convergence in general.

Page Rank has a wide range of implementations. We imple-
mented the general version in accordance with [32]. Thus, we
defined the possibility of jumping from any node to any other
node in the graph during the random walk with a probability
α = (1 − w) = 0.15. We empirically chose 50 Page Rank itera-
tions which has shown to be a reasonable number for EL [51]. We
assigned a standard weight w = 0.85 for each node. Finally, the sum
is calculated by spreading the current weight divided by outgoing
edges.

Independent of the chosen graph algorithm, the highest candi-
date score among the set of candidates C is chosen as correct disam-
biguation for a given mention mi . The entire process is presented
in Algorithm 2. Note, MAG also considers emergent entities [18]
and assigns a new URI to them.11

Definition 3.3. Emergent entity: If the candidate generation step
fails to retrieve any candidate from the target KB, we assume the
mention belongs to an emergent entity.

Figure 2: Search using the context index. White boxes on the
right side depict candidates discarded by the trigram filter.

contains three ambiguous entities, namely “Angelina", “Brad" and
“Jon". Regarding the mention “Jon", MAG searches the context index
using “[(Angelina + Brad + Jon) + Jon]" as a query. MAG keeps
only “Jon_Lovitz" and “Jon_Voight" after trigram filtering. Only
“Jon_Voight", the father of “Angelina_Jolie", has direct connections
with the other candidates and is thus chosen.

To improve the quality of candidates, the popularity of a given
entity is a good ranking factor. If MAG’s configuration uses this
factor, the number of candidates retrieved from the index is in-
creased and then the result is sorted. After this sorting step, MAG
returns the top 100 candidates. The popularity is calculated us-
ing Page Rank [32] over the underlying KB. If we are unable to
leverage Page Rank on certain KB’s, we fall back to a heuristic of
inlinks and outlinks. MAG’s candidate generation process is shown
in Algorithm 1.10

3.3 Entity Disambiguation Algorithm
After the candidate generation step, the computation of the op-
timal candidate to mention assignment starts by constructing a
disambiguation graph Gd with depth d similar to the approach of
AGDISTIS.

Definition 3.2. Knowledge Base: We define KB K as a directed
graph GK = (V , E) where the nodes V are resources of K, the
edges E are properties of K and x, y ∈ V , (x, y) ∈ E ⇔ ∃p :
(x, p, y) is a triple in K.

Given the set of candidates C, we begin by building an initial
graph G0 = (V0, E0) where V0 is the set of all resources in C and
E0 = ∅. Starting with G0 the algorithm expands the graph using
Breadth-First-Search (BFS) technique in order to find hidden paths
among candidates. The extension of a graph is Gi = (Vi , Ei ) to a
graph ρ(Gi ) = Gi+1 = (Vi+1, Ei+1) with i = 0, . . . , d. The ρ (BFS)
operator iterates d times on the input graph G0 to compute the
initial disambiguation graph Gd . After constructing Gd , we need
to identify the correct candidate node for a given mention. Here,

4 EVALUATION
4.1 Goals
The aim of our evaluation is three-fold. First, we aim to measure the
performance of MAG on 17 data sets and compare it to the state of
the art for EL in English. Second, we evaluate MAG’s portability to
other languages. To this end, we compare MAG and the multilingual
state of the art using 6 data sets from different languages. For both
evaluations we use HITS and Page Rank. Third, we carry out a
fine-grained evaluation providing a deep analysis of MAG using
the method proposed in [47]. Throughout our experiments, we used
DBpedia as reference KB.

4.2 Experimental setup
For our evaluation, we rely on the GERBIL platform [45] focusing
on the Disambiguation to KB (D2KB) experiment type. The task
is to map a set of given mentions to entities from a given KB or to
ϵ (meaning the resource cannot be found in the reference KB).

All data sets (see Table 1 for an overview) are integrated into
GERBIL for the sake of comparability.12 ACE2004 originates from [36]
and is a subset of the ACE co-reference documents. The annotations
were obtained through crowd-sourcing where annotators linked
the first mention of each reference to Wikipedia. AIDA/CoNLL is
divided into 3 chunks: Training, TestA and TestB and exclusively
contains annotations based on named entities. This manually an-
notated data set was used to evaluate AIDA, and stems from the

12The TAC-KBP data sets could not be included in our evaluation because of their
redistribution license.

CoNLL 2003 shared task [41]. AQUAINT contains annotations of
the first mention of each entity in its news-wire documents [28].
Spotlight was released along with DBpedia Spotlight [26]. The
manually annotated data set contains short texts of named entities
and common entities such as cancer and home. IITB was created
in 2009 and has the highest entity/document-density of all cor-
pora [22]. KORE50’s aim is to stress test EL systems through
difficult disambiguation tasks using highly ambiguous mentions
using hand-crafted sentences.13 The Microposts 2014 data sets
were created for the "Making Sense of Microposts" challenge and
contains only tweets. MSNBC was introduced in 2007 by [5]. The
data set contains news documents with rare SF and a distinctive
lexicalization. N3 Reuters-128 comprises 128 news articles which
were sampled from the Reuters-21578 news articles data set ran-
domly and annotated manually by domain experts. N3 RSS-500
consists of data scrapped from 1,457 RSS feeds [16]. The list in-
cludes all major worldwide newspapers and a wide range of topics.
The corpus was annotated manually by domain experts. OKE 2015
was used in the OKE challenge [31]. The data sets were curated
manually and are divided into 3 subsets. N3 news.de is a real-world
data set collected from 2009 to 2011. It contains documents from
the German news portal news.de. DBpedia Abstracts is a large,
multilingual corpus generated from enriched Wikipedia data of
annotated Wikipedia abstracts from six languages [1].14

4.2.1 Results on English data sets. For this evaluation, we con-
figured MAG to disambiguate named entities as well as common
entities, to use the acronyms index and the popularity scores. Ac-
cording to [44], N-gram at letter level achieved best results when
set to 3. The σ trigram threshold was optimal at 0.8715 and varying
the depth of BFS yields an optimal choice of 2. Therefore, we tuned
the thresholds to d = 2 and σ = 0.87 for performing the evaluation
of MAG. The English results are shown in the first part of Table 2.16
An analysis of our results shows that although the acronym
index is an interesting addition for potential improvements, its
contribution amounts only to 0.05% F-measure on average over all
data sets. Also, the popularity feature improves the results in almost
every data set. It can be explained by the analysis of [47], which
demonstrates that most data sets were created using more popular
entities as mentions. Thus, this bias eases their retrieval17. HITS has
shown better results on average than Page Rank.18 However, Page
Rank did show promising results in some data sets (e.g., Spotlight
corpus, AQUAINT, and N3-RSS-500).

MAG using HITS outperformed the other approaches on 4 of
the 17 data sets while achieving comparable results on others, e.g.,
ACE2004, MSNBC, and OKE data sets.

Additionally, the performance of MAG can be easily adjusted
on each data set by tuning the parameters. For instance, MAG has
achieved on Micropost2014-test 0.45 F-measure, but the result
may increase around 22% to 0.55 F-measure by disabling the context
search.19 This improvement is due to the low entity count (1.81
entities per document) and thus missing links among entities inside
a document.

The parameter configuration works not only for huge data sets
but also for small data sets or even for disambiguating simple sen-
tences, e.g., “Michael Jordan is a basketball player and Michael
Jordan (born 1957), is an American researcher in Machine learning
and Artificial intelligence." If the co-reference resolution is turned
on, both “Michaels" are linked to the same entity (the basketball
player), but if this parameter is turned off, MAG is able to find both
correctly.

For the sake of clarity, there is no machine learning in MAG,
thus there is no cross-validation set or held-out validation while
choosing the parameters.

4.2.2 Multilingual Results. Here, we show the easy portability
and high quality of MAG for many different languages. Next to
German, Italian, Spanish, French and Dutch, we chose Japanese to
show the promising potential of MAG across different language
systems. MAG’s preprocessing NLP techniques are multilingual,
thus there is no additional implementation for handling the men-
tions with different characters. We used the same set of parameters
as in the English evaluation but excluded the acronyms as they
were only collected for English. Moreover, we performed the Page
Rank algorithm over each KB in each respective language to collect

15We chose the trigram threshold in accordance with the work of Usbeck. et al. [44]

popularity values of their entities. The results displayed in the sec-
ond part of Table 2 show that MAG, using HITS, outperformed all
publicly available state-of-the-art approaches.20 Also, Page Rank
outperformed HITS score on Dutch. The improved performance
of MAG is due to its knowledge-base agnostic algorithms and in-
dexing models. For instance, although the mention “Obama" has a
high popularity in English, it may have less popularity in Italian or
Spanish KBs. Studies about the generation of proper names support
this observation [6, 12].

4.2.3

Fine-Grained Evaluation. In this analysis, we use an ex-
tension of GERBIL done by Waitelonis et al. [47]. This extension
provides a fine-grained evaluation which measures the quality of a
given EL for linking different types of entities. This extension also
considers the assumption of Van Erp et al. [46] that a corpus has a
tendency to focus strongly on prominent or popular entities which
may cause evaluation problems. Hence, the extension evaluates
the capability of a given EL system for finding entities with differ-
ent levels of popularity thus revealing its degree of bias towards
popular entities.

For this evaluation, we used the same set of parameters as for
the English evaluation. The fine-grained analysis shows that MAG
is better at linking persons than other types of entities. This can be
explained by the indexes created by MAG in the offline phase. They
collect last names and rare surfaces for entities. In addition, the
results show that MAG is not biased towards linking only popular
entities as can be seen in Table 3.21

5 SUMMARY
We presented MAG, a KB-agnostic and deterministic approach for
multilingual EL. MAG outperforms the state of the art on all non-
English data sets. In addition, MAG achieves a performance similar
to the state of the art on English data sets. Nevertheless, an average
of 0.63 F-measure places MAG 1st out of 13 annotation systems. As
expected, machine learning-based systems retain their advantages
due to their tuned training on the provided data sets. However, we
are intrigued by our deterministic and knowledge-base independent
performance. In this paper, we analyzed the influence of different
indexing and searching methods as well as the influence of the
data set structure in a fine-grained evaluation. We also provided a
context search without relying on machine learning as previously
done. Moreover, we showed that current ML-based EL approaches
are strongly biased due to their learned model. This behavior can
be seen on multilingual data sets. We also deployed and analyzed
the influence of acronyms and last names. To the best of our knowl-
edge, no work has investigated this influence on EL and provided a
fine-grained evaluation before. In the future, we intend to further
investigate disambiguation algorithms and MAG’s performance
in biomedical and earth science domains using the same data set
from Wang et. al [48]. We also aim to evaluate MAG on different
languages such as Arabic using other data sets from [43] and export
the experiment configurations based on the MEX Vocabulary[10]
for reproducibility purposes.

ABSTRACT
Entity linking has recently been the subject of a significant body of
research. Currently, the best performing approaches rely on trained
mono-lingual models. Porting these approaches to other languages
is consequently a difficult endeavor as it requires corresponding
training data and retraining of the models. We address this draw-
back by presenting a novel multilingual, knowledge-base agnostic
and deterministic approach to entity linking, dubbed MAG. MAG
is based on a combination of context-based retrieval on structured
knowledge bases and graph algorithms. We evaluate MAG on 23
data sets and in 7 languages. Our results show that the best approach
trained on English datasets (PBOH) achieves a micro F-measure
that is up to 4 times worse on datasets in other languages. MAG on
the other hand achieves state-of-the-art performance on English
datasets and reaches a micro F-measure that is up to 0.6 higher than
that of PBOH on non-English languages.

1 INTRODUCTION
More than one exabyte of data is added to the Web every day.1
Automatic extraction of knowledge from this data demands the use
of efficient Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques such as
text aggregation, text summarization and knowledge extraction.
One of the most important NLP tasks is Entity Linking (EL), also
known as Named Entity Disambiguation (NED). The goal here is
as follows: Given a piece of text, a reference knowledge base K and
a set of entity mentions in that text, map each entity mention to
the corresponding resource in K.

Several challenges have to be addressed when dealing with EL.
For example, an entity can have a large number of surface forms (SF)
(also known as labels) due to synonymy, acronyms and typos. For
example, New York City, NY and Big Apple are all labels for the
same entity. Moreover, multiple entities can share the same name
due to homonymy and ambiguity. For example, both the state and
the city of New York are called New York. Despite the complexity of
the endeavor, EL approaches have achieved increasingly better re-
sults over the past few years by relying on trained machine learning
models (see [45] for an overview). A portion of these approaches
claim to be multilingual and rely on using cross-lingual dictionaries.
However, our experiments (see Section 4) show that the underly-
ing models being trained on English corpora make them prone to
failure when migrated to a different language. For example, while
PBOH [15] achieves an average micro F-measure of 0.69 on corpora
in English, it only achieves an average micro F-measure of 0.31 on
other languages.

We alleviate this problem by presenting MAG, a novel multi-
lingual EL approach. MAG (Multilingual AGDISTIS) is based on
concepts similar to those underlying AGDISTIS [44] but goes be-
yond this approach by relying on time-efficient graph algorithms
combined with language-independent features to link entities to a
given reference knowledge base. Hence, MAG is knowledge-base
agnostic, i.e., it can be deployed on any reference knowledge base K.
Our approach is also deterministic and does not rely on any trained
model. Hence, it can be deployed on virtually any language.

The main contributions of this paper can be summarized as

follows:

Moussallem et al.

• We present a novel multilingual and deterministic approach
for EL which combines lightweight and easily extensible
graph-based algorithms with a new context-based retrieval
method.

• MAG features an innovative candidate generation method
which relies on various filter methods and search types for
a better candidate selection.

• We provide a thorough evaluation of our overall system on
23 data sets using the GERBIL platform [45]. Our results
show that MAG achieves state-of-the-art performance on
English. In addition, MAG outperforms all state-of-the-art
approaches on 6 non-English data sets.

MAG was implemented within the AGDISTIS framework.2 The
version of MAG used in this paper and also all experimental results
are publicly available34.

2 RELATED WORK
EL approaches can be subdivided into 2 different classes: 1) English-
only approaches which are based and evaluated on English data
sets and 2) multilingual approaches.

English-only In 2013, Van Erp et al. [9] proposed an approach,
dubbed NERD-ML, for entity recognition tailored for extracting
entities from tweets. This approach relies on entity type classifi-
cation over a rich feature vector composed of a set of linguistic
components. Next to that, a plethora of other approaches including
[3, 5, 13, 17, 25, 28, 36, 50] have been developed. These approaches
mostly rely on graph algorithms and/or on machine-learning tech-
niques. However, most of them do not offer a webservice nor an
implementation that is publicly available and are thus difficult to
compare.

Multilingual A large number of multilingual approaches have
been developed over the years. DBpedia Spotlight [26] combines
Named Entity Recognition (NER) and NED models based on a
vector-space representation of entities and the use of cosine sim-
ilarity for performing the disambiguation task. Hoffart et al. [19]
present AIDA which is based on the YAGO2 Knowledge Base (KB).
Gad-Elrab et al. [14] have implemented AIDA for other languages.
KEA [40] is based on a fine-granular context model that takes
into account heterogeneous text sources as well as text created by
automated multimedia analysis. Dojchinovski et al. [8] presents
Entity-classifier.eu which is based on hypernyms and a Wikipedia-
based entity classification system which identifies salient words.
The input is transformed to a lower dimensional representation
keeping the same quality of output for all sizes of input text. In
2014, Zhang et al. [49] presented x-Lisa, a three-step pipeline based
on cross-lingual Linked Data lexica that harnesses the multilingual
Wikipedia. Navigli et al. [29] proposed Babelfy, which is based on
random walks and a densest subgraph algorithm and relies on the
BabelNet semantic network [30] as background knowledge. Usbeck
et al. [44] presented AGDISTIS, a KB-agnostic entity disambiguation
approach based on string similarity measures and the graph-based
HITS algorithm. WAT [34] is the successor of TagME [11] which in-
cludes a re-design of all TagME components, namely, the spotter, the

disambiguator, and the pruner. In 2015, Consoli and Recupero [4]
presented FRED, a novel machine reader which extends TagMe with
entity typing capabilities. Zwicklbauer et al. [51] presented DoSer,
an approach akin to AGDISTIS but based on entity embeddings.
Later, Ganea et al. [15] introduced PBOH, a probabilistic graphical
model which uses pairwise Markov Random Fields. Our related
work study suggests that only three of the related approaches are
multilingual and deterministic without domain restriction. These
are VINCULUM [23], AGDISTIS [44] and QVC [48]. However, VIN-
CULUM, QVC and other recent supervised approaches [33, 38]
could not be included in our evaluation because neither their code
nor a webservice were made available publicly, and the approaches
could not be reconstructed based on the respective papers only.

3 THE MAG APPROACH
In this section, we present MAG in detail. Throughout this work,
we rely on the following formal definition of EL.

Definition 3.1. Entity Linking: Let E be a set of entities from a KB
and D be a document containing potential mentions of entities m
= (m1, . . . , mn ). The goal of an entity linking system is to generate
an assignment F of mentions to entities with F (m) ∈ (E ∪ {ϵ })n
for the document D, where ϵ stands for an entity that is not in the
KB.

The EL process implemented by MAG consists of two phases.
Several indexes are generated during the offline phase. The entity
linking per se is carried out during the online phase and consists
of two steps: 1) candidate generation and 2) disambiguation. An
overview can be found in Figure 1.

3.1 Offline Index Creation
MAG relies on the following five indexes: surface forms, person
names, rare references, acronyms and context.

Surface forms. MAG relies exclusively on structured data to
generate surface forms for entities so as to remain KB-agnostic. For
each entity in the reference KB, our approach harvests all labels
of the said entity as well as its type and indexes them.5 Additional
SFs can be collected from different sources [2, 44].

Person names - This index accounts for the variations in names
for referencing persons [21] across languages and domains. Persons
are referred to by different portions of their names. For example,
the artist Beyoncé Giselle Knowles-Carter is often referred to
as Beyoncé or Beyoncé Knowles. In Brazil, she is also known as
Beyoncé Carter and Beyoncé G. Knowles. Moreover, languages
such as Chinese and Japanese put the family name in front of the
given name (in contrast to English, where names are written in
the reverse order). We address the problem of labelling persons
by generating all possible permutations of the words within the
known labels of persons and adding them to the index of names.
Rare references - This index is created if textual descriptions
are available for the resources of interest (e.g., if resources have a
rdfs:comment property). A large number of textual entity descrip-
tions provide type information pertaining to the resource at hand,
as in the example “Michael Joseph Jackson was an American singer

5In our implementation, we relied on predicates such as rdfs:label and rdf:type.

Figure 1: MAG architecture overview.

..."6. Hence, we use a POS tagger (the Stanford POS tagger [42] in
our implementation) on the first line of a resource’s description and
collect any noun phrase that contains an adjective. For example,
we can extract the supplementary SF American singer for our
example. This is similar to [37].

Acronyms - Acronyms are used across a large number of do-
mains, e.g., in news (see AIDA and MSNBC data sets). We thus
reuse a handcrafted index from STANDS4.7

Context - Previous works[51] rely on semantic embeddings
such as Word2vec [27] to create indexes that model the words
surrounding resource mentions in textual corpora. Given that we
aim to be KB-agnostic and deterministic, our context index relies on
the Concise Bounded Description (CBD)8 of resources. The literals
found in the CBD of each resource are first freed of stop words.
Then, each preprocessed string is added as an entry that maps to
the said resource.

All necessary information for recreating our indexes or building

new indexes for other KBs can be found in our Wiki.9

3.2 Candidates Generation
The candidate generation and the disambiguation steps occur on-
line, i.e., when MAG is given a document and a set of mentions
to disambiguate. The goal of the candidate generation step is to
retrieve a tractable number of candidates for each of the mentions.
These candidates are later inserted into the disambiguation graph,
which is used to determine the mapping between entities and men-
tions (see Section 3.3).

First, we preprocess mentions to improve the retrieval qual-
ity. Before using common normalization techniques, we apply a
filter for separating acronyms. The acronym filter detects acronyms
by looking for strings made up of 5 uppercase letters or less. For
example, “PSG" is the acronym of “Paris Saint-Germain". In the
case where a mention is considered an acronym, all further prepro-
cessing steps are skipped. Otherwise, we use basic normalization
methods which remove punctuation, symbols and additional white
spaces. We use regular expressions to normalize the structure of

7See http://www.abbreviations.com/
8https://www.w3.org/Submission/CBD/
9https://github.com/AKSW/AGDISTIS/wiki/3-Running-the-webservice

strings. For example, our procedure will map strings to the lower
case except for the first letter. Therewith, “NEW YORK” is normal-
ized to “New York”. Furthermore, our preprocessing is capable of
recognizing mentions such as camel cases “AmyWinehouse" and
adds a space between lower-case and upper-case letters (i.e. true
casing technique [24]).

The second step of the candidate generation, the candidate

search, is divided into three parts:

By Acronym - If a mention is considered an acronym by our
preprocessing, we expand the mention with the list of possible
names from the acronym index mentioned above. For example,
“PSG" is replaced by “Paris Saint-Germain".

By Label - This search relies on our SF index. First, MAG re-
trieves candidates for a mention using exact matches to their respec-
tive principal reference. For example, the mention “Barack Obama"
and the principal reference of the former president of the USA,
which is also “Barack Obama", match exactly. In cases where we
find a string similarity match with the main reference of 1.0, the
remaining steps are skipped. If this search does not return any
candidates, MAG starts a new search using a trigram similarity
threshold σ over the SF index. In cases where the set of candidates
is still empty, MAG stems the mention and repeats the search. For
example, MAG stems “Northern India" to “North India" to account
for linguistic variability. The stemming process is not initialized in
the preprocessing step since it is a technique which can induce ad-
ditional errors [39]. For both search types, i.e. search by acronyms
and labels, we apply trigram similarity for retrieving possible can-
didates.

By Context - Here, we use two post-search filters to find
possible candidates from the context index. Before applying both
filters, MAG extracts all entities contained in the input document.
These entities are used as an addition while searching a mention
in the context index. This search relies on TF-IDF [35] which re-
flects the importance of a word or string in a document corpus
relative to the relevance in its index. Afterwards, MAG first filters
unlikely candidates by applying trigram similarity. Second, MAG
retrieves all direct links among the remaining candidates in the
KB. Our approach uses the number of connections to find highly
related entity sets for a specific mention. This is similar to find-
ing a dense subgraph [19]. Figure 2 illustrates an example which

we rely on HITS [20] or Page Rank [32] as disambiguation graph
algorithms. This choice comes from a comparative study of the
differences between both [7].

HITS uses hub and authority scores to define a recursive rela-
tionship between nodes. An authority node is a node that many
hubs link to and a hub is a node that links to many authorities.
The authority values are equal to the sum of the hub scores of
each node that points to it. The hub values are equal to the sum
of the authority scores of each node that it points to. According to
previous work [44], we chose 20 iterations for HITS which suffice
to achieve convergence in general.

Page Rank has a wide range of implementations. We imple-
mented the general version in accordance with [32]. Thus, we
defined the possibility of jumping from any node to any other
node in the graph during the random walk with a probability
α = (1 − w) = 0.15. We empirically chose 50 Page Rank itera-
tions which has shown to be a reasonable number for EL [51]. We
assigned a standard weight w = 0.85 for each node. Finally, the sum
is calculated by spreading the current weight divided by outgoing
edges.

Independent of the chosen graph algorithm, the highest candi-
date score among the set of candidates C is chosen as correct disam-
biguation for a given mention mi . The entire process is presented
in Algorithm 2. Note, MAG also considers emergent entities [18]
and assigns a new URI to them.11

Definition 3.3. Emergent entity: If the candidate generation step
fails to retrieve any candidate from the target KB, we assume the
mention belongs to an emergent entity.

Figure 2: Search using the context index. White boxes on the
right side depict candidates discarded by the trigram filter.

contains three ambiguous entities, namely “Angelina", “Brad" and
“Jon". Regarding the mention “Jon", MAG searches the context index
using “[(Angelina + Brad + Jon) + Jon]" as a query. MAG keeps
only “Jon_Lovitz" and “Jon_Voight" after trigram filtering. Only
“Jon_Voight", the father of “Angelina_Jolie", has direct connections
with the other candidates and is thus chosen.

To improve the quality of candidates, the popularity of a given
entity is a good ranking factor. If MAG’s configuration uses this
factor, the number of candidates retrieved from the index is in-
creased and then the result is sorted. After this sorting step, MAG
returns the top 100 candidates. The popularity is calculated us-
ing Page Rank [32] over the underlying KB. If we are unable to
leverage Page Rank on certain KB’s, we fall back to a heuristic of
inlinks and outlinks. MAG’s candidate generation process is shown
in Algorithm 1.10

3.3 Entity Disambiguation Algorithm
After the candidate generation step, the computation of the op-
timal candidate to mention assignment starts by constructing a
disambiguation graph Gd with depth d similar to the approach of
AGDISTIS.

Definition 3.2. Knowledge Base: We define KB K as a directed
graph GK = (V , E) where the nodes V are resources of K, the
edges E are properties of K and x, y ∈ V , (x, y) ∈ E ⇔ ∃p :
(x, p, y) is a triple in K.

Given the set of candidates C, we begin by building an initial
graph G0 = (V0, E0) where V0 is the set of all resources in C and
E0 = ∅. Starting with G0 the algorithm expands the graph using
Breadth-First-Search (BFS) technique in order to find hidden paths
among candidates. The extension of a graph is Gi = (Vi , Ei ) to a
graph ρ(Gi ) = Gi+1 = (Vi+1, Ei+1) with i = 0, . . . , d. The ρ (BFS)
operator iterates d times on the input graph G0 to compute the
initial disambiguation graph Gd . After constructing Gd , we need
to identify the correct candidate node for a given mention. Here,

4 EVALUATION
4.1 Goals
The aim of our evaluation is three-fold. First, we aim to measure the
performance of MAG on 17 data sets and compare it to the state of
the art for EL in English. Second, we evaluate MAG’s portability to
other languages. To this end, we compare MAG and the multilingual
state of the art using 6 data sets from different languages. For both
evaluations we use HITS and Page Rank. Third, we carry out a
fine-grained evaluation providing a deep analysis of MAG using
the method proposed in [47]. Throughout our experiments, we used
DBpedia as reference KB.

4.2 Experimental setup
For our evaluation, we rely on the GERBIL platform [45] focusing
on the Disambiguation to KB (D2KB) experiment type. The task
is to map a set of given mentions to entities from a given KB or to
ϵ (meaning the resource cannot be found in the reference KB).

All data sets (see Table 1 for an overview) are integrated into
GERBIL for the sake of comparability.12 ACE2004 originates from [36]
and is a subset of the ACE co-reference documents. The annotations
were obtained through crowd-sourcing where annotators linked
the first mention of each reference to Wikipedia. AIDA/CoNLL is
divided into 3 chunks: Training, TestA and TestB and exclusively
contains annotations based on named entities. This manually an-
notated data set was used to evaluate AIDA, and stems from the

12The TAC-KBP data sets could not be included in our evaluation because of their
redistribution license.

CoNLL 2003 shared task [41]. AQUAINT contains annotations of
the first mention of each entity in its news-wire documents [28].
Spotlight was released along with DBpedia Spotlight [26]. The
manually annotated data set contains short texts of named entities
and common entities such as cancer and home. IITB was created
in 2009 and has the highest entity/document-density of all cor-
pora [22]. KORE50’s aim is to stress test EL systems through
difficult disambiguation tasks using highly ambiguous mentions
using hand-crafted sentences.13 The Microposts 2014 data sets
were created for the "Making Sense of Microposts" challenge and
contains only tweets. MSNBC was introduced in 2007 by [5]. The
data set contains news documents with rare SF and a distinctive
lexicalization. N3 Reuters-128 comprises 128 news articles which
were sampled from the Reuters-21578 news articles data set ran-
domly and annotated manually by domain experts. N3 RSS-500
consists of data scrapped from 1,457 RSS feeds [16]. The list in-
cludes all major worldwide newspapers and a wide range of topics.
The corpus was annotated manually by domain experts. OKE 2015
was used in the OKE challenge [31]. The data sets were curated
manually and are divided into 3 subsets. N3 news.de is a real-world
data set collected from 2009 to 2011. It contains documents from
the German news portal news.de. DBpedia Abstracts is a large,
multilingual corpus generated from enriched Wikipedia data of
annotated Wikipedia abstracts from six languages [1].14

4.2.1 Results on English data sets. For this evaluation, we con-
figured MAG to disambiguate named entities as well as common
entities, to use the acronyms index and the popularity scores. Ac-
cording to [44], N-gram at letter level achieved best results when
set to 3. The σ trigram threshold was optimal at 0.8715 and varying
the depth of BFS yields an optimal choice of 2. Therefore, we tuned
the thresholds to d = 2 and σ = 0.87 for performing the evaluation
of MAG. The English results are shown in the first part of Table 2.16
An analysis of our results shows that although the acronym
index is an interesting addition for potential improvements, its
contribution amounts only to 0.05% F-measure on average over all
data sets. Also, the popularity feature improves the results in almost
every data set. It can be explained by the analysis of [47], which
demonstrates that most data sets were created using more popular
entities as mentions. Thus, this bias eases their retrieval17. HITS has
shown better results on average than Page Rank.18 However, Page
Rank did show promising results in some data sets (e.g., Spotlight
corpus, AQUAINT, and N3-RSS-500).

MAG using HITS outperformed the other approaches on 4 of
the 17 data sets while achieving comparable results on others, e.g.,
ACE2004, MSNBC, and OKE data sets.

Additionally, the performance of MAG can be easily adjusted
on each data set by tuning the parameters. For instance, MAG has
achieved on Micropost2014-test 0.45 F-measure, but the result
may increase around 22% to 0.55 F-measure by disabling the context
search.19 This improvement is due to the low entity count (1.81
entities per document) and thus missing links among entities inside
a document.

The parameter configuration works not only for huge data sets
but also for small data sets or even for disambiguating simple sen-
tences, e.g., “Michael Jordan is a basketball player and Michael
Jordan (born 1957), is an American researcher in Machine learning
and Artificial intelligence." If the co-reference resolution is turned
on, both “Michaels" are linked to the same entity (the basketball
player), but if this parameter is turned off, MAG is able to find both
correctly.

For the sake of clarity, there is no machine learning in MAG,
thus there is no cross-validation set or held-out validation while
choosing the parameters.

4.2.2 Multilingual Results. Here, we show the easy portability
and high quality of MAG for many different languages. Next to
German, Italian, Spanish, French and Dutch, we chose Japanese to
show the promising potential of MAG across different language
systems. MAG’s preprocessing NLP techniques are multilingual,
thus there is no additional implementation for handling the men-
tions with different characters. We used the same set of parameters
as in the English evaluation but excluded the acronyms as they
were only collected for English. Moreover, we performed the Page
Rank algorithm over each KB in each respective language to collect

15We chose the trigram threshold in accordance with the work of Usbeck. et al. [44]

popularity values of their entities. The results displayed in the sec-
ond part of Table 2 show that MAG, using HITS, outperformed all
publicly available state-of-the-art approaches.20 Also, Page Rank
outperformed HITS score on Dutch. The improved performance
of MAG is due to its knowledge-base agnostic algorithms and in-
dexing models. For instance, although the mention “Obama" has a
high popularity in English, it may have less popularity in Italian or
Spanish KBs. Studies about the generation of proper names support
this observation [6, 12].

4.2.3

Fine-Grained Evaluation. In this analysis, we use an ex-
tension of GERBIL done by Waitelonis et al. [47]. This extension
provides a fine-grained evaluation which measures the quality of a
given EL for linking different types of entities. This extension also
considers the assumption of Van Erp et al. [46] that a corpus has a
tendency to focus strongly on prominent or popular entities which
may cause evaluation problems. Hence, the extension evaluates
the capability of a given EL system for finding entities with differ-
ent levels of popularity thus revealing its degree of bias towards
popular entities.

For this evaluation, we used the same set of parameters as for
the English evaluation. The fine-grained analysis shows that MAG
is better at linking persons than other types of entities. This can be
explained by the indexes created by MAG in the offline phase. They
collect last names and rare surfaces for entities. In addition, the
results show that MAG is not biased towards linking only popular
entities as can be seen in Table 3.21

5 SUMMARY
We presented MAG, a KB-agnostic and deterministic approach for
multilingual EL. MAG outperforms the state of the art on all non-
English data sets. In addition, MAG achieves a performance similar
to the state of the art on English data sets. Nevertheless, an average
of 0.63 F-measure places MAG 1st out of 13 annotation systems. As
expected, machine learning-based systems retain their advantages
due to their tuned training on the provided data sets. However, we
are intrigued by our deterministic and knowledge-base independent
performance. In this paper, we analyzed the influence of different
indexing and searching methods as well as the influence of the
data set structure in a fine-grained evaluation. We also provided a
context search without relying on machine learning as previously
done. Moreover, we showed that current ML-based EL approaches
are strongly biased due to their learned model. This behavior can
be seen on multilingual data sets. We also deployed and analyzed
the influence of acronyms and last names. To the best of our knowl-
edge, no work has investigated this influence on EL and provided a
fine-grained evaluation before. In the future, we intend to further
investigate disambiguation algorithms and MAG’s performance
in biomedical and earth science domains using the same data set
from Wang et. al [48]. We also aim to evaluate MAG on different
languages such as Arabic using other data sets from [43] and export
the experiment configurations based on the MEX Vocabulary[10]
for reproducibility purposes.

ABSTRACT
Entity linking has recently been the subject of a significant body of
research. Currently, the best performing approaches rely on trained
mono-lingual models. Porting these approaches to other languages
is consequently a difficult endeavor as it requires corresponding
training data and retraining of the models. We address this draw-
back by presenting a novel multilingual, knowledge-base agnostic
and deterministic approach to entity linking, dubbed MAG. MAG
is based on a combination of context-based retrieval on structured
knowledge bases and graph algorithms. We evaluate MAG on 23
data sets and in 7 languages. Our results show that the best approach
trained on English datasets (PBOH) achieves a micro F-measure
that is up to 4 times worse on datasets in other languages. MAG on
the other hand achieves state-of-the-art performance on English
datasets and reaches a micro F-measure that is up to 0.6 higher than
that of PBOH on non-English languages.

1 INTRODUCTION
More than one exabyte of data is added to the Web every day.1
Automatic extraction of knowledge from this data demands the use
of efficient Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques such as
text aggregation, text summarization and knowledge extraction.
One of the most important NLP tasks is Entity Linking (EL), also
known as Named Entity Disambiguation (NED). The goal here is
as follows: Given a piece of text, a reference knowledge base K and
a set of entity mentions in that text, map each entity mention to
the corresponding resource in K.

Several challenges have to be addressed when dealing with EL.
For example, an entity can have a large number of surface forms (SF)
(also known as labels) due to synonymy, acronyms and typos. For
example, New York City, NY and Big Apple are all labels for the
same entity. Moreover, multiple entities can share the same name
due to homonymy and ambiguity. For example, both the state and
the city of New York are called New York. Despite the complexity of
the endeavor, EL approaches have achieved increasingly better re-
sults over the past few years by relying on trained machine learning
models (see [45] for an overview). A portion of these approaches
claim to be multilingual and rely on using cross-lingual dictionaries.
However, our experiments (see Section 4) show that the underly-
ing models being trained on English corpora make them prone to
failure when migrated to a different language. For example, while
PBOH [15] achieves an average micro F-measure of 0.69 on corpora
in English, it only achieves an average micro F-measure of 0.31 on
other languages.

We alleviate this problem by presenting MAG, a novel multi-
lingual EL approach. MAG (Multilingual AGDISTIS) is based on
concepts similar to those underlying AGDISTIS [44] but goes be-
yond this approach by relying on time-efficient graph algorithms
combined with language-independent features to link entities to a
given reference knowledge base. Hence, MAG is knowledge-base
agnostic, i.e., it can be deployed on any reference knowledge base K.
Our approach is also deterministic and does not rely on any trained
model. Hence, it can be deployed on virtually any language.

The main contributions of this paper can be summarized as

follows:

Moussallem et al.

• We present a novel multilingual and deterministic approach
for EL which combines lightweight and easily extensible
graph-based algorithms with a new context-based retrieval
method.

• MAG features an innovative candidate generation method
which relies on various filter methods and search types for
a better candidate selection.

• We provide a thorough evaluation of our overall system on
23 data sets using the GERBIL platform [45]. Our results
show that MAG achieves state-of-the-art performance on
English. In addition, MAG outperforms all state-of-the-art
approaches on 6 non-English data sets.

MAG was implemented within the AGDISTIS framework.2 The
version of MAG used in this paper and also all experimental results
are publicly available34.

2 RELATED WORK
EL approaches can be subdivided into 2 different classes: 1) English-
only approaches which are based and evaluated on English data
sets and 2) multilingual approaches.

English-only In 2013, Van Erp et al. [9] proposed an approach,
dubbed NERD-ML, for entity recognition tailored for extracting
entities from tweets. This approach relies on entity type classifi-
cation over a rich feature vector composed of a set of linguistic
components. Next to that, a plethora of other approaches including
[3, 5, 13, 17, 25, 28, 36, 50] have been developed. These approaches
mostly rely on graph algorithms and/or on machine-learning tech-
niques. However, most of them do not offer a webservice nor an
implementation that is publicly available and are thus difficult to
compare.

Multilingual A large number of multilingual approaches have
been developed over the years. DBpedia Spotlight [26] combines
Named Entity Recognition (NER) and NED models based on a
vector-space representation of entities and the use of cosine sim-
ilarity for performing the disambiguation task. Hoffart et al. [19]
present AIDA which is based on the YAGO2 Knowledge Base (KB).
Gad-Elrab et al. [14] have implemented AIDA for other languages.
KEA [40] is based on a fine-granular context model that takes
into account heterogeneous text sources as well as text created by
automated multimedia analysis. Dojchinovski et al. [8] presents
Entity-classifier.eu which is based on hypernyms and a Wikipedia-
based entity classification system which identifies salient words.
The input is transformed to a lower dimensional representation
keeping the same quality of output for all sizes of input text. In
2014, Zhang et al. [49] presented x-Lisa, a three-step pipeline based
on cross-lingual Linked Data lexica that harnesses the multilingual
Wikipedia. Navigli et al. [29] proposed Babelfy, which is based on
random walks and a densest subgraph algorithm and relies on the
BabelNet semantic network [30] as background knowledge. Usbeck
et al. [44] presented AGDISTIS, a KB-agnostic entity disambiguation
approach based on string similarity measures and the graph-based
HITS algorithm. WAT [34] is the successor of TagME [11] which in-
cludes a re-design of all TagME components, namely, the spotter, the

disambiguator, and the pruner. In 2015, Consoli and Recupero [4]
presented FRED, a novel machine reader which extends TagMe with
entity typing capabilities. Zwicklbauer et al. [51] presented DoSer,
an approach akin to AGDISTIS but based on entity embeddings.
Later, Ganea et al. [15] introduced PBOH, a probabilistic graphical
model which uses pairwise Markov Random Fields. Our related
work study suggests that only three of the related approaches are
multilingual and deterministic without domain restriction. These
are VINCULUM [23], AGDISTIS [44] and QVC [48]. However, VIN-
CULUM, QVC and other recent supervised approaches [33, 38]
could not be included in our evaluation because neither their code
nor a webservice were made available publicly, and the approaches
could not be reconstructed based on the respective papers only.

3 THE MAG APPROACH
In this section, we present MAG in detail. Throughout this work,
we rely on the following formal definition of EL.

Definition 3.1. Entity Linking: Let E be a set of entities from a KB
and D be a document containing potential mentions of entities m
= (m1, . . . , mn ). The goal of an entity linking system is to generate
an assignment F of mentions to entities with F (m) ∈ (E ∪ {ϵ })n
for the document D, where ϵ stands for an entity that is not in the
KB.

The EL process implemented by MAG consists of two phases.
Several indexes are generated during the offline phase. The entity
linking per se is carried out during the online phase and consists
of two steps: 1) candidate generation and 2) disambiguation. An
overview can be found in Figure 1.

3.1 Offline Index Creation
MAG relies on the following five indexes: surface forms, person
names, rare references, acronyms and context.

Surface forms. MAG relies exclusively on structured data to
generate surface forms for entities so as to remain KB-agnostic. For
each entity in the reference KB, our approach harvests all labels
of the said entity as well as its type and indexes them.5 Additional
SFs can be collected from different sources [2, 44].

Person names - This index accounts for the variations in names
for referencing persons [21] across languages and domains. Persons
are referred to by different portions of their names. For example,
the artist Beyoncé Giselle Knowles-Carter is often referred to
as Beyoncé or Beyoncé Knowles. In Brazil, she is also known as
Beyoncé Carter and Beyoncé G. Knowles. Moreover, languages
such as Chinese and Japanese put the family name in front of the
given name (in contrast to English, where names are written in
the reverse order). We address the problem of labelling persons
by generating all possible permutations of the words within the
known labels of persons and adding them to the index of names.
Rare references - This index is created if textual descriptions
are available for the resources of interest (e.g., if resources have a
rdfs:comment property). A large number of textual entity descrip-
tions provide type information pertaining to the resource at hand,
as in the example “Michael Joseph Jackson was an American singer

5In our implementation, we relied on predicates such as rdfs:label and rdf:type.

..."6. Hence, we use a POS tagger (the Stanford POS tagger [42] in
our implementation) on the first line of a resource’s description and
collect any noun phrase that contains an adjective. For example,
we can extract the supplementary SF American singer for our
example. This is similar to [37].

Acronyms - Acronyms are used across a large number of do-
mains, e.g., in news (see AIDA and MSNBC data sets). We thus
reuse a handcrafted index from STANDS4.7

Context - Previous works[51] rely on semantic embeddings
such as Word2vec [27] to create indexes that model the words
surrounding resource mentions in textual corpora. Given that we
aim to be KB-agnostic and deterministic, our context index relies on
the Concise Bounded Description (CBD)8 of resources. The literals
found in the CBD of each resource are first freed of stop words.
Then, each preprocessed string is added as an entry that maps to
the said resource.

All necessary information for recreating our indexes or building

new indexes for other KBs can be found in our Wiki.9

3.2 Candidates Generation
The candidate generation and the disambiguation steps occur on-
line, i.e., when MAG is given a document and a set of mentions
to disambiguate. The goal of the candidate generation step is to
retrieve a tractable number of candidates for each of the mentions.
These candidates are later inserted into the disambiguation graph,
which is used to determine the mapping between entities and men-
tions (see Section 3.3).

First, we preprocess mentions to improve the retrieval qual-
ity. Before using common normalization techniques, we apply a
filter for separating acronyms. The acronym filter detects acronyms
by looking for strings made up of 5 uppercase letters or less. For
example, “PSG" is the acronym of “Paris Saint-Germain". In the
case where a mention is considered an acronym, all further prepro-
cessing steps are skipped. Otherwise, we use basic normalization
methods which remove punctuation, symbols and additional white
spaces. We use regular expressions to normalize the structure of

7See http://www.abbreviations.com/
8https://www.w3.org/Submission/CBD/
9https://github.com/AKSW/AGDISTIS/wiki/3-Running-the-webservice

strings. For example, our procedure will map strings to the lower
case except for the first letter. Therewith, “NEW YORK” is normal-
ized to “New York”. Furthermore, our preprocessing is capable of
recognizing mentions such as camel cases “AmyWinehouse" and
adds a space between lower-case and upper-case letters (i.e. true
casing technique [24]).

The second step of the candidate generation, the candidate

search, is divided into three parts:

By Acronym - If a mention is considered an acronym by our
preprocessing, we expand the mention with the list of possible
names from the acronym index mentioned above. For example,
“PSG" is replaced by “Paris Saint-Germain".

By Label - This search relies on our SF index. First, MAG re-
trieves candidates for a mention using exact matches to their respec-
tive principal reference. For example, the mention “Barack Obama"
and the principal reference of the former president of the USA,
which is also “Barack Obama", match exactly. In cases where we
find a string similarity match with the main reference of 1.0, the
remaining steps are skipped. If this search does not return any
candidates, MAG starts a new search using a trigram similarity
threshold σ over the SF index. In cases where the set of candidates
is still empty, MAG stems the mention and repeats the search. For
example, MAG stems “Northern India" to “North India" to account
for linguistic variability. The stemming process is not initialized in
the preprocessing step since it is a technique which can induce ad-
ditional errors [39]. For both search types, i.e. search by acronyms
and labels, we apply trigram similarity for retrieving possible can-
didates.

By Context - Here, we use two post-search filters to find
possible candidates from the context index. Before applying both
filters, MAG extracts all entities contained in the input document.
These entities are used as an addition while searching a mention
in the context index. This search relies on TF-IDF [35] which re-
flects the importance of a word or string in a document corpus
relative to the relevance in its index. Afterwards, MAG first filters
unlikely candidates by applying trigram similarity. Second, MAG
retrieves all direct links among the remaining candidates in the
KB. Our approach uses the number of connections to find highly
related entity sets for a specific mention. This is similar to find-
ing a dense subgraph [19]. Figure 2 illustrates an example which

we rely on HITS [20] or Page Rank [32] as disambiguation graph
algorithms. This choice comes from a comparative study of the
differences between both [7].

HITS uses hub and authority scores to define a recursive rela-
tionship between nodes. An authority node is a node that many
hubs link to and a hub is a node that links to many authorities.
The authority values are equal to the sum of the hub scores of
each node that points to it. The hub values are equal to the sum
of the authority scores of each node that it points to. According to
previous work [44], we chose 20 iterations for HITS which suffice
to achieve convergence in general.

Page Rank has a wide range of implementations. We imple-
mented the general version in accordance with [32]. Thus, we
defined the possibility of jumping from any node to any other
node in the graph during the random walk with a probability
α = (1 − w) = 0.15. We empirically chose 50 Page Rank itera-
tions which has shown to be a reasonable number for EL [51]. We
assigned a standard weight w = 0.85 for each node. Finally, the sum
is calculated by spreading the current weight divided by outgoing
edges.

Independent of the chosen graph algorithm, the highest candi-
date score among the set of candidates C is chosen as correct disam-
biguation for a given mention mi . The entire process is presented
in Algorithm 2. Note, MAG also considers emergent entities [18]
and assigns a new URI to them.11

Definition 3.3. Emergent entity: If the candidate generation step
fails to retrieve any candidate from the target KB, we assume the
mention belongs to an emergent entity.

Figure 2: Search using the context index. White boxes on the
right side depict candidates discarded by the trigram filter.

contains three ambiguous entities, namely “Angelina", “Brad" and
“Jon". Regarding the mention “Jon", MAG searches the context index
using “[(Angelina + Brad + Jon) + Jon]" as a query. MAG keeps
only “Jon_Lovitz" and “Jon_Voight" after trigram filtering. Only
“Jon_Voight", the father of “Angelina_Jolie", has direct connections
with the other candidates and is thus chosen.

To improve the quality of candidates, the popularity of a given
entity is a good ranking factor. If MAG’s configuration uses this
factor, the number of candidates retrieved from the index is in-
creased and then the result is sorted. After this sorting step, MAG
returns the top 100 candidates. The popularity is calculated us-
ing Page Rank [32] over the underlying KB. If we are unable to
leverage Page Rank on certain KB’s, we fall back to a heuristic of
inlinks and outlinks. MAG’s candidate generation process is shown
in Algorithm 1.10

3.3 Entity Disambiguation Algorithm
After the candidate generation step, the computation of the op-
timal candidate to mention assignment starts by constructing a
disambiguation graph Gd with depth d similar to the approach of
AGDISTIS.

Definition 3.2. Knowledge Base: We define KB K as a directed
graph GK = (V , E) where the nodes V are resources of K, the
edges E are properties of K and x, y ∈ V , (x, y) ∈ E ⇔ ∃p :
(x, p, y) is a triple in K.

Given the set of candidates C, we begin by building an initial
graph G0 = (V0, E0) where V0 is the set of all resources in C and
E0 = ∅. Starting with G0 the algorithm expands the graph using
Breadth-First-Search (BFS) technique in order to find hidden paths
among candidates. The extension of a graph is Gi = (Vi , Ei ) to a
graph ρ(Gi ) = Gi+1 = (Vi+1, Ei+1) with i = 0, . . . , d. The ρ (BFS)
operator iterates d times on the input graph G0 to compute the
initial disambiguation graph Gd . After constructing Gd , we need
to identify the correct candidate node for a given mention. Here,

4 EVALUATION
4.1 Goals
The aim of our evaluation is three-fold. First, we aim to measure the
performance of MAG on 17 data sets and compare it to the state of
the art for EL in English. Second, we evaluate MAG’s portability to
other languages. To this end, we compare MAG and the multilingual
state of the art using 6 data sets from different languages. For both
evaluations we use HITS and Page Rank. Third, we carry out a
fine-grained evaluation providing a deep analysis of MAG using
the method proposed in [47]. Throughout our experiments, we used
DBpedia as reference KB.

4.2 Experimental setup
For our evaluation, we rely on the GERBIL platform [45] focusing
on the Disambiguation to KB (D2KB) experiment type. The task
is to map a set of given mentions to entities from a given KB or to
ϵ (meaning the resource cannot be found in the reference KB).

All data sets (see Table 1 for an overview) are integrated into
GERBIL for the sake of comparability.12 ACE2004 originates from [36]
and is a subset of the ACE co-reference documents. The annotations
were obtained through crowd-sourcing where annotators linked
the first mention of each reference to Wikipedia. AIDA/CoNLL is
divided into 3 chunks: Training, TestA and TestB and exclusively
contains annotations based on named entities. This manually an-
notated data set was used to evaluate AIDA, and stems from the

12The TAC-KBP data sets could not be included in our evaluation because of their
redistribution license.

CoNLL 2003 shared task [41]. AQUAINT contains annotations of
the first mention of each entity in its news-wire documents [28].
Spotlight was released along with DBpedia Spotlight [26]. The
manually annotated data set contains short texts of named entities
and common entities such as cancer and home. IITB was created
in 2009 and has the highest entity/document-density of all cor-
pora [22]. KORE50’s aim is to stress test EL systems through
difficult disambiguation tasks using highly ambiguous mentions
using hand-crafted sentences.13 The Microposts 2014 data sets
were created for the "Making Sense of Microposts" challenge and
contains only tweets. MSNBC was introduced in 2007 by [5]. The
data set contains news documents with rare SF and a distinctive
lexicalization. N3 Reuters-128 comprises 128 news articles which
were sampled from the Reuters-21578 news articles data set ran-
domly and annotated manually by domain experts. N3 RSS-500
consists of data scrapped from 1,457 RSS feeds [16]. The list in-
cludes all major worldwide newspapers and a wide range of topics.
The corpus was annotated manually by domain experts. OKE 2015
was used in the OKE challenge [31]. The data sets were curated
manually and are divided into 3 subsets. N3 news.de is a real-world
data set collected from 2009 to 2011. It contains documents from
the German news portal news.de. DBpedia Abstracts is a large,
multilingual corpus generated from enriched Wikipedia data of
annotated Wikipedia abstracts from six languages [1].14

4.2.1 Results on English data sets. For this evaluation, we con-
figured MAG to disambiguate named entities as well as common
entities, to use the acronyms index and the popularity scores. Ac-
cording to [44], N-gram at letter level achieved best results when
set to 3. The σ trigram threshold was optimal at 0.8715 and varying
the depth of BFS yields an optimal choice of 2. Therefore, we tuned
the thresholds to d = 2 and σ = 0.87 for performing the evaluation
of MAG. The English results are shown in the first part of Table 2.16
An analysis of our results shows that although the acronym
index is an interesting addition for potential improvements, its
contribution amounts only to 0.05% F-measure on average over all
data sets. Also, the popularity feature improves the results in almost
every data set. It can be explained by the analysis of [47], which
demonstrates that most data sets were created using more popular
entities as mentions. Thus, this bias eases their retrieval17. HITS has
shown better results on average than Page Rank.18 However, Page
Rank did show promising results in some data sets (e.g., Spotlight
corpus, AQUAINT, and N3-RSS-500).

MAG using HITS outperformed the other approaches on 4 of
the 17 data sets while achieving comparable results on others, e.g.,
ACE2004, MSNBC, and OKE data sets.

Additionally, the performance of MAG can be easily adjusted
on each data set by tuning the parameters. For instance, MAG has
achieved on Micropost2014-test 0.45 F-measure, but the result
may increase around 22% to 0.55 F-measure by disabling the context
search.19 This improvement is due to the low entity count (1.81
entities per document) and thus missing links among entities inside
a document.

The parameter configuration works not only for huge data sets
but also for small data sets or even for disambiguating simple sen-
tences, e.g., “Michael Jordan is a basketball player and Michael
Jordan (born 1957), is an American researcher in Machine learning
and Artificial intelligence." If the co-reference resolution is turned
on, both “Michaels" are linked to the same entity (the basketball
player), but if this parameter is turned off, MAG is able to find both
correctly.

For the sake of clarity, there is no machine learning in MAG,
thus there is no cross-validation set or held-out validation while
choosing the parameters.

4.2.2 Multilingual Results. Here, we show the easy portability
and high quality of MAG for many different languages. Next to
German, Italian, Spanish, French and Dutch, we chose Japanese to
show the promising potential of MAG across different language
systems. MAG’s preprocessing NLP techniques are multilingual,
thus there is no additional implementation for handling the men-
tions with different characters. We used the same set of parameters
as in the English evaluation but excluded the acronyms as they
were only collected for English. Moreover, we performed the Page
Rank algorithm over each KB in each respective language to collect

15We chose the trigram threshold in accordance with the work of Usbeck. et al. [44]

popularity values of their entities. The results displayed in the sec-
ond part of Table 2 show that MAG, using HITS, outperformed all
publicly available state-of-the-art approaches.20 Also, Page Rank
outperformed HITS score on Dutch. The improved performance
of MAG is due to its knowledge-base agnostic algorithms and in-
dexing models. For instance, although the mention “Obama" has a
high popularity in English, it may have less popularity in Italian or
Spanish KBs. Studies about the generation of proper names support
this observation [6, 12].

4.2.3

Fine-Grained Evaluation. In this analysis, we use an ex-
tension of GERBIL done by Waitelonis et al. [47]. This extension
provides a fine-grained evaluation which measures the quality of a
given EL for linking different types of entities. This extension also
considers the assumption of Van Erp et al. [46] that a corpus has a
tendency to focus strongly on prominent or popular entities which
may cause evaluation problems. Hence, the extension evaluates
the capability of a given EL system for finding entities with differ-
ent levels of popularity thus revealing its degree of bias towards
popular entities.

For this evaluation, we used the same set of parameters as for
the English evaluation. The fine-grained analysis shows that MAG
is better at linking persons than other types of entities. This can be
explained by the indexes created by MAG in the offline phase. They
collect last names and rare surfaces for entities. In addition, the
results show that MAG is not biased towards linking only popular
entities as can be seen in Table 3.21

5 SUMMARY
We presented MAG, a KB-agnostic and deterministic approach for
multilingual EL. MAG outperforms the state of the art on all non-
English data sets. In addition, MAG achieves a performance similar
to the state of the art on English data sets. Nevertheless, an average
of 0.63 F-measure places MAG 1st out of 13 annotation systems. As
expected, machine learning-based systems retain their advantages
due to their tuned training on the provided data sets. However, we
are intrigued by our deterministic and knowledge-base independent
performance. In this paper, we analyzed the influence of different
indexing and searching methods as well as the influence of the
data set structure in a fine-grained evaluation. We also provided a
context search without relying on machine learning as previously
done. Moreover, we showed that current ML-based EL approaches
are strongly biased due to their learned model. This behavior can
be seen on multilingual data sets. We also deployed and analyzed
the influence of acronyms and last names. To the best of our knowl-
edge, no work has investigated this influence on EL and provided a
fine-grained evaluation before. In the future, we intend to further
investigate disambiguation algorithms and MAG’s performance
in biomedical and earth science domains using the same data set
from Wang et. al [48]. We also aim to evaluate MAG on different
languages such as Arabic using other data sets from [43] and export
the experiment configurations based on the MEX Vocabulary[10]
for reproducibility purposes.

ABSTRACT
Entity linking has recently been the subject of a significant body of
research. Currently, the best performing approaches rely on trained
mono-lingual models. Porting these approaches to other languages
is consequently a difficult endeavor as it requires corresponding
training data and retraining of the models. We address this draw-
back by presenting a novel multilingual, knowledge-base agnostic
and deterministic approach to entity linking, dubbed MAG. MAG
is based on a combination of context-based retrieval on structured
knowledge bases and graph algorithms. We evaluate MAG on 23
data sets and in 7 languages. Our results show that the best approach
trained on English datasets (PBOH) achieves a micro F-measure
that is up to 4 times worse on datasets in other languages. MAG on
the other hand achieves state-of-the-art performance on English
datasets and reaches a micro F-measure that is up to 0.6 higher than
that of PBOH on non-English languages.

1 INTRODUCTION
More than one exabyte of data is added to the Web every day.1
Automatic extraction of knowledge from this data demands the use
of efficient Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques such as
text aggregation, text summarization and knowledge extraction.
One of the most important NLP tasks is Entity Linking (EL), also
known as Named Entity Disambiguation (NED). The goal here is
as follows: Given a piece of text, a reference knowledge base K and
a set of entity mentions in that text, map each entity mention to
the corresponding resource in K.

Several challenges have to be addressed when dealing with EL.
For example, an entity can have a large number of surface forms (SF)
(also known as labels) due to synonymy, acronyms and typos. For
example, New York City, NY and Big Apple are all labels for the
same entity. Moreover, multiple entities can share the same name
due to homonymy and ambiguity. For example, both the state and
the city of New York are called New York. Despite the complexity of
the endeavor, EL approaches have achieved increasingly better re-
sults over the past few years by relying on trained machine learning
models (see [45] for an overview). A portion of these approaches
claim to be multilingual and rely on using cross-lingual dictionaries.
However, our experiments (see Section 4) show that the underly-
ing models being trained on English corpora make them prone to
failure when migrated to a different language. For example, while
PBOH [15] achieves an average micro F-measure of 0.69 on corpora
in English, it only achieves an average micro F-measure of 0.31 on
other languages.

We alleviate this problem by presenting MAG, a novel multi-
lingual EL approach. MAG (Multilingual AGDISTIS) is based on
concepts similar to those underlying AGDISTIS [44] but goes be-
yond this approach by relying on time-efficient graph algorithms
combined with language-independent features to link entities to a
given reference knowledge base. Hence, MAG is knowledge-base
agnostic, i.e., it can be deployed on any reference knowledge base K.
Our approach is also deterministic and does not rely on any trained
model. Hence, it can be deployed on virtually any language.

The main contributions of this paper can be summarized as

follows:

Moussallem et al.

• We present a novel multilingual and deterministic approach
for EL which combines lightweight and easily extensible
graph-based algorithms with a new context-based retrieval
method.

• MAG features an innovative candidate generation method
which relies on various filter methods and search types for
a better candidate selection.

• We provide a thorough evaluation of our overall system on
23 data sets using the GERBIL platform [45]. Our results
show that MAG achieves state-of-the-art performance on
English. In addition, MAG outperforms all state-of-the-art
approaches on 6 non-English data sets.

MAG was implemented within the AGDISTIS framework.2 The
version of MAG used in this paper and also all experimental results
are publicly available34.

2 RELATED WORK
EL approaches can be subdivided into 2 different classes: 1) English-
only approaches which are based and evaluated on English data
sets and 2) multilingual approaches.

English-only In 2013, Van Erp et al. [9] proposed an approach,
dubbed NERD-ML, for entity recognition tailored for extracting
entities from tweets. This approach relies on entity type classifi-
cation over a rich feature vector composed of a set of linguistic
components. Next to that, a plethora of other approaches including
[3, 5, 13, 17, 25, 28, 36, 50] have been developed. These approaches
mostly rely on graph algorithms and/or on machine-learning tech-
niques. However, most of them do not offer a webservice nor an
implementation that is publicly available and are thus difficult to
compare.

Multilingual A large number of multilingual approaches have
been developed over the years. DBpedia Spotlight [26] combines
Named Entity Recognition (NER) and NED models based on a
vector-space representation of entities and the use of cosine sim-
ilarity for performing the disambiguation task. Hoffart et al. [19]
present AIDA which is based on the YAGO2 Knowledge Base (KB).
Gad-Elrab et al. [14] have implemented AIDA for other languages.
KEA [40] is based on a fine-granular context model that takes
into account heterogeneous text sources as well as text created by
automated multimedia analysis. Dojchinovski et al. [8] presents
Entity-classifier.eu which is based on hypernyms and a Wikipedia-
based entity classification system which identifies salient words.
The input is transformed to a lower dimensional representation
keeping the same quality of output for all sizes of input text. In
2014, Zhang et al. [49] presented x-Lisa, a three-step pipeline based
on cross-lingual Linked Data lexica that harnesses the multilingual
Wikipedia. Navigli et al. [29] proposed Babelfy, which is based on
random walks and a densest subgraph algorithm and relies on the
BabelNet semantic network [30] as background knowledge. Usbeck
et al. [44] presented AGDISTIS, a KB-agnostic entity disambiguation
approach based on string similarity measures and the graph-based
HITS algorithm. WAT [34] is the successor of TagME [11] which in-
cludes a re-design of all TagME components, namely, the spotter, the

disambiguator, and the pruner. In 2015, Consoli and Recupero [4]
presented FRED, a novel machine reader which extends TagMe with
entity typing capabilities. Zwicklbauer et al. [51] presented DoSer,
an approach akin to AGDISTIS but based on entity embeddings.
Later, Ganea et al. [15] introduced PBOH, a probabilistic graphical
model which uses pairwise Markov Random Fields. Our related
work study suggests that only three of the related approaches are
multilingual and deterministic without domain restriction. These
are VINCULUM [23], AGDISTIS [44] and QVC [48]. However, VIN-
CULUM, QVC and other recent supervised approaches [33, 38]
could not be included in our evaluation because neither their code
nor a webservice were made available publicly, and the approaches
could not be reconstructed based on the respective papers only.

3 THE MAG APPROACH
In this section, we present MAG in detail. Throughout this work,
we rely on the following formal definition of EL.

Definition 3.1. Entity Linking: Let E be a set of entities from a KB
and D be a document containing potential mentions of entities m
= (m1, . . . , mn ). The goal of an entity linking system is to generate
an assignment F of mentions to entities with F (m) ∈ (E ∪ {ϵ })n
for the document D, where ϵ stands for an entity that is not in the
KB.

The EL process implemented by MAG consists of two phases.
Several indexes are generated during the offline phase. The entity
linking per se is carried out during the online phase and consists
of two steps: 1) candidate generation and 2) disambiguation. An
overview can be found in Figure 1.

3.1 Offline Index Creation
MAG relies on the following five indexes: surface forms, person
names, rare references, acronyms and context.

Surface forms. MAG relies exclusively on structured data to
generate surface forms for entities so as to remain KB-agnostic. For
each entity in the reference KB, our approach harvests all labels
of the said entity as well as its type and indexes them.5 Additional
SFs can be collected from different sources [2, 44].

Person names - This index accounts for the variations in names
for referencing persons [21] across languages and domains. Persons
are referred to by different portions of their names. For example,
the artist Beyoncé Giselle Knowles-Carter is often referred to
as Beyoncé or Beyoncé Knowles. In Brazil, she is also known as
Beyoncé Carter and Beyoncé G. Knowles. Moreover, languages
such as Chinese and Japanese put the family name in front of the
given name (in contrast to English, where names are written in
the reverse order). We address the problem of labelling persons
by generating all possible permutations of the words within the
known labels of persons and adding them to the index of names.
Rare references - This index is created if textual descriptions
are available for the resources of interest (e.g., if resources have a
rdfs:comment property). A large number of textual entity descrip-
tions provide type information pertaining to the resource at hand,
as in the example “Michael Joseph Jackson was an American singer

5In our implementation, we relied on predicates such as rdfs:label and rdf:type.

..."6. Hence, we use a POS tagger (the Stanford POS tagger [42] in
our implementation) on the first line of a resource’s description and
collect any noun phrase that contains an adjective. For example,
we can extract the supplementary SF American singer for our
example. This is similar to [37].

Acronyms - Acronyms are used across a large number of do-
mains, e.g., in news (see AIDA and MSNBC data sets). We thus
reuse a handcrafted index from STANDS4.7

Context - Previous works[51] rely on semantic embeddings
such as Word2vec [27] to create indexes that model the words
surrounding resource mentions in textual corpora. Given that we
aim to be KB-agnostic and deterministic, our context index relies on
the Concise Bounded Description (CBD)8 of resources. The literals
found in the CBD of each resource are first freed of stop words.
Then, each preprocessed string is added as an entry that maps to
the said resource.

All necessary information for recreating our indexes or building

new indexes for other KBs can be found in our Wiki.9

3.2 Candidates Generation
The candidate generation and the disambiguation steps occur on-
line, i.e., when MAG is given a document and a set of mentions
to disambiguate. The goal of the candidate generation step is to
retrieve a tractable number of candidates for each of the mentions.
These candidates are later inserted into the disambiguation graph,
which is used to determine the mapping between entities and men-
tions (see Section 3.3).

First, we preprocess mentions to improve the retrieval qual-
ity. Before using common normalization techniques, we apply a
filter for separating acronyms. The acronym filter detects acronyms
by looking for strings made up of 5 uppercase letters or less. For
example, “PSG" is the acronym of “Paris Saint-Germain". In the
case where a mention is considered an acronym, all further prepro-
cessing steps are skipped. Otherwise, we use basic normalization
methods which remove punctuation, symbols and additional white
spaces. We use regular expressions to normalize the structure of

7See http://www.abbreviations.com/
8https://www.w3.org/Submission/CBD/
9https://github.com/AKSW/AGDISTIS/wiki/3-Running-the-webservice

strings. For example, our procedure will map strings to the lower
case except for the first letter. Therewith, “NEW YORK” is normal-
ized to “New York”. Furthermore, our preprocessing is capable of
recognizing mentions such as camel cases “AmyWinehouse" and
adds a space between lower-case and upper-case letters (i.e. true
casing technique [24]).

The second step of the candidate generation, the candidate

search, is divided into three parts:

By Acronym - If a mention is considered an acronym by our
preprocessing, we expand the mention with the list of possible
names from the acronym index mentioned above. For example,
“PSG" is replaced by “Paris Saint-Germain".

By Label - This search relies on our SF index. First, MAG re-
trieves candidates for a mention using exact matches to their respec-
tive principal reference. For example, the mention “Barack Obama"
and the principal reference of the former president of the USA,
which is also “Barack Obama", match exactly. In cases where we
find a string similarity match with the main reference of 1.0, the
remaining steps are skipped. If this search does not return any
candidates, MAG starts a new search using a trigram similarity
threshold σ over the SF index. In cases where the set of candidates
is still empty, MAG stems the mention and repeats the search. For
example, MAG stems “Northern India" to “North India" to account
for linguistic variability. The stemming process is not initialized in
the preprocessing step since it is a technique which can induce ad-
ditional errors [39]. For both search types, i.e. search by acronyms
and labels, we apply trigram similarity for retrieving possible can-
didates.

By Context - Here, we use two post-search filters to find
possible candidates from the context index. Before applying both
filters, MAG extracts all entities contained in the input document.
These entities are used as an addition while searching a mention
in the context index. This search relies on TF-IDF [35] which re-
flects the importance of a word or string in a document corpus
relative to the relevance in its index. Afterwards, MAG first filters
unlikely candidates by applying trigram similarity. Second, MAG
retrieves all direct links among the remaining candidates in the
KB. Our approach uses the number of connections to find highly
related entity sets for a specific mention. This is similar to find-
ing a dense subgraph [19]. Figure 2 illustrates an example which

we rely on HITS [20] or Page Rank [32] as disambiguation graph
algorithms. This choice comes from a comparative study of the
differences between both [7].

HITS uses hub and authority scores to define a recursive rela-
tionship between nodes. An authority node is a node that many
hubs link to and a hub is a node that links to many authorities.
The authority values are equal to the sum of the hub scores of
each node that points to it. The hub values are equal to the sum
of the authority scores of each node that it points to. According to
previous work [44], we chose 20 iterations for HITS which suffice
to achieve convergence in general.

Page Rank has a wide range of implementations. We imple-
mented the general version in accordance with [32]. Thus, we
defined the possibility of jumping from any node to any other
node in the graph during the random walk with a probability
α = (1 − w) = 0.15. We empirically chose 50 Page Rank itera-
tions which has shown to be a reasonable number for EL [51]. We
assigned a standard weight w = 0.85 for each node. Finally, the sum
is calculated by spreading the current weight divided by outgoing
edges.

Independent of the chosen graph algorithm, the highest candi-
date score among the set of candidates C is chosen as correct disam-
biguation for a given mention mi . The entire process is presented
in Algorithm 2. Note, MAG also considers emergent entities [18]
and assigns a new URI to them.11

Definition 3.3. Emergent entity: If the candidate generation step
fails to retrieve any candidate from the target KB, we assume the
mention belongs to an emergent entity.

Figure 2: Search using the context index. White boxes on the
right side depict candidates discarded by the trigram filter.

contains three ambiguous entities, namely “Angelina", “Brad" and
“Jon". Regarding the mention “Jon", MAG searches the context index
using “[(Angelina + Brad + Jon) + Jon]" as a query. MAG keeps
only “Jon_Lovitz" and “Jon_Voight" after trigram filtering. Only
“Jon_Voight", the father of “Angelina_Jolie", has direct connections
with the other candidates and is thus chosen.

To improve the quality of candidates, the popularity of a given
entity is a good ranking factor. If MAG’s configuration uses this
factor, the number of candidates retrieved from the index is in-
creased and then the result is sorted. After this sorting step, MAG
returns the top 100 candidates. The popularity is calculated us-
ing Page Rank [32] over the underlying KB. If we are unable to
leverage Page Rank on certain KB’s, we fall back to a heuristic of
inlinks and outlinks. MAG’s candidate generation process is shown
in Algorithm 1.10

3.3 Entity Disambiguation Algorithm
After the candidate generation step, the computation of the op-
timal candidate to mention assignment starts by constructing a
disambiguation graph Gd with depth d similar to the approach of
AGDISTIS.

Definition 3.2. Knowledge Base: We define KB K as a directed
graph GK = (V , E) where the nodes V are resources of K, the
edges E are properties of K and x, y ∈ V , (x, y) ∈ E ⇔ ∃p :
(x, p, y) is a triple in K.

Given the set of candidates C, we begin by building an initial
graph G0 = (V0, E0) where V0 is the set of all resources in C and
E0 = ∅. Starting with G0 the algorithm expands the graph using
Breadth-First-Search (BFS) technique in order to find hidden paths
among candidates. The extension of a graph is Gi = (Vi , Ei ) to a
graph ρ(Gi ) = Gi+1 = (Vi+1, Ei+1) with i = 0, . . . , d. The ρ (BFS)
operator iterates d times on the input graph G0 to compute the
initial disambiguation graph Gd . After constructing Gd , we need
to identify the correct candidate node for a given mention. Here,

4 EVALUATION
4.1 Goals
The aim of our evaluation is three-fold. First, we aim to measure the
performance of MAG on 17 data sets and compare it to the state of
the art for EL in English. Second, we evaluate MAG’s portability to
other languages. To this end, we compare MAG and the multilingual
state of the art using 6 data sets from different languages. For both
evaluations we use HITS and Page Rank. Third, we carry out a
fine-grained evaluation providing a deep analysis of MAG using
the method proposed in [47]. Throughout our experiments, we used
DBpedia as reference KB.

4.2 Experimental setup
For our evaluation, we rely on the GERBIL platform [45] focusing
on the Disambiguation to KB (D2KB) experiment type. The task
is to map a set of given mentions to entities from a given KB or to
ϵ (meaning the resource cannot be found in the reference KB).

All data sets (see Table 1 for an overview) are integrated into
GERBIL for the sake of comparability.12 ACE2004 originates from [36]
and is a subset of the ACE co-reference documents. The annotations
were obtained through crowd-sourcing where annotators linked
the first mention of each reference to Wikipedia. AIDA/CoNLL is
divided into 3 chunks: Training, TestA and TestB and exclusively
contains annotations based on named entities. This manually an-
notated data set was used to evaluate AIDA, and stems from the

redistribution license.

CoNLL 2003 shared task [41]. AQUAINT contains annotations of
the first mention of each entity in its news-wire documents [28].
Spotlight was released along with DBpedia Spotlight [26]. The
manually annotated data set contains short texts of named entities
and common entities such as cancer and home. IITB was created
in 2009 and has the highest entity/document-density of all cor-
pora [22]. KORE50’s aim is to stress test EL systems through
difficult disambiguation tasks using highly ambiguous mentions
using hand-crafted sentences.13 The Microposts 2014 data sets
were created for the "Making Sense of Microposts" challenge and
contains only tweets. MSNBC was introduced in 2007 by [5]. The
data set contains news documents with rare SF and a distinctive
lexicalization. N3 Reuters-128 comprises 128 news articles which
were sampled from the Reuters-21578 news articles data set ran-
domly and annotated manually by domain experts. N3 RSS-500
consists of data scrapped from 1,457 RSS feeds [16]. The list in-
cludes all major worldwide newspapers and a wide range of topics.
The corpus was annotated manually by domain experts. OKE 2015
was used in the OKE challenge [31]. The data sets were curated
manually and are divided into 3 subsets. N3 news.de is a real-world
data set collected from 2009 to 2011. It contains documents from
the German news portal news.de. DBpedia Abstracts is a large,
multilingual corpus generated from enriched Wikipedia data of
annotated Wikipedia abstracts from six languages [1].14

4.2.1 Results on English data sets. For this evaluation, we con-
figured MAG to disambiguate named entities as well as common
entities, to use the acronyms index and the popularity scores. Ac-
cording to [44], N-gram at letter level achieved best results when
set to 3. The σ trigram threshold was optimal at 0.8715 and varying
the depth of BFS yields an optimal choice of 2. Therefore, we tuned
the thresholds to d = 2 and σ = 0.87 for performing the evaluation
of MAG. The English results are shown in the first part of Table 2.16
An analysis of our results shows that although the acronym
index is an interesting addition for potential improvements, its
contribution amounts only to 0.05% F-measure on average over all
data sets. Also, the popularity feature improves the results in almost
every data set. It can be explained by the analysis of [47], which
demonstrates that most data sets were created using more popular
entities as mentions. Thus, this bias eases their retrieval17. HITS has
shown better results on average than Page Rank.18 However, Page
Rank did show promising results in some data sets (e.g., Spotlight
corpus, AQUAINT, and N3-RSS-500).

MAG using HITS outperformed the other approaches on 4 of
the 17 data sets while achieving comparable results on others, e.g.,
ACE2004, MSNBC, and OKE data sets.

Additionally, the performance of MAG can be easily adjusted
on each data set by tuning the parameters. For instance, MAG has
achieved on Micropost2014-test 0.45 F-measure, but the result
may increase around 22% to 0.55 F-measure by disabling the context
search.19 This improvement is due to the low entity count (1.81
entities per document) and thus missing links among entities inside
a document.

The parameter configuration works not only for huge data sets
but also for small data sets or even for disambiguating simple sen-
tences, e.g., “Michael Jordan is a basketball player and Michael
Jordan (born 1957), is an American researcher in Machine learning
and Artificial intelligence." If the co-reference resolution is turned
on, both “Michaels" are linked to the same entity (the basketball
player), but if this parameter is turned off, MAG is able to find both
correctly.

For the sake of clarity, there is no machine learning in MAG,
thus there is no cross-validation set or held-out validation while
choosing the parameters.

4.2.2 Multilingual Results. Here, we show the easy portability
and high quality of MAG for many different languages. Next to
German, Italian, Spanish, French and Dutch, we chose Japanese to
show the promising potential of MAG across different language
systems. MAG’s preprocessing NLP techniques are multilingual,
thus there is no additional implementation for handling the men-
tions with different characters. We used the same set of parameters
as in the English evaluation but excluded the acronyms as they
were only collected for English. Moreover, we performed the Page
Rank algorithm over each KB in each respective language to collect

15We chose the trigram threshold in accordance with the work of Usbeck. et al. [44]

popularity values of their entities. The results displayed in the sec-
ond part of Table 2 show that MAG, using HITS, outperformed all
publicly available state-of-the-art approaches.20 Also, Page Rank
outperformed HITS score on Dutch. The improved performance
of MAG is due to its knowledge-base agnostic algorithms and in-
dexing models. For instance, although the mention “Obama" has a
high popularity in English, it may have less popularity in Italian or
Spanish KBs. Studies about the generation of proper names support
this observation [6, 12].

4.2.3

Fine-Grained Evaluation. In this analysis, we use an ex-
tension of GERBIL done by Waitelonis et al. [47]. This extension
provides a fine-grained evaluation which measures the quality of a
given EL for linking different types of entities. This extension also
considers the assumption of Van Erp et al. [46] that a corpus has a
tendency to focus strongly on prominent or popular entities which
may cause evaluation problems. Hence, the extension evaluates
the capability of a given EL system for finding entities with differ-
ent levels of popularity thus revealing its degree of bias towards
popular entities.

For this evaluation, we used the same set of parameters as for
the English evaluation. The fine-grained analysis shows that MAG
is better at linking persons than other types of entities. This can be
explained by the indexes created by MAG in the offline phase. They
collect last names and rare surfaces for entities. In addition, the
results show that MAG is not biased towards linking only popular
entities as can be seen in Table 3.21

5 SUMMARY
We presented MAG, a KB-agnostic and deterministic approach for
multilingual EL. MAG outperforms the state of the art on all non-
English data sets. In addition, MAG achieves a performance similar
to the state of the art on English data sets. Nevertheless, an average
of 0.63 F-measure places MAG 1st out of 13 annotation systems. As
expected, machine learning-based systems retain their advantages
due to their tuned training on the provided data sets. However, we
are intrigued by our deterministic and knowledge-base independent
performance. In this paper, we analyzed the influence of different
indexing and searching methods as well as the influence of the
data set structure in a fine-grained evaluation. We also provided a
context search without relying on machine learning as previously
done. Moreover, we showed that current ML-based EL approaches
are strongly biased due to their learned model. This behavior can
be seen on multilingual data sets. We also deployed and analyzed
the influence of acronyms and last names. To the best of our knowl-
edge, no work has investigated this influence on EL and provided a
fine-grained evaluation before. In the future, we intend to further
investigate disambiguation algorithms and MAG’s performance
in biomedical and earth science domains using the same data set
from Wang et. al [48]. We also aim to evaluate MAG on different
languages such as Arabic using other data sets from [43] and export
the experiment configurations based on the MEX Vocabulary[10]
for reproducibility purposes.
