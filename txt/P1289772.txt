Abstract

Conventional few-shot object segmentation methods learn object segmentation
from a few labelled support images with strongly labelled segmentation masks.
Recent work has shown to perform on par with weaker levels of supervision in terms
of scribbles and bounding boxes. However, there has been limited attention given
to the problem of few-shot object segmentation with image-level supervision. We
propose a novel multi-modal interaction module for few-shot object segmentation
that utilizes a co-attention mechanism using both visual and word embeddings.
It enables our model to achieve 5.1% improvement over previously proposed
image-level few-shot object segmentation. Our method compares relatively close
to the state of the art methods that use strong supervision, while ours use the
least possible supervision. We further propose a novel setup for few-shot weakly
supervised video object segmentation(VOS) that relies on image-level labels for the
ﬁrst frame. The proposed setup uses weak annotation unlike semi-supervised VOS
setting that utilizes strongly labelled segmentation masks. The setup evaluates the
effectiveness of generalizing to novel classes in the VOS setting. The setup splits
the VOS data into multiple folds with different categories per fold. It provides a
potential setup to evaluate how few-shot object segmentation methods can beneﬁt
from additional object poses, or object interactions that is not available in static
frames as in PASCAL-5i benchmark.

Introduction

The few-shot learning literature has mainly focused on the classiﬁcation task such as Koch et al.
(2015)Vinyals et al. (2016)Snell et al. (2017)Qi et al. (2017)Finn et al. (2017)Ravi & Larochelle
(2016)Sung et al. (2018)Qiao et al. (2018). Recently, solutions for few-shot object segmentation
which learns pixel-wise classiﬁcation based on few labelled samples have emerged Shaban et al.
(2017)Rakelly et al. (2018)Dong & Xing (2018)Wang et al. (2019)Zhang et al. (2019a)Zhang et al.
(2019b)Siam et al. (2019). Previous literature in few-shot object segmentation relied on manually
labelled segmentation masks. A few recent works Rakelly et al. (2018)Zhang et al. (2019b)Wang
et al. (2019) started to conduct experiments using weak annotations in terms of scribbles, bounding
boxes. However, limited research was conducted on using image-level supervision for few-shot object
segmentation with one sole recent work Raza et al. (2019).

∗equally contributing

Preprint. Under review.

In order to improve image-level few-shot object segmentation we propose a multi-modal interaction
module that leverages the interaction between support and query visual features and word embeddings.
The use of neural word embeddings pretrained on GoogleNews Mikolov et al. (2013) and visual
embeddings from pretrained networks on ImageNet Deng et al. (2009) allows to build such a model.
We propose a novel approach that uses Stacked Co-Attention to leverage the interaction among
visual and word embeddings. We mainly inspire from Lu et al. (2019) which proposed a co-attention
siamese network for unsupervised video object segmentation. However, our setup mainly focuses
on the few-shot object segmentation aspect to assess its ability to generalize to novel classes. This
aspect motivates why we meta-learned a multi-modal interaction module that leverages the interaction
between support and query with image-level supervision.

Concurrent to few-shot object segmentation, video object segmentation(VOS) has been extensively
researched Pont-Tuset et al. (2017)Perazzi et al. (2016)Lu et al. (2019)Tokmakov et al. (2016)Jain
et al. (2017)Luiten et al. (2018). Two main categories for video object segmentation are studied which
are semi-supervised VOS and unsupervised VOS. The semi-supervised VOS also named as few-shot
requires an initial strongly labelled segmentation mask to be provided. In a recent work Khoreva
et al. (2018) video object segmentation using language expression has been studied. However, their
work does not focus on the aspect of segmenting novel categories which we try to address since it
can be of potential beneﬁt to the few-shot learning community. The additional temporal information
in VOS can provide extra unlabelled data about the object poses or its interactions with other objects
to the few-shot object segmentation method. It has the potential to be closer to human-like learning
rather than learning from a single frame. To the best of our knowledge we are the ﬁrst to propose a
novel setup for video object segmentation that focuses on the ability to generalize to novel classes by
splitting the categories to different folds which would better assess the generalization ability. The
setup as well only requires image-level labels for the ﬁrst frame to segment the corresponding objects
unlike conventional semi-supervised VOS. Although Youtube-VOS Xu et al. (2018) provided a way
to evaluate on certain unseen categories but it does not utilize any of the category label information in
the segmentation model. However, in order to ensure the evaluation for the few-shot method is not
biased to a certain category, it is best to split into multiple folds and evaluate on different ones. To
this end we use Youtube-VOS dataset Xu et al. (2018) which is a large-scale VOS dataset with 65
different object categories, the originally provided training data is further split into 5 different folds
with 13 novel classes per fold. The novel setup opens the door towards studying how few-shot object
segmentation can beneﬁt from temporal information for the different object poses or its interactions.
The main contributions in this paper are summarized as follows:

• A novel formulation for learning image-level labelled few-shot segmentation based on
a multi-modal interaction module is presented. It utilizes neural word embeddings and
attention mechanisms that relates the support and query images. It enables attention to the
most relevant spatial locations in the query feature maps.

• We propose a novel setup called few-shot weakly supervised video object segmentation that

can be of potential beneﬁt to few-shot object segmentation.

2 Method

2.1 Stacked Co-Attention

A simple conditioning on the support set image would be insufﬁcient where neither sparse nor dense
annotations is provided. In order to leverage the interaction between the support set images and query
set image a conditioned support-to-query attention module is used to learn the correlation between
them. Initially a base network is used to extract features from support set image Is and query image
Iq which we denote as Vs ∈ RW ×H×C and Vq ∈ RW ×H×C. Where H and W denote the feature
maps height and width respectively, while C denote the feature channels.

It is important to initially capture the class label semantic representation through using semantic
word embeddings Mikolov et al. (2013) before performing the co-attention. The main reason is that
both the support set and query set can contain multiple common objects from different classes, so
depending solely on the support-to-query attention will fail in this case. A projection layer is used
on the semantic word embeddings to construct z ∈ Rd where d is 256. It is then spatially tiled and
concatenated with the visual features resulting in ˜Vs and ˜Vq. An afﬁnity matrix S is then computed to

capture the similarity between them using equation 1.

S = ˜Vs

Wco ˜Vq

T

(1)

(2a)

The feature maps are ﬂattened into matrix representations where ˜Vq ∈ RC×W H and ˜Vs ∈ RC×W H ,
while Wco ∈ RC×C learns the correlation between feature channels. We use a vanilla co-attention
similar to Lu et al. (2019) where Wco is learned using a fully connected layer. The resulting afﬁnity
matrix S ∈ RW H×W H relates each column from ˜Vq and ˜Vs. A softmax operation is performed on
the S row-wise and column-wise depending on what relation direction we are interested in following
equations 2a and 2b.

Sc = softmax(S)

Sr = softmax(ST )
(2b)
Sc
∗,j has the relevance of the jth spatial location in Vq with all spatial locations of Vs, where
j = 1, ..., W H. The normalized afﬁnity matrix can be used to compute Uq using equation 3 and Us
similarly. Uq and Us act as the attention summaries.

Uq = ˜VsSc
(3)
The attention summaries are further gated using a gating function fg with learnable weights Wg and
bias bg following equations 4a and 4b. The gating function ensures the output to be in the interval [0,
1] in order to mask the attention summaries using a sigmoid activation function σ. The ◦ operator
denotes the hadamard product or element-wise multiplication.

fg(Uq) = σ(WgUq + bg) ∈ [0, 1]

(4a)

Uq = fg(Uq) ◦ Uq
(4b)
The gated attention summaries Uq are concatenated with the original visual features Vq and reshaped
back to construct the ﬁnal output from the attention module. Figure 1 demonstrates our proposed
method. We utilize a ResNet-50 He et al. (2016) encoder pre-trained on ImageNet Deng et al. (2009)
to extract visual features. The segmentation decoder is comprised of an iterative optimization module
(IOM) Zhang et al. (2019b) and an atrous spatial pyramid pooling (ASPP) Chen et al. (2017a)Chen
et al. (2017b). In order to improve our model we use two stacked co-attention modules. It allows
the model to learn a better representation by letting the support set guide the attention on the query
image and the reverse with respect to the support set through multiple iterations.

2.2 Few-Shot Weakly Supervised Video Object Segmentation

We propose a novel setup for few-shot video object segmentation where we utilize image-level labelled
ﬁrst frame to learn object segmentation in the sequence rather than using manual segmentation masks.
More importantly the setup is devised in a way to split the categories to multiple folds to assess
the generalization ability to novel classes. We utilize Youtube-VOS dataset training data which has
65 categories, and we split into 5 folds. Each fold has 13 classes that are used as novel classes,
while the rest are used in the meta-training phase. A randomly sampled category Ys and sequence
V = {I1, I2, ..., IN } is used to construct support set Sp = {(I1, Ys)} and query images Ii.

3 Experimental Results

In this section we demonstrate results from experiments conducted on the PASCAL-5i dataset Shaban
et al. (2017) which is the most widely used dataset for evaluating few-shot segmentation. We also
conduct experiments on our novel few-shot weakly supervised video object segmentation.

3.1 Experimental Setup

We report two evaluation metrics, the mean-IoU computes the intersection over union for all 5 classes
within the fold and averages them neglecting the background Shaban et al. (2017). Whereas the
binary-IoU metric proposed in Rakelly et al. (2018)Dong & Xing (2018) computes the mean of
foreground and background IoU in a class agnostic manner. Both metrics are reported as an average
of 5 different runs to ensure a stable result following Wang et al. (2019). We have also noticed some
deviation in the validation schemes used in previous works. Zhang et al. (2019b) follows a procedure
where the validation is performed on the Ltest classes to save the best model whereas Wang et al.
(2019) does not perform validation and rather trains for a ﬁxed number of iterations. We choose the
approach followed in Wang et al. (2019) since we consider that the Ltest classes are not available
during the initial meta-training phase.

3.2 Few-shot Weakly Supervised Object Segmentation

We compare the result of our proposed method with stacked co-attention against the other state of the
art methods for 1-way 1-shot segmentation on pascal-5i in Table 1 using mean-IoU and binary-IoU
metrics. We report the results for both the two validation schemes where V1 is following Zhang
et al. (2019b) and V2 is following Wang et al. (2019) validation scheme. Without the utilization of
segmentation mask or even sparse annotations, our method with the least supervision of image level
labels performs relatively on-par 53.5% compared to the current state of the art methods 56% showing
the efﬁcacy of our proposed algorithm. It outperforms the previous one-shot weakly supervised
segmentation Raza et al. (2019) with 5.1%. Our proposed model outperforms the baseline method
which utilizes a co-attention module without using word embeddings. Figure 2 shows the qualitative
results for our proposed approach.

3.3 Few-shot Weakly Supervised Video Object Segmentation

Table 2 shows results on our proposed novel setup and comparing our method with the baseline of
using co-attention module without utilizing word embeddings similar to Lu et al. (2019). It shows the
potential beneﬁt from utilizing neural word embeddings to guide the attention module.

4 Conclusions

Our proposed method demonstrates great promise toward performing few-shot object segmentation
based on gated co-attention that leverages the interaction between the support set and query image.
Our model utilizes neural word embeddings to guide the attention mechanism which improves the
segmentation accuracy compared to the baseline. We demonstrate promising results on Pascal-5i
where we outperform the previously proposed image-level labelled one-shot segmentation method by
5.1% and perform closer to methods that use strongly labelled masks. Our novel setup provides a
mean to experiment with the effect of capturing different object viewpoints, and appearance changes
in few-shot object segmentation. It closely mimics human learning for novel objects from few
labelled samples by aggregating information from different viewpoints and capturing different object
interactions.
