Abstract

While crowdsourcing has become an important
means to label data, there is great interest in esti-
mating the ground truth from unreliable labels pro-
duced by crowdworkers. The Dawid and Skene
(DS) model is one of the most well-known mod-
els in the study of crowdsourcing. Despite its
practical popularity, theoretical error analysis for
the DS model has been conducted only under re-
strictive assumptions on class priors, confusion
matrices, or the number of labels each worker pro-
vides. In this paper, we derive a minimax error
rate under more practical setting for a broader
class of crowdsourcing models including the DS
model as a special case. We further propose the
worker clustering model, which is more practical
than the DS model under real crowdsourcing set-
tings. The wide applicability of our theoretical
analysis allows us to immediately investigate the
behavior of this proposed model, which can not be
analyzed by existing studies. Experimental results
showed that there is a strong similarity between
the lower bound of the minimax error rate derived
by our theoretical analysis and the empirical error
of the estimated value.

1. Introduction

Crowdsourcing has become an essential tool for large-scale
data collection in machine learning. While crowdsourc-
ing provides a less expensive means of labeling data, the
data annotated by a crowd can be of low quality because
crowd workers are often non-experts and are sometimes
even adversarial. Many crowdsourcing services try to solve

this problem by providing redundancy for labeling, i.e., by
collecting multiple labels from different workers for each
task (Ipeirotis et al., 2010; Welinder et al., 2010; Snow
et al., 2008). This strategy raises the question: how can the
ground truths be estimated from noisy and redundant labels?
Estimating the ground truth is difﬁcult in the laissez-faire
crowdsourcing setting in which a large number of workers
in the world can freely label as many tasks as they want. In
this setting, a small number of workers annotate data a large
number of times, while most workers perform annotation
only a few times. That is, the number of tasks to be labeled
per worker typically follows Zipf’s law. In this paper, we
focus on this setting because it is more realistic than the non-
laissez-faire crowdsourcing setting, in which the number of
tasks to be labeled per worker is almost constant across all
workers and which is assumed in the experiments of many
previous works (Welinder et al., 2010; Snow et al., 2008).

In the context of estimating the ground truth of each task
from noisy and redundant labels, Dawid & Skene (1979)
conducted pioneering research. It is assumed in the Dawid
and Skene (DS) model that each worker has his or her own
confusion matrix. The ground truth of each task and the
confusion matrix of each worker are jointly estimated by
the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm (Dempster
et al., 1977).

Although the DS model has had empirical success (Welinder
et al., 2010; Snow et al., 2008), there are two major prob-
lems. First, there are few theoretical error analyses on the
performance conducted for the DS model, and the existing
theoretical analyses are only valid under strong assumptions.
For example, Gao et al. (2016) assumed that the class prior
is uniform and Zhang et al. (2014) assumed that the entries
of the confusion matrices are strictly positive. Second, the
experimental validity of the existing methods is conﬁrmed
only when the number of tasks to be labeled per worker
is almost constant on both synthetic and real-world data
(Welinder et al., 2010; Snow et al., 2008).

To alleviate the ﬁrst problem, we provide a novel theoretical
error analysis under milder assumptions based on Fano’s
method, which is a useful minimax lower-bounding tech-
nique (Yu, 1997). Our theoretical analysis is applicable to
all models that use the ground truth of each task and the

Analysis of Minimax Error Rate for Crowdsourcing and Its Application to Worker Clustering Model

confusion matrix of each worker, including the DS model
and its extensions, thanks to the fact that our assumptions
are much weaker than those required in previous work.

To alleviate the second problem, we extend the DS model
to be able to handle worker clusters. Intuitively, by cluster-
ing workers, even when the number of tasks to be labeled
per worker is small, the number of tasks to be labeled per
worker cluster can be increased and thus estimation can be
stabilized. Note that our widely applicable theoretical anal-
ysis explained above allows us to investigate the behavior
of the proposed clustering model, while the existing theoret-
ical analysis methods cannot be used due to their restrictive
assumptions. We experimentally show the usefulness of our
worker clustering (WC) model for reducing the inﬂuence of
variations in the number of tasks to be labeled per worker.
We also numerically conﬁrm the validity of our theoretical
error analysis.

2. Related Work

A large number of studies on the quality assurance of data
collected by crowdsourcing have been conducted (Karger
et al., 2011; Bachrach et al., 2012; Zhou et al., 2012; Chen
et al., 2013; Karger et al., 2013; Parisi et al., 2014; Venanzi
et al., 2014; Karger et al., 2014; Tian & Zhu, 2015). One
of the most practical and pioneering studies in this ﬁeld is
the Dawid and Skene (DS) model (Dawid & Skene, 1979).
The DS model is based on an estimation paradigm that uses
the ground truths of all tasks and the confusion matrices of
all workers; their inference algorithm is based on the EM
algorithm (Dempster et al., 1977). Application research
using their method has been actively carried out (Hui &
Walter, 1980; Smyth et al., 1995; Albert & Dodd, 2004).
As many experiments on synthetic and real-world data have
demonstrated, the DS model is practical for estimating the
ground truth of each task from noisy and redundant labels.

There is also many studies that uses the EM algorithm
(Whitehill et al., 2009; Welinder et al., 2010; Raykar et al.,
2010; Welinder & Perona, 2010; Liu et al., 2012; Liu &
Wang, 2012; Zhang et al., 2014). Liu & Wang (2012) as-
sume priors over the class prior of the ground truths of tasks
and the confusion matrices of workers. Zhang et al. (2014)
devised an effective way to initialize the EM algorithm.
Speciﬁcally, the initial values of the confusion matrices of
all workers were estimated using the method of moments.
Karger et al. (2011) proposed an iterative algorithm for bi-
nary labeling problems which is not based on the DS model,
and gave a theoretical analysis under strong assumptions.

The idea of clustering worker was already proposed by Ve-
nanzi et al. (2015) and Moreno et al. (2015). The problem
setting of Venanzi et al. (2015) supposed that the inputs of
the model are not labels but real-valued vectors, which is

different from our problem setting. Moreno et al. (2015)
solved the same problem as ours, but assumed a complex
generation process for confusion matrices and labels given
by workers. To give the worker clustering structure, their
model becomes complex, and difﬁcult to analyze theoreti-
cally.

As a number of algorithms have been proposed, statisti-
cal understanding of crowdsourcing has been actively re-
searched, such as (Ghosh et al., 2011; Dalvi et al., 2013;
Karger et al., 2014; Zhang et al., 2014; Gao et al., 2016;
Bonald & Combes, 2017). These studies are divided into
two types. One is a theoretical analysis of the estimation
paradigm that uses the ground truths and confusion matrices
(Zhang et al., 2014; Gao et al., 2016). The other is a theo-
retical analysis of their own models and algorithms (Ghosh
et al., 2011; Dalvi et al., 2013; Karger et al., 2014; Bonald
& Combes, 2017). Our theoretical analysis is of the former
category.

Zhang et al. (2014) initialized the confusion matrices of all
workers using the method of moments and showed conver-
gence of the EM algorithm initialized with their method.
However, they assumed that the minimum value of the en-
tries of the confusion matrices is greater than a positive
constant. Gao et al. (2016) derived the minimax optimal
convergence rate for the DS model, but they assumed that
the class prior is uniform.

Bonald & Combes (2017) gave a probabilistic concentration
inequality for the estimation error between the ground truth
and estimated truth without using the confusion matrices of
workers. While their result cannot be calculated empirically,
our theoretical result can be calculated using the estimated
confusion matrices and the class prior. We describe the
usefulness of calculating the bound in Section 6.3 Because
of our weaker assumptions, our theoretical analysis is appli-
cable to all methods that use the estimation paradigm based
on the ground truths of all tasks and confusion matrices of
all workers.

3. Dawid and Skene Model

In this section, we formulate the problem of estimating the
ground truths of tasks based on noisy and redundant labels
provided by workers and their confusion matrices. The
model formulated in this section is the basis of all models
to be theoretically analyzed in the next section.

Suppose we have n tasks labeled by m workers on K possible
labels. Let Xi, j be the label of the i-th task given by the j-th
worker. Denote by Xi, j = k that the j-th worker labels k ∈
{1, 2, . . . , K} to the i-th task. Denote by Xi, j = 0 that the j-th
worker does not label the i-th task. We use Gi ∈ {1, 2, . . . , K}
to denote the ground truth of the i-th task. Here, SK×K is the

The ability of the j-th worker is measured by a confusion
matrix π j ∈ SK×K with its (k, k(cid:48))-element π j
k,k(cid:48) being the
probability that the j-th worker labels k(cid:48) when the true label
is k. For simplicity, we deﬁne

X = {Xi, j}n,m

i=1, j=1, G = {Gi}n

i=1, π = {π j}m

j=1.

We suppose that when Gi = k is the ground truth of the
i-th task, the label given by the j-th worker is sampled
from a multinomial distribution parametrized by the k-th
row of the confusion matrix of the j-th worker, namely,
π j
k. We assume that the ground truth of each task, Gi, is
sampled from a multinomial distribution parametrized by
ρ = (ρ1, ρ2, . . . , ρK), where ρk ≥ 0 for any k ∈ {1, . . . , K}
and (cid:80)K
k=1 ρk = 1. We call ρ the class prior of all tasks.
We have observed variables X, latent variables G, and pa-
rameters {π, ρ}. The graphical model is plotted in Figure
1-(a).

Then, the joint distribution of this model is expressed as
follows.

The aim is to predict the ground truths of all tasks, G, from
observed labels X. Dawid & Skene (1979) used the EM
algorithm to infer the ground truths. However, when we
conduct theoretical analysis in the next section, we take
an approach that does not depend on a speciﬁc inference
algorithm.

We give a lower bound on the minimax error for a class of
models that use the ground truths of tasks and confusion ma-
trices of workers. Let us deﬁne some concepts and formulas
for analysis.

We focus on the model described in Section 3. Note that the
model may optionally contain additional structures, such as
a prior for the class prior (Liu & Wang, 2012). Moreover,
we can use any inference algorithm to estimate the ground
truths and class prior of tasks and the confusion matrices
of workers. Let ˆG be estimated truths of all tasks; let ˆGi
be an estimate of the ground truth of the i-th task. The set
of {1, . . . , K} is denoted by [K]. A loss is measured by the
error rate given by

L ( ˆG, G) = 1

δ( ˆGi (cid:44) Gi),

where δ(·) is the indicator function. Let P be the joint proba-
bility distribution of the data {Xi, j} given π, ρ and G. Let E
be the associated expectation operator. Denote by H(ρ) the
entropy of the ground truth of each task with respect to the
class prior:

We assume the following.
Assumption 1. Given ρ and π, the labels of tasks given
by workers are in accordance with the models that use the
ground truths of tasks and confusion matrices of workers
such as the DS model.

We bound the minimax error rate as follows.

The details of the proof are given in Appendix A. The proof
of this theorem is based on Fano’s method by Yu (1997),
which is a well-known minimax lower bounding technique.

Assumption 1 is weaker than that of many previous works
such as Gao et al. (2016) and Zhang et al. (2014). As we
mentioned in the introduction, their approaches make more
restrictive assumptions to conduct theoretical analysis. For
example, Gao et al. (2016) assumed that class prior ρ is
uniform, that is, ρk = 1
K for any k ∈ {1, . . . , K}. Zhang
et al. (2014) assumed that all entries π j
g,k of the confusion
matrix is strictly positive. In contrast, thanks to the weak
assumptions, our lower bound is applicable to the DS mode
and other models that use the ground truths of tasks and
confusion matrices of workers such as Zhang et al. (2014)
and Liu & Wang (2012).

Our lower bound can be used to measure the performance
of each model. Speciﬁcally, the performance of each model
can be measured by the value of R(ρ, π), which is the main
part of the lower bound of the minimax error rate. We con-
ducted numerical experiments to measure the performance
of each model, the results of which are given in the experi-
ment section.

In this paper, we provided the lower bound of the minimax
error rate but did not give an upper bound. The theoretical
analysis of the previous work such as Gao et al. (2016) easily
derived an upper bound under mild assumptions. However,
the derivation depends not only on the model, but also on
an inference algorithm, because inf ˆG supG∈[K]n E[L ( ˆG, G)]
includes the inﬁmum over estimate ˆG. Therefore, it is not
appropriate to use such an upper bound when analyzing the
behavior of the model itself.

5. Worker Clustering Model

can label as many tasks as they want. The main idea behind
our model is simple: divide all workers into several disjoint
clusters. Intuitively, by clustering workers, even if the num-
ber of labels provided by each worker is small, the number
of labels per worker cluster can be increased to stabilize
inference.

The deﬁnition of the labels given by workers X, the ground
truths of all tasks G, the class prior ρ, and the confusion
matrices of all workers π are the same as that of the DS
model. The proposed model can actually be regarded as
an extension of the DS model and the HybridConfusion
model (Liu & Wang, 2012). The biggest difference from
the previous models is that the proposed model limits the
possible values of confusion matrices π to a maximum of
L values Λ = {Λ1, Λ2, . . . , ΛL}, where L ≤ m. This means
that we are clustering m workers into a maximum of L
groups. We also suppose that the confusion matrix π j is
determined by a multinomial distribution parametrized by
τ = (τ1, τ2, . . . , τL), that is, π j is equal to Λl with probability
τl. This means that the j-th worker belongs to the l-th cluster
with probability τl. We have observed variables X, latent
variables {G, π} and parameters {Λ, ρ, τ}. The graphical
model is shown in Figure 1-(b).

The joint distribution of this model is expressed as follows.

We propose a model that is more practical than the DS model
in the laissez-faire crowdsourcing setting, where workers

Note that our theoretical analysis given in Section 4 is also
applicable to our proposed WC model. To apply the lower

Analysis of Minimax Error Rate for Crowdsourcing and Its Application to Worker Clustering Model

bound to our model, we use Λ instead of the confusion
matrices as follows. We assume that Λ, class prior ρ, and
a group (cid:96) j which each worker belongs to are known. Un-
der this assumption, ˆφ j,l = 1 when l = (cid:96) j and otherwise
ˆφ j,l = 0. Our lower bound of the minimax error rate is then
established with Λ(cid:96) j instead of a confusion matrix π j.
To estimate latent variables and optimize parameters, we
adopt the strategy of empirical variational inference (Rob-
bins, 1956). The details of the derivations are in Appendix
B in the supplementary material.

The behavior of the WC model when L gradually increases
is as follows. Since L is the maximum number of worker
clusters, even if L = m, not all m workers belong to different
clusters. Some clusters may include many workers, but
others may not include any workers. The actual number
of clusters is adaptively determined for each target dataset.
Therefore, it is not good to increase the value of L, but
there should be an appropriate value of L. The method of
determining the value of L using our theoretical analysis
given in Section 4 is described in Section 6.3.

6. Experiments

We empirically analyzed the proposed method on synthetic
and real-world data. First, we analyzed that the WC model
proposed in Section 5 performs better than the existing
method in the laissez-faire crowdsourcing setting where the
number of labels per worker is in accordance with Zipf’s
law. Second, we investigated that there is a strong similarity
between the lower bound of the minimax error rate derived
by our theoretical analysis in Section 4 and the empirical
error of the estimated value.

We compared our proposed method, the WC model, with the
classical Majority Voting (MV) scheme and the DS model.
The experiments were conducted on four synthetic and three
real-world datasets.

6.1. Synthetic Data

For synthetic data, we generated m = 100 workers and n =
1000 binary annotation tasks. The ground truth of each task
was sampled from the binomial distribution with the class
prior ρ = (0.3, 0.7). For each worker, a confusion matrix
was generated as follows. Workers were divided into two
types: honest and adversarial. Each row of each confusion
matrix was sampled from the Dirichlet distribution. The
concentration parameter of the Dirichlet distribution for the
k-th row was

for adversarial workers. To simulate the labeling process of
a crowd, we consider two settings: The ﬁrst setting is the
“Constant Labeling Number (CLN)” setting , in which we
determine the number N of tasks that all workers commonly
annotate, and then each worker is given N tasks randomly
and label those tasks in acordance with his or her own con-
fusion matrix. The second setting is the “Zipf Labeling
Number (ZLN)” setting, in which, for any j ∈ {1, . . . , m},
we determines the number N j of tasks that the j-th worker
annotates in accordance with Zipf’s law, and then the j-th
worker is randomly given N j tasks and labels those tasks
according to his or her own confusion matrix. The CLN
setting was assumed in the experiments of many existing
studies (e.g. Welinder et al., 2010; Snow et al., 2008). The
ZLN setting is suitable for the laissez-faire crowdsourcing
setting.

The input of each model was a set of triplets (task, worker,
and label) generated by this procedure. The outputs of the
WC and DS models were estimated values of the ground
truths and class prior of all tasks and the confusion matrices
of all workers. In order to measure how robust each method
is to the proportion of adversaries, we showed the change in
accuracy as a function of the proportion of adversaries (see
Figure 2). We changed the proportion of adversaries from 0
to 50%.

The accuracy of MV monotonically decreases as the pro-
portion of adversaries increases in all cases. In the CLN
setting, when the number of times each worker labels is
sufﬁciently large (N = 100), the accuracies of DS and WC
remain high even if the proportion of adversaries is high
(nearly 0.5) (see Figure 2-(c)). In contrast, when the number
of times each worker labels is small (N = 2, 10), the accu-
racy of DS is low (almost the chance level), but that of WC
remains high (see Figure 2-(a), (b)). Intuitively, the reason
for this phenomenon is that WC effectively increased the
number of labeled tasks per cluster by clustering workers
and thus the estimation became more reliable. In particular,
this phenomenon is noticeable when the number of tasks to
be labeled per worker follows Zipf’s law, i.e., in the ZLN
setting (see Figure 2-(d)). Even if the average or the maxi-
mum value of the number of tasks to be labeled per worker
is large, when most workers only label a small number, the
accuracy of DS is not high. When the number of times most
workers label is small, the proposed method WC is more
effective than MV and DS.

6.2. Real-World Data

In the real-world data experiments, we compared crowd-
sourcing algorithms on three datasets: two binary tasks and
one multi-class task. The two binary tasks were labeling
bird species (Welinder et al., 2010) (the Bird dataset) and
recognizing textual entailment (Snow et al., 2008) (the RTE

dataset). The multi-class task was labeling the breed of dogs
(Zhou et al., 2012) (the Dog dataset). The statistics for the
datasets were summarized in Table 2.

We calculated the error rate of the WC model by changing
the value of parameter L. In Table 3, we reported the values
for L = 1, 2, 10 and the value of the error rate when R(ρ, π)
attains its minimum. Table 3 also shows the error rate
calculated by MV and DS as baselines. It can be seen that
the error rate decreases as the value of L increases in the
WC model. For the RTE dataset, the WC model is superior
to both MV and DS when L ≥ 2. For the Bird dataset, the
WC model outperforms MV for all L and DS when L ≥ 10.
For the Dog dataset, the WC model does not outperform DS
even when L = 10; as the value of L is increased, the WC
model outperforms DS when R(ρ, π) is minimum.

As expected, the performance of the WC model depends
heavily on the choice of L. However, the experimental
results show that larger L always yields better performance.
We will investigate this issue more systematically in Section
6.3.

6.3. Similarity between Lower Bound of Minimax

Error Rate and Empirical Error

We experimentally investigated the similarity between the
lower bound of the minimax error rate and the empirical
error of the ground truths of tasks estimated by the WC
model.

It is important to note that the lower bound of the mini-
max error rate derived by our theoretical analysis can be
approximately calculated from the class prior and confusion
matrices estimated by each method, but the empirical error
of the ground truths of tasks estimated by each method can
not be calculated without the ground truths of those tasks. In
practice, we want to adopt a model that makes the empirical
error as small as possible, but its calculation is impossible

because of the necessity of the ground truths of tasks. If
there is some similarity between the empirical error and
lower bound of the minimax error rate, we can estimate the
behavior of each model by the theoretical lower bound even
in a more realistic situation in which we do not know the
ground truths of tasks.

Here we experimentally investigate the behavior of R(ρ, π)
and L ( ˆG, G) against the change in the value of the max-
imum number of worker clusters, L for the WC model.
R(ρ, π) is the main part of the lower bound of the minimax
error rate derived by our theoretical analysis introduced
in Section 4, while L ( ˆG, G) is the empirical error of the
estimated truths of tasks by the WC model.

The experiment was conducted on three synthetic datasets
and three real-world datasets. For each dataset, we plotted
in Figure 3 the change in R(ρ, π) and L ( ˆG, G) as a function
of the parameter L. The value of L was changed from 1 to m.
In Figure 3, the results of L ( ˆG, G) and R(ρ, π) are shown
in the left and right columns, respectively.

For all cases, we see that increasing the value of L tends to
decrease the values of R(ρ, π) and L ( ˆG, G) similarly. This
means that the behavior of L ( ˆG, G) can be well predicted
by R(ρ, π). Looking at the change in L ( ˆG, G), to achieve
better performance, we can see that it is sufﬁcient to set the
value of L to be large to some extent. This behavior can
be well captured by looking at the change in R(ρ, π) which
can be computed in practice. Thus, our theoretical lower
bound may be useful to investigate the behavior of different
models.

7. Conclusions

In this paper, we gave a novel theoretical error analysis by
using Fano’s method for any models based on the ground
truths of tasks and the confusion matrices of workers. We
have considered a realistic laissez-faire crowdsourcing set-
ting and proposed clustering workers to reduce the effect
of the bias in the number of tasks to be labeled per worker.
Our theoretical analysis is applicable to all models that use
the ground truths of tasks and the confusion matrices of
workers, including Dawid & Skene (1979) and its variations,
thanks to the weak assumptions required in our analysis.
Through experiments on synthetic and real-world data, we
have found that there is a strong similarity between the lower
bound of the minimax error rate derived by our theoretical
analysis and the empirical error of the estimated value. Thus,
our theoretical lower bound, which can be approximately
calculated from an established class prior and estimated
confusion matrices, can be useful to investigate the behavior
of different models in practice.

data processing inequality, i.e.,

H(G| ˆG) = H(G) − I(G; ˆG)
≥ H(G) − I(G; X).

A. Proof of Theorem 1

Fano’s method (Yu, 1997) uses Fano’s inequality (Fano,
1949) to give a lower bound for the minimax error rate.
In the method, the uniformity of a class prior is assumed.
However, it is not realistic for crowdsourcing. Therefore, we
do not use Fano’s method directly but improve the method
to be suitable for crowdsourcing. We use the following
inequality between the error probability and a conditional
entropy.

Lemma 2 (Fano’s inequality Fano (1949)).
For any Markov chain V → X → ˆV, we have

where h(p) = −p log p − (1 − p) log(1 − p), V is the set
of possible value of V, and H(V| ˆV) is the entropy of V
conditioned on ˆV.

Since the elements of G = (G1, . . . , Gn) are independent and
identically distributed, we have

H(G| ˆG) ≥ nH(ρ) − I(G; X)

(3)

Then the mutual information of G and X is evaluated as
follows.

I(G; X)
