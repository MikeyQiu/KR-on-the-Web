Abstract

The 2.0 release of the Universal Depen-
dency treebanks demonstrates the effec-
tiveness of the UD scheme to cope with
very diverse languages. The next step
would be to get more of syntactic anal-
ysis, and the “enhanced dependencies”
sketched in the UD 2.0 guidelines is a
promising attempt in that direction.
In
this work we propose to go further and
enrich the enhanced dependency scheme
along two axis: extending the cases of re-
covered arguments of non-ﬁnite verbs, and
neutralizing syntactic alternations. Do-
ing so leads to both richer and more uni-
form structures, while remaining at the
syntactic level, and thus rather neutral
with respect to the type of semantic rep-
resentation that can be further obtained.
We implemented this proposal in two UD
treebanks of French, using deterministic
graph-rewriting rules. Evaluation on a 200
sentence gold standard shows that deep
syntactic graphs can be obtained from sur-
face syntax annotations with a high accu-
racy. Among all arguments of verbs in
the gold standard, 13.91% are impacted
by syntactic alternation normalization, and
18.93% are additional deep edges.

1 Introduction

initiative (UD,
The Universal Dependencies
(Nivre et al., 2016)) is one of the major achieve-
ments of the last few years in the NLP ﬁeld. Orig-
inating from the need of a better interopability
in cross-language settings for downstream tasks
(Petrov et al., 2011; McDonald et al., 2013), it
has gathered dozens of international teams who

released annotated versions of their treebanks, fol-
lowing the UD annotation scheme.

Although UD has raised criticisms, both on the
suitability of the scheme to meet linguistic typol-
ogy (Croft et al., 2017) and on the current imple-
mentation of the UD treebanks (Gerdes and Ka-
hane, 2016), the existence of many treebanks with
same syntactic scheme does however ease cross-
language linguistic analysis and enables parsers
to generalize across languages at training time, as
demonstrated by Ammar et al. (2016).

The UD scheme favors dependencies between
content words, in order to maximize parallelism
between languages. Although this results in de-
pendencies that are more semantic-oriented, the
UD scheme lies at the surface syntax level and thus
necessarily lacks abstraction over syntactic varia-
tion and does not ﬁt all downstream applications’
needs (Schuster and Manning, 2016).

This is partly why de Marneffe and Manning
(2008) proposed a decade ago, in the Stanford De-
pendencies framework, several schemes with var-
ious semantic-oriented modiﬁcations of syntactic

structures.
representation layer1 has
recently started to be
extended and implemented as “Enhanced Depen-
dencies” in the UD scheme family (Schuster and
Manning, 2016). Current UD speciﬁcations leave
open the possibility to include phenomena (cf.
section 2) that make explicit additional predicate-
argument dependencies. In practice, most current
UD treebanks contain either very few or no en-
hanced dependencies at all2.

the collapsed
scheme is the furthest away from the plain dependency tree.

Stanford parser (https://nlp.stanford.edu/software/stanford-

Pisa, Italy, September 18-20 2017

Of course, as noted by Kuhlmann and Oepen
(2016), competing proposals for deep syntactic
graphs already exist and are implemented through
in some few cases, multilingual
diverse and,
graphbanks.
More clearly semantic schemes
seem to depend on the needs of the downstream
application or impose their own constraints on the
syntactic layer it is either built upon or plugged in.
See for example the differences between abstract
meaning representations (Knight et al., 2014), de-
signed with Machine Translation in sight, and the
UDEPLAMBDA’s logical structures, very recently
proposed by Reddy et al. (2017) and evaluated on
a question-answering over a knowledge base task.
In this paper, we build on the work of (Can-
dito et al., 2014; Perrier et al., 2014) to propose
an extension to the current enhanced dependency
framework of Schuster and Manning (2016). First,
we extend the types of argumental dependencies
made explicit (taking into account participles, con-
trol nouns and adjectives, non-ﬁnite verbs and
more cases of inﬁnitive verbs). Second, we neu-
tralize syntactic alternations,
in order to make
linking patterns more regular for a given verb
form. We believe that making explicit and normal-
ize the predicate-argument structures, still remain-
ing at the syntactic level, can make downstream
semantic analysis more straightforward (as shown
for instance in (Michalon et al., 2016)), while re-
maining neutral with respect to what exact seman-
tic representation can be further derived.

The originality of our approach is to neutral-
ize syntactic alternations using canonical gram-
matical functions, which render linking patterns of
verbs more regular but are still syntactic in nature,
unlike what can be found for example in the tecto-
grammatical layer of the Prague Dependency bank
(Hajic et al., 2006).

This proposal is currently being implemented
for French, and tested on two UD treebanks (Can-
dito et al., 2014; Nivre et al., 2016) by the means
of a rule-based deterministic process. We evalu-
ated the deep syntactic graphs automatically con-
verted from gold UD trees and obtained a 94%
F-measure on a two-hundred sentences gold stan-
dard, similar to what reported Candito et al. (2014)
on a similar task. Both treebanks and building
rules are made available3 to foster further work
in other languages and to gather the opinion and
criticisms of the community regarding the level of

abstraction we should reach when it comes to deep
syntax representation.
In the following, we ﬁrst brieﬂy introduce the cur-
rent Enhanced UD scheme, we detail extensions
concerning arguments of non-ﬁnite verbs in sec-
tion 3 and syntactic alternations for French in sec-
tion 4. We present and evaluate a system to obtain
enhanced graphs for French in section 5. We then
discuss related work and conclude.

2 Enhanced UD representation

The current version of universal dependencies
guidelines (v2.0) includes an enhanced dependen-
cies section4, leaving the possibility for UD tree-
banks to include all or only some of the following
phenomena:

1. Additional subject relations for control and

raising constructions
2. Propagation of conjuncts
3. Antecedent of relative pronouns in noun-

modifying relative clauses

4. Modiﬁer labels that contain the preposition or

other case-marking information
5. Null nodes for elided predicates

In our implementation for French, we cope with
the two ﬁrst phenomena. Phenomena 3 and 4
are quite systematic and may be handled auto-
matically and phenomenon 5 requires manual an-
notation. Note that while enhanced dependen-
cies (as were Stanford dependencies) are moti-
vated by downstream semantically-oriented appli-
cations, they remain syntactic in nature in their
current stage. This results in keeping syntac-
tic dependents that are not semantic arguments
of their syntactic head, in classic cases of syn-
tax/semantics mismatch. So for instance, sub-
jects of raising verbs are not removed from the
enhanced UD graph, although they are not a se-
mantic argument of the raising verb, as shown in
Fig. 1.

Figure 1: Raising verb

Following the work of Candito et al. (2014) and
Perrier et al. (2014), we propose two extensions,

4http://universaldependencies.org/u/overview/

3http://github.com/bguil/Depling2017

enhanced-syntax.html

that we detail in the next two sections:
the ﬁrst
one is to extend the cases for which arguments
are added to inﬁnitive verbs and more generally
to non-ﬁnite verbs. The second one concerns the
neutralisation of syntactic alternations.

3 Recovering arguments of non-ﬁnite

verbs

The aim of enhancing UD dependencies is to fa-
cilitate the computation of predicate-argument re-
lations at the semantic level. In this perspective,
we propose to go beyond the explicitation of con-
trol and raising verbs subjects. We detail below
other cases of obligatory syntactic control, and
cases which are not as systematic but which prove
feasible with rather high accuracy using heuristics.

3.1 Cases fully determined by syntax

“Control nouns”
In French, some nouns take a
nominal and an inﬁnitive argument, that can be
both realized within the NP or as a predicative
complement (Fig. 2).
In both cases, the subject
of the inﬁnitive is the nominal argument.

Figure 2: Paul’s intention is to ﬁnish early

The preposition introducing the inﬁnitival
clause is determined by the control noun. It is gen-
erally de, more rarely `a, as in example (1).

(1)

votre
your

capacit´e
capacity

`a
to

conduire
drive

un
a

v´ehicule
vehicle

“Control adjectives” Control adjectives take an
inﬁnitive complement, whose understood subject
is the noun to which the adjective applies, as
shown in Fig. 3.

Figure 3: Control adjective

Tough movement Tough movement describes
constructions in which an adjective has an inﬁni-
tive as complement and the noun to which the ad-
jective applies is the direct object of the inﬁnitive.

The adjective can be attributive or used as a pred-
icative adjective (Fig. 4)5. These cases are easy to
detect using available lists of tough adjectives6.

Figure 4: Tough movement

Noun-modifying participles When a past or
present participle modiﬁes a noun, the noun is the
understood subject of the participle (Fig. 5).

Figure 5: Noun-modifying participles

Inﬁnitives behaving as noun modiﬁers
In
French, a transitive inﬁnitival clause introduced
with the preposition `a can be the argument of the
noun (as in example (1) in the “control nouns” sec-
tion above, the noun capacit´e (ability) takes two
arguments, the entity having the ability, and an in-
ﬁnitival clause describing what it is able of). But
for any noun, an inﬁnitival clause introduced by
`a can function as an adjunct modifying the noun,
which is understood as either the object (Fig. 6) or
the subject (examples (2) and (3)), depending on
the transitivity of the inﬁnitive.

as the object of the inﬁnitive

5Note in this case, the modiﬁed noun is not a semantic
argument of the adjective, the dependency between difﬁcile
(difﬁcult) and livre (book) should be dropped in a semantic
representation.

6A few “tough nouns” exist too, as in ce livre est un plaisir

`a lire (this book is a pleasure to read).

3.2 Cases requiring semantic or world

knowledge

The cases we just saw correspond to situations of
obligatory control, in which the argument to add to
the non-ﬁnite verb can be deterministically iden-
tiﬁed, given the syntactic construction, and given
the speciﬁc control or raising verb, control noun or
adjective. Other constructions involving an non-
ﬁnite verb are ambiguous with respect to which
non-local argument is understood as the argument
of the verb. In some of these cases though, among
all the potential positions for the non-local argu-
ment to retreive is particularly more frequent, al-
though not strictly obligatory. For the cases de-
tailed in this section, we performed a systematic
study of the occurrences in the Sequoia corpus,
and concluded that simple heuristics could be used
for retreiving the non-local argument of a non-
ﬁnite verb with sufﬁcient accuracy.

case, its subject is most often the subject of the
participle, although exceptions can be built7.

introducing
inﬁnitival clauses, the subject of the inﬁnitive is
most often the subject of the main clause, but
exceptions as illustrated in ex. (4) (the subject of

7We did not ﬁnd any such exception in the Sequoia cor-
pus. The following built up example shows one: Ext´enu´es, on
les a envoy´es dormir. (Exhausted, we them have sent to-sleep)
“Exhausted, they were sent to bed”).

We performed an in-depth study of these cases,
using the deep Sequoia corpus (Candito et al.,
2014), in which all subjects of inﬁnitive verbs
present in the sentence are marked. Breaking
down the 143 inﬁnitive heads of adverbial clauses
according to the voice of the main verb, we obtain
the following results:

• main verb in the active voice: there are 114
cases and among them, the subject of the in-
ﬁnitive is the subject of the main verb in 95
cases; in the 16 remaining cases, the subject
of the inﬁnitive is absent of the sentence;
• main verb in passive voice (or modal intro-
ducing a passive): there are 29 cases; in 11
cases, the subject of the inﬁnitive is the sub-
ject of the main verb; in the 18 remaining
cases, the subject of the inﬁnitive is a virtual
agent of the passive verb, which is not present
in the sentence;

• main verb in medio-passive voice: there are
3 cases, in which the subject of the inﬁnitive
is not present in the sentence.

A heuristic that triggers the sharing for active main
verbs only will obtain a 90% recall and 83% pre-
cision only.

In a similar construction, a present participle in-
troduced with a preposition (en in French and by
in English) plays the role of a modiﬁer for a main
verb. The subject of the participle is generally the
subject of the main verb but again, this does not
hold if the main verb is in passive voice (or is a
modal introducing a passive, as shown in ex. (5).

(5)

ˆetre

doit

This

“This drug should be taken while eating”

pris

en
by

In Sequoia, there are 39 such constructions. For
all the 30 cases in which the main verb is in active
voice, the subject of the main verb is understood
as the subject of the participle. For the 9 cases
in which the main verb is passive, for 8 of them
the subject of the participle is not present in the
sentence. Therefore, an automatic procedure tak-
ing into account the voice of the main verb should
produce only a very small number of errors.

Arbitrary control Arbitrary control is a con-
struction in which the subject of an inﬁnitive
can have any position in the sentence (Baschung,
1996).

(for inﬁnitival phrases).

In Example (6), the subject of fumer is understood
as generic while in Example (7), the subject is lui.
While by deﬁnition such control cannot be easily
resolved, such constructions are fortunately very
rare in corpora and ignoring them produces few
missing subjects of inﬁnitives.

4 Neutralizing syntactic alternations

Syntactic alternations (like passive) are known to
cause diversity in the observed linking patterns
the grammatical functions born
in corpora, i.e.
by the semantic arguments of a verb. At least
some of the existing syntactic alternations are very
general and can be identiﬁed purely on syntac-
tic grounds, without resorting to semantic disam-
biguation. In this work, we advocate for neutraliz-
ing such variation in an “enhanced-alt UD” repre-
sentation (enhanced UD representation augmented
with syntactic alternation neutralization). Follow-
ing (Candito et al., 2014; Perrier et al., 2014),
we propose to distinguish canonical versus ﬁnal
grammatical functions, and to normalize syntacti-
cally alternated verb instances by making explicit
the canonical grammatical functions of their argu-
ments. The objective is to cluster observed sub-
categorization frames into possibly one canoni-
cal frame, with thus one linking pattern between
canonical functions and semantic arguments.

We handle the French syntactic alternations
for which morpho-syntactic clues are available,
namely passive, medio-passive, impersonal and
causative. We detail these below, identifying for
each what is feasible using morpho-syntactic and
lexical clues only, and what requires semantic in-
formation.

4.1 Passive

Passive is by far the most frequent syntactic alter-
nation, and it is fortunately rather easy to identify
in a language such as French. Note that because
the UD scheme uses several labels for the same
argumental slot, depending on the argument’s cat-
egory, the basic rule of having the passive’s sub-
ject being the canonical direct object has to be
split. The nsubj:pass dependent is considered
the canonical obj. The csubj:pass dependent is

Figure 8: Passive with canonical functions made
explicit.

Although passive is identiﬁed unambiguously,
correctly identifying the argument that is subject
in the active form (the “by-phrase” in English)
is more problematic given the UD scheme.
In
French, it is introduced by a PP with preposi-
tion par (Fig. 8) or for certain verbs, with prepo-
sition de. But both prepositions can also intro-
duce adjuncts, and the current French version of
UD scheme uses the same label obl in both cases,
leading to an ambiguity concerning the argumen-
tal status of the PP. In the following, we use a more
speciﬁc obl:agent label for the by-phrases, as is
done e.g. in the UD versions of the par-TUT par-
allel treebank (Sanguinetti and Bosco, 2014) (for
English, French and Italian). We detail in sec-
tion 5 how we can obtain this labeling for the other
French UD treebanks.

4.1.1 English passive and ditransitives

Although our focus is French, we also describe
here brieﬂy how to handle passive of English di-
transitives, a case that does not exist in French.

Let us ﬁrst note that the current marking of pas-
sive in the UD scheme (nsubj versus nsubj:pass
distinction, and aux:pass label for passive aux-
iliary) is not always directly usable to link syn-
tactic arguments to semantic ones. First, passive
forms without auxiliaries are not currently marked
as such (e.g. in the planet reached by astronauts).
Second, even for a passive form with passive aux-
iliary, the recommended nsubj:pass label is am-
biguous in case of a ditransitive verb: for instance
in He was given orders and Orders were given to
him, the nsubj:pass corresponds to different se-
mantic arguments8. If we choose the double object
frame as canonical frame for ditransitives, then the
canonical labels can be made explicit as shown in
ﬁgure 9. Note that the canonical function of the

8This is already identiﬁed by Gerdes and Kahane (2016),
who advocate for directly adding the semantic argument rank
(1,2,3...) on top of the syntactic label.

nsubj:pass argument is iobj if the verb has a di-
rect object (Fig. 9a) or obj otherwise (Fig. 9b).

4.3

Impersonal

Impersonal constructions can also be viewed as
syntactic alternations:
in French the postverbal
complement has object-like properties (in partic-
ular the pronominalization with the quantitative
clitic en (of-it)).

Figure 9: Syntactic alternation normalization for
ditransitives.

4.2 Medio-passive

The French reﬂexive clitic se has various status.
Roughly, it can mean true reﬂexivization (Jean se
voit (Jean SE sees) “Jean is seeing himself”), be
part of a compound verb (s’apercevoir (to real-
ize)), or mark a valency alternation in which the
object is promoted to subject. In the latter case, the
canonical subject argument cannot be realized lo-
cally, but from the semantic point of view, an agent
is either understood (Fig. 10b) or not (Fig. 10a).
Disambiguating the status of a given se instance
is a difﬁcult task requiring semantic information.
Note though the phenomenon is not massive. For
instance in the Sequoia corpus (Candito et al.,
2014), about 5.7% of verbs bear a se clitic, among
which 16% correspond to a syntactic alternation.

Figure 10: Medio-passive, with or without under-
stood agent (The branch broke and One can break
a branch by hand)

Figure 11: Impersonal construction for sentences
“There arrived 3 people” (top) and “Three (of
them) arrived” (bottom).

The representation of such constructions in UD
is subject to debate. In the French-UD v2.0 tree-
bank, the non-referential il clitic is treated as a
nsubj, and the post-verbal argument as an ob-
ject. We thus handle impersonal constructions as
syntactic alternations (Fig. 11): the il receives an
expl label, and the post-verbal dependent receives
a canonical nsubj or csubj label (unless the verb
is passive).

4.4 Causative

Causative is another construction that can be
viewed as a syntactic alternation in French. It is
formed syntactically with a faire (to do) verb fol-
lowed by the inﬁnitive of the “caused” verb.
It
has complex properties described in a vast litter-
ature. For instance Abeill´e et al. (1997) advocate
for two competing analyses, the main one repre-
senting the faire + Vinf as a complex predicate,
with the arguments of Vinf plus an argument for
the causer, which shows as ﬁnal subject (we use
nsubj:caus as canonical function to mark it in the
enhanced UD representation). The causee, which
corresponds to the canonical subject of the Vinf,
can show as a direct object, an oblique with prepo-
sition `a or preposition par, depending on the tran-
sitivity of the Vinf, and other complex factors. So
though detecting a causative construction is trivial,
detecting which surface argument of the complex
predicate corresponds to the causee is not. We pro-
vide in Fig.12 an example of ambiguity: Zola can

be understood as the author that is read or the per-
son who reads. The phenomenon is rather rare,
e.g. occurring roughly once every 100 sentences
in the Sequoia treebank.

Figure 12: Ambiguous causative sentence, mean-
ing either “Anna makes someone read Zola” (top)
or “Anna makes Zola read” (bottom, Zola is the
canonical subject).

4.5

Interaction

Syntactic alternations can interact with all the
other “UD-enhanced” phenomena. For ease of
reading, we provide an English example in Fig. 13,
where coordination interacts with passive and a
secondary predicate construction9. We further fo-
cus on interaction between passive and added de-
pendents of verbs. For all the cases listed in sec-
tions 2 and 3 in which a subject is added to a non-
ﬁnite verb, the syntactic regularity concerns the
ﬁnal grammatical subject, which does or doesn’t
correspond to the canonical subject, depending on
the voice of the verb. We develop below two ex-
amples: (i) noun-modifying particial phrases and
(ii) control verbs.

and

noun-modifying

Passive
participial
phrases: We wrote in section 3 that a noun
modiﬁed by a participle corresponds to the subject
of the participle (Fig. 5). Yet, this generalization
only holds if subject is intended as ﬁnal subject.
Fig. 14 shows examples of past participles, with
or without auxiliaries, that modify a noun. The
noun is the semantic ﬁrst actant of the intransitive
participle (a), but the semantic second actant of
the transitive participle (b). Using the notion of
ﬁnal versus canonical grammatical functions, we
can uniformely state that in all cases, the modiﬁed

demonstrates Y to be Z, the direct object Y is not a semantic
argument of the verb. Hence the dependency between demon-
strated and its canonical object charges should be dropped in
a semantic representation.

noun is the ﬁnal subject of the participle (whether
past or present participle), and consider (i) all
present participles as active, (ii) the intransitive
participles as active, but (iii) the transitive partici-
ples as passive. For the latter, the ﬁnal subject is
the canonical object, as usual for passives.

Note that from a practical point of view,
it
is rather easy to decide whether a given noun-
modifying past participle falls under case (ii) or
(iii). Indeed, only a few intransitive verbs10 can
function as noun-modifying past participle phrases
(case (ii)), all other instances necessarily fall under
the passive case (iii).

Passive and control verbs: For control verbs
we have both a syntactic constraint and a seman-
tic (or lexical) constraint: a control verb controls
which of its semantic argument will necessarily be
the (ﬁnal) subject of the inﬁnitive. For instance,
let’s consider ﬁrst the so-called “subject control
verbs” (e.g. vouloir (to want)) or movement verbs
(e.g. venir (to come)). The canonical subject of
such verbs (ceux (those) in Fig. 15) is the ﬁnal
subject of the inﬁnitive, but its canonical subject
for active inﬁnitives (Fig. 15a and Fig. 15c) and
canonical objects for passive inﬁnitives ((15b).

For “object control verbs”, the controller (ﬁnal
subject of the inﬁnitive) is their canonical object.
This holds both for active (Fig. 16a) or passive
object control verbs (Fig. 16b). For instance in
Fig. 16b, forcer (to force) is passive, the controller
(ceux (those)) is always its canonical object, but
shows as its ﬁnal subject.

5 Producing enhanced graphs for French

UD treebanks

and

We have experimented the proposed enhanced
scheme on two French corpora of the UD project:
UD FRENCH
UD FRENCH-SEQUOIA.
UD FRENCH is in the UD projet since the version
1.0 (January 2015); data are taken from the
Google dataset (McDonald et al., 2013) where
annotations where veriﬁed by one annotator.
It
was later converted into a UD version which has
not been manually corrected systematically. Nev-
ertheless, the data were corrected and enriched in
later versions. UD FRENCH-SEQUOIA is part of
the UD project since version 2.0 (March 2017).
It was automaticaly converted from the Sequoia

tense auxiliary instead of avoir (to have).

the full process-
ing of syntactic alternations requires to disam-
biguate the argumental status of some comple-
ments: (a) which par-phrases are agents of pas-
sives, (b) which instances of the reﬂexive clitic se
correspond to an alternation promoting object to
subject, and (c) which complement of a causative
complex predicate faire+Inﬁnitive correspond to
the subject of the inﬁnitive.

For the Sequoia corpus, all this information
is already annotated in the original corpus, and
we simply had to report
it on UD FRENCH-
SEQUOIA. For UD FRENCH, we manually anno-
tated our TEST data for the three kinds of infor-
mation listed above. In the full UD FRENCH, the
number of occurences to disambiguate are: 766
for (a), 635 for (b) and 519 for (c).

tive): their canonical subject is the ﬁnal subject of

5.1 Evaluation gold corpus

For evaluating the rule-based systems, we pro-
duced a reference evaluation corpus, contain-
ing 200 sentences not used for tuning the rules
(half from UD FRENCH (UDtest) and half from
UD FRENCH-SEQUOIA (SEQtest)). The gold en-
hanced graphs were obtained in three steps: (1)
application of the two rule-based systems on the
gold UD trees, (2) manual adjudication of the two
ouputs and (3) systematic check of inﬁnitive verbs,

Below, we consider two sets of edges: N is the
set of new edges, mostly argument of verbs (drawn
in blue and above words in our ﬁgures) and A the
set of edges impacted by an alternation (namely
with a canonical function different from the ﬁ-
nal grammatical function and labeled with the ’@’
symbol in ﬁgures). Note that these two sets are not
disjoint (see for instance, Fig. 14b).

In the reference data, N represents 5.72% of the

6 Discussion and Related Works

Since the rise of large annotated corpora and given
the cost of annotations of large scale project such
as the PDT (B¨ohmov´a et al., 2003), methods
aiming at automatically enriching syntactic trees
with deeper structures have peaked a decade ago
(Hockenmaier, 2003; Cahill et al., 2004; Miyao
and Tsujii, 2005) but have then been subsumed
by purely data-driven methods when corpora with
richer annotation have been made available (Hajic
et al., 2006; Oepen et al., 2014; Mille et al., 2013).
Space is missing for an in-depth comparison be-
tween these different annotation scheme, we refer
the reader to (Rimell et al., 2009; Ivanova et al.,
2012; Candito et al., 2014; Kuhlmann and Oepen,
2016) for a more complete overview. Here, we
will focus on the differences between the Meaning
Text Theory (MTT, (Melˇcuk, 1988)), as instanced
in the recent AnCora-UPF treebank (Mille et al.,
2013; Ballesteros et al., 2016), and our proposal.

The MTT deﬁnes an explicit deep syntac-
tic representation level13, hereafter DSyntS. The
AnCora-UPF Treebank follows its four
layer
model: morphological, surface-syntactic, deep-
syntactic and semantic. The method used for an-
notating that corpus is similar to the procedure we
used. Starting from the surface-syntactic level, the
two other levels are automatically pre-annotated
step by step:
the annotation of a given level is
rewritten to the next level using the MATE tools
(Bohnet et al., 2000).

13Kahane (2003) proposed to view the deep syntactic rep-
resentation as a derivation step between surface syntax and
semantic representation.

Figure 16: Object-control verb used in active and
passive voice:
their canonical object is the ﬁnal
subject of the inﬁnitive

total number of edges in the 200 test sentences.
If we consider arguments of verbs only (the set
of core arguments of verbs and the obl relation),
edges in N represents 18.93% of the total num-
ber of verb arguments. The edges in set A are
2.77% of the total number of edges the full test
data. Again, if we consider arguments of verbs
only, these edges represent 13.91% in the 200 test
sentences.

5.2 Results and Error Analysis

We evaluated the production of enhanced UD
graphs in two settings, depending on whether the
input UD trees do (PA+) or do not (PA−) contain
manual disambiguation of cases (a), (b) and (c)
described above. For the PA− case, we applied
basic default rules instead, known to use insufﬁ-
cient information. Table 1 reports the F-measures
(computed considering all edges or N ∪ A edges
only). These results conﬁrm the validity of our
approach and highlight the consistency of the re-
sulting graphbanks. Moreover, even if manual pre-
annotations are required in theory, we empirically
observe that they concern a small number of cases
and their effect is marginal (the difference between
PA− and PA+ settings is low).

The error analysis shows that the GREW and
OGRE systems have different weak points. Of the
52 errors produced by OGRE, 30 were due to a
lack of distribution of the governor or dependents
on the conjuncts of a coordination, while it missed
5 subjects of inﬁnitives only. For GREW, the re-
sult is opposite. Only 4 errors out of 28 relate
to the distribution of dependencies within a co-

The DSyntS produced by Ballesteros et al.
(2016) share important properties with our ex-
tented enhanced UD graphs, in that they neutral-
ize syntactic alternations. However, they do not
contain additional arcs for argument sharing, as
subjects of inﬁnitives for instance, as they stick to
tree structures. Besides the choice of represen-
tation structures, graphs in our cases, trees in the
other, important differences remain: Another dif-
ference concerns the dependency labels for argu-
ments: canonical function labels (nsubj, obj etc...)
in our case versus “argument relations” for MTT,
namely numbers (I, II, III etc...), ordered using a
“growing obliquity” order (Iordanskaja and Mel-
cuk, 2000). These numbers do not have a mean-
ing per se, and are intended to be read within a
lexical entry linking them to syntactic realizations.
We note that using argument numbering in a deep
syntactic representation, hence in the absence of
word sense disambiguation, leads to the loss of
plain syntactic information useful for disambigua-
tion. For example in French: apprendre is ambigu-
ous between to learn as in X apprend Y de Z, and
to teach, as in X apprend Y `a Z. Both senses en-
tail different subcategorization frames (subj, obj,
obl:de) vs (subj, obj, obl:`a), but bear the same ar-
gument numbers in the MTT (I, II, III), the mean-
ing of III being too underspeciﬁed in the absence
of semantic disambiguation14.

7 Conclusion

We proposed extensions of the current enhanced
universal dependencies scheme. We advocated in
particular for neutralizing syntactic alternations, in
order to limit the diversity of observed subcate-
gorization frames for a given verb, while staying
at the syntactic level, without resorting to word
sense disambiguation. We implemented rule-
based modules to obtain enhanced graphs from
French UD trees. Evaluation on a 200-sentence
sample shows we obtain over 90% of F-measure
on the enhanced edges (edges not present in the
input UD tree). Moreover, we report a 19% pro-
portion of enhanced edges among the edges for ar-
guments of verbs, meaning that the saturation of

14One of the anonymous reviewers pointed that because in
UD some labels are distinguished according to the category
of the dependent (e.g. nsubj vs. csubj), the MTT labels
would still better account for linking regularities. While we
do agree that the UD label distinctions multiply linking pat-
terns maybe uselessly, we believe that on the other hand, the
MTT deep labels do add ambiguity, and are thus insufﬁcient
per se.

predicate-argument structures for verbs concerns
a non negligible amount of arguments. We hope
this proposal can be tested on other languages, the
most obvious ones being the Romance languages,
which show very similar syntactic alternations.
We position this proposal within the UD frame-
work and remain compatible with all choices al-
ready made by the current speciﬁcations (Nivre et
al., 2016; Schuster and Manning, 2016). More-
over, our de-facto adhesion to the CONLL-U rep-
resentation format allows for a straight-forward
use by current data-driven graph parsers. We leave
this promising path of study to further work.

Abstract

The 2.0 release of the Universal Depen-
dency treebanks demonstrates the effec-
tiveness of the UD scheme to cope with
very diverse languages. The next step
would be to get more of syntactic anal-
ysis, and the “enhanced dependencies”
sketched in the UD 2.0 guidelines is a
promising attempt in that direction.
In
this work we propose to go further and
enrich the enhanced dependency scheme
along two axis: extending the cases of re-
covered arguments of non-ﬁnite verbs, and
neutralizing syntactic alternations. Do-
ing so leads to both richer and more uni-
form structures, while remaining at the
syntactic level, and thus rather neutral
with respect to the type of semantic rep-
resentation that can be further obtained.
We implemented this proposal in two UD
treebanks of French, using deterministic
graph-rewriting rules. Evaluation on a 200
sentence gold standard shows that deep
syntactic graphs can be obtained from sur-
face syntax annotations with a high accu-
racy. Among all arguments of verbs in
the gold standard, 13.91% are impacted
by syntactic alternation normalization, and
18.93% are additional deep edges.

1 Introduction

initiative (UD,
The Universal Dependencies
(Nivre et al., 2016)) is one of the major achieve-
ments of the last few years in the NLP ﬁeld. Orig-
inating from the need of a better interopability
in cross-language settings for downstream tasks
(Petrov et al., 2011; McDonald et al., 2013), it
has gathered dozens of international teams who

released annotated versions of their treebanks, fol-
lowing the UD annotation scheme.

Although UD has raised criticisms, both on the
suitability of the scheme to meet linguistic typol-
ogy (Croft et al., 2017) and on the current imple-
mentation of the UD treebanks (Gerdes and Ka-
hane, 2016), the existence of many treebanks with
same syntactic scheme does however ease cross-
language linguistic analysis and enables parsers
to generalize across languages at training time, as
demonstrated by Ammar et al. (2016).

The UD scheme favors dependencies between
content words, in order to maximize parallelism
between languages. Although this results in de-
pendencies that are more semantic-oriented, the
UD scheme lies at the surface syntax level and thus
necessarily lacks abstraction over syntactic varia-
tion and does not ﬁt all downstream applications’
needs (Schuster and Manning, 2016).

This is partly why de Marneffe and Manning
(2008) proposed a decade ago, in the Stanford De-
pendencies framework, several schemes with var-
ious semantic-oriented modiﬁcations of syntactic

structures.
representation layer1 has
recently started to be
extended and implemented as “Enhanced Depen-
dencies” in the UD scheme family (Schuster and
Manning, 2016). Current UD speciﬁcations leave
open the possibility to include phenomena (cf.
section 2) that make explicit additional predicate-
argument dependencies. In practice, most current
UD treebanks contain either very few or no en-
hanced dependencies at all2.

the collapsed
scheme is the furthest away from the plain dependency tree.

including enhanced dependencies is available within the
Stanford parser (https://nlp.stanford.edu/software/stanford-
dependencies.shtml).

Pisa, Italy, September 18-20 2017

Of course, as noted by Kuhlmann and Oepen
(2016), competing proposals for deep syntactic
graphs already exist and are implemented through
in some few cases, multilingual
diverse and,
graphbanks.
More clearly semantic schemes
seem to depend on the needs of the downstream
application or impose their own constraints on the
syntactic layer it is either built upon or plugged in.
See for example the differences between abstract
meaning representations (Knight et al., 2014), de-
signed with Machine Translation in sight, and the
UDEPLAMBDA’s logical structures, very recently
proposed by Reddy et al. (2017) and evaluated on
a question-answering over a knowledge base task.
In this paper, we build on the work of (Can-
dito et al., 2014; Perrier et al., 2014) to propose
an extension to the current enhanced dependency
framework of Schuster and Manning (2016). First,
we extend the types of argumental dependencies
made explicit (taking into account participles, con-
trol nouns and adjectives, non-ﬁnite verbs and
more cases of inﬁnitive verbs). Second, we neu-
tralize syntactic alternations,
in order to make
linking patterns more regular for a given verb
form. We believe that making explicit and normal-
ize the predicate-argument structures, still remain-
ing at the syntactic level, can make downstream
semantic analysis more straightforward (as shown
for instance in (Michalon et al., 2016)), while re-
maining neutral with respect to what exact seman-
tic representation can be further derived.

The originality of our approach is to neutral-
ize syntactic alternations using canonical gram-
matical functions, which render linking patterns of
verbs more regular but are still syntactic in nature,
unlike what can be found for example in the tecto-
grammatical layer of the Prague Dependency bank
(Hajic et al., 2006).

This proposal is currently being implemented
for French, and tested on two UD treebanks (Can-
dito et al., 2014; Nivre et al., 2016) by the means
of a rule-based deterministic process. We evalu-
ated the deep syntactic graphs automatically con-
verted from gold UD trees and obtained a 94%
F-measure on a two-hundred sentences gold stan-
dard, similar to what reported Candito et al. (2014)
on a similar task. Both treebanks and building
rules are made available3 to foster further work
in other languages and to gather the opinion and
criticisms of the community regarding the level of

abstraction we should reach when it comes to deep
syntax representation.
In the following, we ﬁrst brieﬂy introduce the cur-
rent Enhanced UD scheme, we detail extensions
concerning arguments of non-ﬁnite verbs in sec-
tion 3 and syntactic alternations for French in sec-
tion 4. We present and evaluate a system to obtain
enhanced graphs for French in section 5. We then
discuss related work and conclude.

2 Enhanced UD representation

The current version of universal dependencies
guidelines (v2.0) includes an enhanced dependen-
cies section4, leaving the possibility for UD tree-
banks to include all or only some of the following
phenomena:

1. Additional subject relations for control and

raising constructions
2. Propagation of conjuncts
3. Antecedent of relative pronouns in noun-

modifying relative clauses

4. Modiﬁer labels that contain the preposition or

other case-marking information
5. Null nodes for elided predicates

In our implementation for French, we cope with
the two ﬁrst phenomena. Phenomena 3 and 4
are quite systematic and may be handled auto-
matically and phenomenon 5 requires manual an-
notation. Note that while enhanced dependen-
cies (as were Stanford dependencies) are moti-
vated by downstream semantically-oriented appli-
cations, they remain syntactic in nature in their
current stage. This results in keeping syntac-
tic dependents that are not semantic arguments
of their syntactic head, in classic cases of syn-
tax/semantics mismatch. So for instance, sub-
jects of raising verbs are not removed from the
enhanced UD graph, although they are not a se-
mantic argument of the raising verb, as shown in
Fig. 1.

Figure 1: Raising verb

Following the work of Candito et al. (2014) and
Perrier et al. (2014), we propose two extensions,

4http://universaldependencies.org/u/overview/

3http://github.com/bguil/Depling2017

enhanced-syntax.html

that we detail in the next two sections:
the ﬁrst
one is to extend the cases for which arguments
are added to inﬁnitive verbs and more generally
to non-ﬁnite verbs. The second one concerns the
neutralisation of syntactic alternations.

3 Recovering arguments of non-ﬁnite

verbs

The aim of enhancing UD dependencies is to fa-
cilitate the computation of predicate-argument re-
lations at the semantic level. In this perspective,
we propose to go beyond the explicitation of con-
trol and raising verbs subjects. We detail below
other cases of obligatory syntactic control, and
cases which are not as systematic but which prove
feasible with rather high accuracy using heuristics.

3.1 Cases fully determined by syntax

“Control nouns”
In French, some nouns take a
nominal and an inﬁnitive argument, that can be
both realized within the NP or as a predicative
complement (Fig. 2).
In both cases, the subject
of the inﬁnitive is the nominal argument.

Figure 2: Paul’s intention is to ﬁnish early

The preposition introducing the inﬁnitival
clause is determined by the control noun. It is gen-
erally de, more rarely `a, as in example (1).

(1)

votre
your

capacit´e
capacity

`a
to

conduire
drive

un
a

v´ehicule
vehicle

“Control adjectives” Control adjectives take an
inﬁnitive complement, whose understood subject
is the noun to which the adjective applies, as
shown in Fig. 3.

Figure 3: Control adjective

Tough movement Tough movement describes
constructions in which an adjective has an inﬁni-
tive as complement and the noun to which the ad-
jective applies is the direct object of the inﬁnitive.

The adjective can be attributive or used as a pred-
icative adjective (Fig. 4)5. These cases are easy to
detect using available lists of tough adjectives6.

Figure 4: Tough movement

Noun-modifying participles When a past or
present participle modiﬁes a noun, the noun is the
understood subject of the participle (Fig. 5).

Figure 5: Noun-modifying participles

Inﬁnitives behaving as noun modiﬁers
In
French, a transitive inﬁnitival clause introduced
with the preposition `a can be the argument of the
noun (as in example (1) in the “control nouns” sec-
tion above, the noun capacit´e (ability) takes two
arguments, the entity having the ability, and an in-
ﬁnitival clause describing what it is able of). But
for any noun, an inﬁnitival clause introduced by
`a can function as an adjunct modifying the noun,
which is understood as either the object (Fig. 6) or
the subject (examples (2) and (3)), depending on
the transitivity of the inﬁnitive.

as the object of the inﬁnitive

5Note in this case, the modiﬁed noun is not a semantic
argument of the adjective, the dependency between difﬁcile
(difﬁcult) and livre (book) should be dropped in a semantic
representation.

6A few “tough nouns” exist too, as in ce livre est un plaisir

`a lire (this book is a pleasure to read).

3.2 Cases requiring semantic or world

knowledge

The cases we just saw correspond to situations of
obligatory control, in which the argument to add to
the non-ﬁnite verb can be deterministically iden-
tiﬁed, given the syntactic construction, and given
the speciﬁc control or raising verb, control noun or
adjective. Other constructions involving an non-
ﬁnite verb are ambiguous with respect to which
non-local argument is understood as the argument
of the verb. In some of these cases though, among
all the potential positions for the non-local argu-
ment to retreive is particularly more frequent, al-
though not strictly obligatory. For the cases de-
tailed in this section, we performed a systematic
study of the occurrences in the Sequoia corpus,
and concluded that simple heuristics could be used
for retreiving the non-local argument of a non-
ﬁnite verb with sufﬁcient accuracy.

7We did not ﬁnd any such exception in the Sequoia cor-
pus. The following built up example shows one: Ext´enu´es, on
les a envoy´es dormir. (Exhausted, we them have sent to-sleep)
“Exhausted, they were sent to bed”).

We performed an in-depth study of these cases,
using the deep Sequoia corpus (Candito et al.,
2014), in which all subjects of inﬁnitive verbs
present in the sentence are marked. Breaking
down the 143 inﬁnitive heads of adverbial clauses
according to the voice of the main verb, we obtain
the following results:

• main verb in the active voice: there are 114
cases and among them, the subject of the in-
ﬁnitive is the subject of the main verb in 95
cases; in the 16 remaining cases, the subject
of the inﬁnitive is absent of the sentence;
• main verb in passive voice (or modal intro-
ducing a passive): there are 29 cases; in 11
cases, the subject of the inﬁnitive is the sub-
ject of the main verb; in the 18 remaining
cases, the subject of the inﬁnitive is a virtual
agent of the passive verb, which is not present
in the sentence;

• main verb in medio-passive voice: there are
3 cases, in which the subject of the inﬁnitive
is not present in the sentence.

A heuristic that triggers the sharing for active main
verbs only will obtain a 90% recall and 83% pre-
cision only.

In a similar construction, a present participle in-
troduced with a preposition (en in French and by
in English) plays the role of a modiﬁer for a main
verb. The subject of the participle is generally the
subject of the main verb but again, this does not
hold if the main verb is in passive voice (or is a
modal introducing a passive, as shown in ex. (5).

In Sequoia, there are 39 such constructions. For
all the 30 cases in which the main verb is in active
voice, the subject of the main verb is understood
as the subject of the participle. For the 9 cases
in which the main verb is passive, for 8 of them
the subject of the participle is not present in the
sentence. Therefore, an automatic procedure tak-
ing into account the voice of the main verb should
produce only a very small number of errors.

Arbitrary control Arbitrary control is a con-
struction in which the subject of an inﬁnitive
can have any position in the sentence (Baschung,
1996).

In Example (6), the subject of fumer is understood

While by deﬁnition such control cannot be easily
resolved, such constructions are fortunately very
rare in corpora and ignoring them produces few
missing subjects of inﬁnitives.

4 Neutralizing syntactic alternations

Syntactic alternations (like passive) are known to
cause diversity in the observed linking patterns
the grammatical functions born
in corpora, i.e.
by the semantic arguments of a verb. At least
some of the existing syntactic alternations are very
general and can be identiﬁed purely on syntac-
tic grounds, without resorting to semantic disam-
biguation. In this work, we advocate for neutraliz-
ing such variation in an “enhanced-alt UD” repre-
sentation (enhanced UD representation augmented
with syntactic alternation neutralization). Follow-
ing (Candito et al., 2014; Perrier et al., 2014),
we propose to distinguish canonical versus ﬁnal
grammatical functions, and to normalize syntacti-
cally alternated verb instances by making explicit
the canonical grammatical functions of their argu-
ments. The objective is to cluster observed sub-
categorization frames into possibly one canoni-
cal frame, with thus one linking pattern between
canonical functions and semantic arguments.

We handle the French syntactic alternations
for which morpho-syntactic clues are available,
namely passive, medio-passive, impersonal and
causative. We detail these below, identifying for
each what is feasible using morpho-syntactic and
lexical clues only, and what requires semantic in-
formation.

4.1 Passive

Passive is by far the most frequent syntactic alter-
nation, and it is fortunately rather easy to identify
in a language such as French. Note that because
the UD scheme uses several labels for the same
argumental slot, depending on the argument’s cat-
egory, the basic rule of having the passive’s sub-
ject being the canonical direct object has to be
split. The nsubj:pass dependent is considered
the canonical obj. The csubj:pass dependent is

Figure 8: Passive with canonical functions made
explicit.

Although passive is identiﬁed unambiguously,
correctly identifying the argument that is subject
in the active form (the “by-phrase” in English)
is more problematic given the UD scheme.
In
French, it is introduced by a PP with preposi-
tion par (Fig. 8) or for certain verbs, with prepo-
sition de. But both prepositions can also intro-
duce adjuncts, and the current French version of
UD scheme uses the same label obl in both cases,
leading to an ambiguity concerning the argumen-
tal status of the PP. In the following, we use a more
speciﬁc obl:agent label for the by-phrases, as is
done e.g. in the UD versions of the par-TUT par-
allel treebank (Sanguinetti and Bosco, 2014) (for
English, French and Italian). We detail in sec-
tion 5 how we can obtain this labeling for the other
French UD treebanks.

4.1.1 English passive and ditransitives

Although our focus is French, we also describe
here brieﬂy how to handle passive of English di-
transitives, a case that does not exist in French.

Let us ﬁrst note that the current marking of pas-
sive in the UD scheme (nsubj versus nsubj:pass
distinction, and aux:pass label for passive aux-
iliary) is not always directly usable to link syn-
tactic arguments to semantic ones. First, passive
forms without auxiliaries are not currently marked
as such (e.g. in the planet reached by astronauts).
Second, even for a passive form with passive aux-
iliary, the recommended nsubj:pass label is am-
biguous in case of a ditransitive verb: for instance
in He was given orders and Orders were given to
him, the nsubj:pass corresponds to different se-
mantic arguments8. If we choose the double object
frame as canonical frame for ditransitives, then the
canonical labels can be made explicit as shown in
ﬁgure 9. Note that the canonical function of the

8This is already identiﬁed by Gerdes and Kahane (2016),
who advocate for directly adding the semantic argument rank
(1,2,3...) on top of the syntactic label.

nsubj:pass argument is iobj if the verb has a di-
rect object (Fig. 9a) or obj otherwise (Fig. 9b).

4.3

Impersonal

Impersonal constructions can also be viewed as
syntactic alternations:
in French the postverbal
complement has object-like properties (in partic-
ular the pronominalization with the quantitative
clitic en (of-it)).

Figure 9: Syntactic alternation normalization for
ditransitives.

4.2 Medio-passive

The French reﬂexive clitic se has various status.
Roughly, it can mean true reﬂexivization (Jean se
voit (Jean SE sees) “Jean is seeing himself”), be
part of a compound verb (s’apercevoir (to real-
ize)), or mark a valency alternation in which the
object is promoted to subject. In the latter case, the
canonical subject argument cannot be realized lo-
cally, but from the semantic point of view, an agent
is either understood (Fig. 10b) or not (Fig. 10a).
Disambiguating the status of a given se instance
is a difﬁcult task requiring semantic information.
Note though the phenomenon is not massive. For
instance in the Sequoia corpus (Candito et al.,
2014), about 5.7% of verbs bear a se clitic, among
which 16% correspond to a syntactic alternation.

Figure 10: Medio-passive, with or without under-
stood agent (The branch broke and One can break
a branch by hand)

Figure 11: Impersonal construction for sentences
“There arrived 3 people” (top) and “Three (of
them) arrived” (bottom).

The representation of such constructions in UD
is subject to debate. In the French-UD v2.0 tree-
bank, the non-referential il clitic is treated as a
nsubj, and the post-verbal argument as an ob-
ject. We thus handle impersonal constructions as
syntactic alternations (Fig. 11): the il receives an
expl label, and the post-verbal dependent receives
a canonical nsubj or csubj label (unless the verb
is passive).

4.4 Causative

Causative is another construction that can be
viewed as a syntactic alternation in French. It is
formed syntactically with a faire (to do) verb fol-
lowed by the inﬁnitive of the “caused” verb.
It
has complex properties described in a vast litter-
ature. For instance Abeill´e et al. (1997) advocate
for two competing analyses, the main one repre-
senting the faire + Vinf as a complex predicate,
with the arguments of Vinf plus an argument for
the causer, which shows as ﬁnal subject (we use
nsubj:caus as canonical function to mark it in the
enhanced UD representation). The causee, which
corresponds to the canonical subject of the Vinf,
can show as a direct object, an oblique with prepo-
sition `a or preposition par, depending on the tran-
sitivity of the Vinf, and other complex factors. So
though detecting a causative construction is trivial,
detecting which surface argument of the complex
predicate corresponds to the causee is not. We pro-
vide in Fig.12 an example of ambiguity: Zola can

be understood as the author that is read or the per-
son who reads. The phenomenon is rather rare,
e.g. occurring roughly once every 100 sentences
in the Sequoia treebank.

Figure 12: Ambiguous causative sentence, mean-
ing either “Anna makes someone read Zola” (top)
or “Anna makes Zola read” (bottom, Zola is the
canonical subject).

4.5

Interaction

Syntactic alternations can interact with all the
other “UD-enhanced” phenomena. For ease of
reading, we provide an English example in Fig. 13,
where coordination interacts with passive and a
secondary predicate construction9. We further fo-
cus on interaction between passive and added de-
pendents of verbs. For all the cases listed in sec-
tions 2 and 3 in which a subject is added to a non-
ﬁnite verb, the syntactic regularity concerns the
ﬁnal grammatical subject, which does or doesn’t
correspond to the canonical subject, depending on
the voice of the verb. We develop below two ex-
amples: (i) noun-modifying particial phrases and
(ii) control verbs.

and

noun-modifying

Passive
participial
phrases: We wrote in section 3 that a noun
modiﬁed by a participle corresponds to the subject
of the participle (Fig. 5). Yet, this generalization
only holds if subject is intended as ﬁnal subject.
Fig. 14 shows examples of past participles, with
or without auxiliaries, that modify a noun. The
noun is the semantic ﬁrst actant of the intransitive
participle (a), but the semantic second actant of
the transitive participle (b). Using the notion of
ﬁnal versus canonical grammatical functions, we
can uniformely state that in all cases, the modiﬁed

9Note that for the secondary predicate construction X
demonstrates Y to be Z, the direct object Y is not a semantic
argument of the verb. Hence the dependency between demon-
strated and its canonical object charges should be dropped in
a semantic representation.

noun is the ﬁnal subject of the participle (whether
past or present participle), and consider (i) all
present participles as active, (ii) the intransitive
participles as active, but (iii) the transitive partici-
ples as passive. For the latter, the ﬁnal subject is
the canonical object, as usual for passives.

Note that from a practical point of view,
it
is rather easy to decide whether a given noun-
modifying past participle falls under case (ii) or
(iii). Indeed, only a few intransitive verbs10 can
function as noun-modifying past participle phrases
(case (ii)), all other instances necessarily fall under
the passive case (iii).

Passive and control verbs: For control verbs
we have both a syntactic constraint and a seman-
tic (or lexical) constraint: a control verb controls
which of its semantic argument will necessarily be
the (ﬁnal) subject of the inﬁnitive. For instance,
let’s consider ﬁrst the so-called “subject control
verbs” (e.g. vouloir (to want)) or movement verbs
(e.g. venir (to come)). The canonical subject of
such verbs (ceux (those) in Fig. 15) is the ﬁnal
subject of the inﬁnitive, but its canonical subject
for active inﬁnitives (Fig. 15a and Fig. 15c) and
canonical objects for passive inﬁnitives ((15b).

For “object control verbs”, the controller (ﬁnal
subject of the inﬁnitive) is their canonical object.
This holds both for active (Fig. 16a) or passive
object control verbs (Fig. 16b). For instance in
Fig. 16b, forcer (to force) is passive, the controller
(ceux (those)) is always its canonical object, but
shows as its ﬁnal subject.

5 Producing enhanced graphs for French

UD treebanks

and

We have experimented the proposed enhanced
scheme on two French corpora of the UD project:
UD FRENCH
UD FRENCH-SEQUOIA.
UD FRENCH is in the UD projet since the version
1.0 (January 2015); data are taken from the
Google dataset (McDonald et al., 2013) where
annotations where veriﬁed by one annotator.
It
was later converted into a UD version which has
not been manually corrected systematically. Nev-
ertheless, the data were corrected and enriched in
later versions. UD FRENCH-SEQUOIA is part of
the UD project since version 2.0 (March 2017).
It was automaticaly converted from the Sequoia

tense auxiliary instead of avoir (to have).

the full process-
ing of syntactic alternations requires to disam-
biguate the argumental status of some comple-
ments: (a) which par-phrases are agents of pas-
sives, (b) which instances of the reﬂexive clitic se
correspond to an alternation promoting object to
subject, and (c) which complement of a causative
complex predicate faire+Inﬁnitive correspond to
the subject of the inﬁnitive.

For the Sequoia corpus, all this information
is already annotated in the original corpus, and
we simply had to report
it on UD FRENCH-
SEQUOIA. For UD FRENCH, we manually anno-
tated our TEST data for the three kinds of infor-
mation listed above. In the full UD FRENCH, the
number of occurences to disambiguate are: 766
for (a), 635 for (b) and 519 for (c).

5.1 Evaluation gold corpus

For evaluating the rule-based systems, we pro-
duced a reference evaluation corpus, contain-
ing 200 sentences not used for tuning the rules
(half from UD FRENCH (UDtest) and half from
UD FRENCH-SEQUOIA (SEQtest)). The gold en-
hanced graphs were obtained in three steps: (1)
application of the two rule-based systems on the
gold UD trees, (2) manual adjudication of the two
ouputs and (3) systematic check of inﬁnitive verbs,
past or present participles and coordinations.

Below, we consider two sets of edges: N is the
set of new edges, mostly argument of verbs (drawn
in blue and above words in our ﬁgures) and A the
set of edges impacted by an alternation (namely
with a canonical function different from the ﬁ-
nal grammatical function and labeled with the ’@’
symbol in ﬁgures). Note that these two sets are not
disjoint (see for instance, Fig. 14b).

In the reference data, N represents 5.72% of the

6 Discussion and Related Works

Since the rise of large annotated corpora and given
the cost of annotations of large scale project such
as the PDT (B¨ohmov´a et al., 2003), methods
aiming at automatically enriching syntactic trees
with deeper structures have peaked a decade ago
(Hockenmaier, 2003; Cahill et al., 2004; Miyao
and Tsujii, 2005) but have then been subsumed
by purely data-driven methods when corpora with
richer annotation have been made available (Hajic
et al., 2006; Oepen et al., 2014; Mille et al., 2013).
Space is missing for an in-depth comparison be-
tween these different annotation scheme, we refer
the reader to (Rimell et al., 2009; Ivanova et al.,
2012; Candito et al., 2014; Kuhlmann and Oepen,
2016) for a more complete overview. Here, we
will focus on the differences between the Meaning
Text Theory (MTT, (Melˇcuk, 1988)), as instanced
in the recent AnCora-UPF treebank (Mille et al.,
2013; Ballesteros et al., 2016), and our proposal.

The MTT deﬁnes an explicit deep syntac-
tic representation level13, hereafter DSyntS. The
AnCora-UPF Treebank follows its four
layer
model: morphological, surface-syntactic, deep-
syntactic and semantic. The method used for an-
notating that corpus is similar to the procedure we
used. Starting from the surface-syntactic level, the
two other levels are automatically pre-annotated
step by step:
the annotation of a given level is
rewritten to the next level using the MATE tools
(Bohnet et al., 2000).

13Kahane (2003) proposed to view the deep syntactic rep-
resentation as a derivation step between surface syntax and
semantic representation.

Figure 16: Object-control verb used in active and
passive voice:
their canonical object is the ﬁnal
subject of the inﬁnitive

total number of edges in the 200 test sentences.
If we consider arguments of verbs only (the set
of core arguments of verbs and the obl relation),
edges in N represents 18.93% of the total num-
ber of verb arguments. The edges in set A are
2.77% of the total number of edges the full test
data. Again, if we consider arguments of verbs
only, these edges represent 13.91% in the 200 test
sentences.

5.2 Results and Error Analysis

We evaluated the production of enhanced UD
graphs in two settings, depending on whether the
input UD trees do (PA+) or do not (PA−) contain
manual disambiguation of cases (a), (b) and (c)
described above. For the PA− case, we applied
basic default rules instead, known to use insufﬁ-
cient information. Table 1 reports the F-measures
(computed considering all edges or N ∪ A edges
only). These results conﬁrm the validity of our
approach and highlight the consistency of the re-
sulting graphbanks. Moreover, even if manual pre-
annotations are required in theory, we empirically
observe that they concern a small number of cases
and their effect is marginal (the difference between
PA− and PA+ settings is low).

The error analysis shows that the GREW and
OGRE systems have different weak points. Of the
52 errors produced by OGRE, 30 were due to a
lack of distribution of the governor or dependents
on the conjuncts of a coordination, while it missed
5 subjects of inﬁnitives only. For GREW, the re-
sult is opposite. Only 4 errors out of 28 relate
to the distribution of dependencies within a co-

The DSyntS produced by Ballesteros et al.
(2016) share important properties with our ex-
tented enhanced UD graphs, in that they neutral-
ize syntactic alternations. However, they do not
contain additional arcs for argument sharing, as
subjects of inﬁnitives for instance, as they stick to
tree structures. Besides the choice of represen-
tation structures, graphs in our cases, trees in the
other, important differences remain: Another dif-
ference concerns the dependency labels for argu-
ments: canonical function labels (nsubj, obj etc...)
in our case versus “argument relations” for MTT,
namely numbers (I, II, III etc...), ordered using a
“growing obliquity” order (Iordanskaja and Mel-
cuk, 2000). These numbers do not have a mean-
ing per se, and are intended to be read within a
lexical entry linking them to syntactic realizations.
We note that using argument numbering in a deep
syntactic representation, hence in the absence of
word sense disambiguation, leads to the loss of
plain syntactic information useful for disambigua-
tion. For example in French: apprendre is ambigu-
ous between to learn as in X apprend Y de Z, and
to teach, as in X apprend Y `a Z. Both senses en-
tail different subcategorization frames (subj, obj,
obl:de) vs (subj, obj, obl:`a), but bear the same ar-
gument numbers in the MTT (I, II, III), the mean-
ing of III being too underspeciﬁed in the absence
of semantic disambiguation14.

7 Conclusion

We proposed extensions of the current enhanced
universal dependencies scheme. We advocated in
particular for neutralizing syntactic alternations, in
order to limit the diversity of observed subcate-
gorization frames for a given verb, while staying
at the syntactic level, without resorting to word
sense disambiguation. We implemented rule-
based modules to obtain enhanced graphs from
French UD trees. Evaluation on a 200-sentence
sample shows we obtain over 90% of F-measure
on the enhanced edges (edges not present in the
input UD tree). Moreover, we report a 19% pro-
portion of enhanced edges among the edges for ar-
guments of verbs, meaning that the saturation of

14One of the anonymous reviewers pointed that because in
UD some labels are distinguished according to the category
of the dependent (e.g. nsubj vs. csubj), the MTT labels
would still better account for linking regularities. While we
do agree that the UD label distinctions multiply linking pat-
terns maybe uselessly, we believe that on the other hand, the
MTT deep labels do add ambiguity, and are thus insufﬁcient
per se.

predicate-argument structures for verbs concerns
a non negligible amount of arguments. We hope
this proposal can be tested on other languages, the
most obvious ones being the Romance languages,
which show very similar syntactic alternations.
We position this proposal within the UD frame-
work and remain compatible with all choices al-
ready made by the current speciﬁcations (Nivre et
al., 2016; Schuster and Manning, 2016). More-
over, our de-facto adhesion to the CONLL-U rep-
resentation format allows for a straight-forward
use by current data-driven graph parsers. We leave
this promising path of study to further work.
