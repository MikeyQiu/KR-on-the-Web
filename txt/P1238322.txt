Abstract

We study German afﬁxoids, a type of morpheme in between afﬁxes and free stems. Several prop-
erties have been associated with them – increased productivity; a bleached semantics, which is
often evaluative and/or intensifying and thus of relevance to sentiment analysis; and the existence
of a free morpheme counterpart – but not been validated empirically. In experiments on a new
data set that we make available, we put these key assumptions from the morphological literature
to the test and show that despite the fact that afﬁxoids generate many low-frequency formations,
we can classify these as afﬁxoid or non-afﬁxoid instances with a best F1-score of 74%.

Introduction

In this work, we study a subset of complex German words that includes many hapaxes, namely items that
have as one of their morphological components a so-called afﬁxoid or semi-afﬁx. Examples of afﬁxoid
formations include Gesetzeshengst ‘jobsworth, stickler for the letter of the law’ [lit. ‘law/legal stallion’]
or Mentalit¨atsmonster ‘person with laser focus’ [lit. ‘mentality monster’]. The class of afﬁxoid mor-
phemes sits in between afﬁxes and stems. While various criteria have been proposed to identify afﬁxoids
(Schmidt, 1987), at least the following three are widely taken for granted (ten Hacken, 2000; Elsen,
2009): (i) increased productivity; (ii) semantic bleaching/decreased semantic speciﬁcity; and (iii) an et-
ymological and formal link to an existing free stem. The ﬁrst two criteria are applied by comparing the
afﬁxoid to its corresponding free stem. For instance, in Weingott ‘deity of wine’, Gott is a free morpheme
occurring with its regular meaning; in Gitarrengott ‘guitar god’, Gott is an afﬁxoid: the whole word does
not refer to a deity but to a talented human guitar player. Such evaluative or intensifying meanings are a
hallmark of afﬁxoids (Meibauer, 2013). The last of the three criteria distinguishes afﬁxoids from afﬁxes,
which by deﬁnition occur only bound to other morphemes. For example, German -heit, whose English
cognate is -hood as in falsehood, is an afﬁx: there is no longer a related free form. By contrast, German
-gott is an afﬁxoid since there is a related free form Gott, cognate with English god.

Research on afﬁxoids has been centered on Germanic languages like German, Dutch and Swedish
(Ascoop and Leuschner, 2006; Booij, 2005; Booij and H¨uning, 2014; Norde and Van Goethem, 2014).
However, we believe afﬁxoids are not an exclusive feature of these languages. They are likely to arise in
other languages with productive compounding. For English, for instance, there is little to no systematic
research but arguably quality (as in quality press/furniture/diamonds but not in quality management) and
nut (as in health/math/trivia nut but not in pecan nut) can be considered English afﬁxoids. Even for
languages on which there is more research, that work is typically focused on the theoretical relevance
of assuming a category of afﬁxoids that is distinct from afﬁxes on the one hand and compounds on the
other. Very little quantitative work using corpus data has been done to, for instance, study the level of
productivity for different afﬁxoid candidates or to substantiate the intuition that most afﬁxoid uses carry
evaluative meanings. Our work thus ﬁlls an empirical gap in the theoretical discussion.

In addition, we are interested in studying afﬁxoids for the purposes of sentiment analysis. On the
one hand, theoretical linguistic work that notes the expressive function of afﬁxoids such as Meibauer

(2013) suggests this. On the other hand, it is known from prior research on sentiment analysis that hapax
words in general are often subjective (Wiebe et al., 2004). As we show in §3, afﬁxoids tend to generate
many (near-)hapax forms, which meshes with observations on their productivity in the morphological
literature and the general expectation about the Zipﬁan distribution of word frequencies. Since hapaxes,
by deﬁnition, cannot be readily analyzed based on their distribution in corpora, it would be very useful
if we could make use of their intrinsic properties to classify such forms as afﬁxoid uses (and therefore
likely subjective) or not.

The main task that we set ourselves in this paper is morpheme sense disambiguation: we want to
classify complex forms containing possible afﬁxoids as to whether the morphemes in question really
occur as afﬁxoids with special meanings or as regular morphemes with their full, common semantics.
We frame this task as a binary classiﬁcation problem. The major contributions of our paper are:

• a gold standard annotation of complex forms containing potential afﬁxoids, which make publicly

• empirical validation of claims regarding the association between intensiﬁcation / evaluation and

• a detailed examination of various novel features that have been devised to detect the presence of an

2 Related work

Recently, Ruppenhofer et al. (2017) studied the problem of how well the polarity of complex words,
including both compounds and derived forms, can be predicted based on its components and the word’s
morphological structure. They found that, while on core vocabulary – deﬁned as items listed in the PolArt
dictionary (Klenner et al., 2009) and highly likely to be listed in GermaNet (Hamp and Feldweg, 1997),
the German WordNet resource – classiﬁcation accuracy was as high as 85%, performance was severely
degraded on more colloquial, domain-speciﬁc and linguistically creative forms taken from Wiktionary2
and the Wortwarte3 neologism project. Note that this research did not distinguish true compounds from
complex forms involving afﬁxoids.

Similar research was carried out earlier by Moilanen and Pulman (2008) who evaluated how well it was
possible to classify unknown English words into one of three polarity classes based on morphological
analysis. Compared to these prior efforts, our task is narrower as we do not deal with derivation and do
not predict polarity for the complex entries. Our data is also more focused since we have only complex
forms containing exactly two nouns and the second components of our data represent only 7 different
lemmas. And importantly, our data are low frequency words in distinction to Ruppenhofer et al. (2017),
whose main data set looked at higher-frequency core vocabulary.

In another line of research, several studies have tackled the problem of classifying senses as either
objective or subjective. For English Su and Markert (2009) and Gyamﬁ et al. (2009) tackled this task
on data from WordNet. Subjective entries are ones that possess polarity, that is, they could in further
analysis be classiﬁed as either positive or negative. This task is similar to ours in the sense that a simple
binary categorization of items is sought. However, there are key differences. First, our classiﬁcation
targets lemmas not word senses. That is, we assume that the complex lemmas are monosemous or have
a clearly dominant sense in our data.4 Second, the distinction objective versus subjective does not fully
line up with the distinction non-afﬁxoid use versus afﬁxoid use. A complex form may contain the afﬁxoid
candidate in its regular objective sense but the other component may make the whole word subjective.
An example of this kind is Lieblings|hai ‘favorite shark’. Finally, since our complex forms are unlikely
to be listed in lexical resources, we will usually lack information such as glosses, supersenses or example
sentences for them.

4This assumption can be made plausible by the observations that longer words have more speciﬁc meanings than shorter
ones, and that they tend to have fewer meanings than their head words, and fewer meanings than their components do on
average (Altmann, 2002).

In another strand of research involving German morphology and sentiment analysis, Wiegand et al.
(2016) developed an approach to classify the ﬁrst element of German compounds as expressing either
the source or target of evaluation, or neither, relative to the second element, if in the ﬁrst step of analysis
the second element was determined to be subjective. As do we, those authors focused on noun-noun
compounds and they did not address polarity classiﬁcation. However, their approach targets higher
frequency words as it relies on the availability of sufﬁcient corpus data to enable the use of distributional
similarity. For our dataset, we cannot directly model the distributional properties of our complex items.

3 Data

Data creation. German has both nominal afﬁxoids – items that are related to nouns (e.g. Affen|tempo,
‘high speed’ [lit. ‘ape speed’]) – and adjectival afﬁxoids – items that are related to adjectives (e.g. un-
heils|schwanger ‘ominous’ [lit. ‘pregnant with doom’]).5 Here, we concentrate on nominal afﬁxoids.
Two subtypes of nominal afﬁxoids exist, depending on the position of the nominal afﬁxoid in the com-
plex word. Affe, as in Affentempo, is a preﬁxoid as it occurs as the ﬁrst item in the compound-like
complex word, whereas Gott is a sufﬁxoid as it occurs as the second item in complex formations such as
Gitarrengott ‘guitar god’. To make the best use of our resources for annotation, we focus on sufﬁxoids
here as we believe that addressing sufﬁxoids and preﬁxoids at the same time may not be helpful. Con-
sider that for many sufﬁxoid candidates, a sufﬁxoid use is recognizable by the fact that the referent of the
whole word is not a hyponym of the sufﬁxoid in its basic meaning. For instance, a Kredithai ‘loan shark’
is not a shark. With preﬁxoids, this is usually different, as they tend to add evaluation or intensiﬁcation
but do not change the class of referent. A Scheißauto ‘shit car’ is still a car.

No pre-compiled resource is available that lists all sufﬁxoids and the complex words in which they
ﬁgure. We therefore ﬁrst compiled a set of 60 possible sufﬁxoids from the literature on morphology
(Motsch, 2004; Erben, 2006; Elsen, 2009; Elsen, 2011; Fleischer et al., 2012) and then looked for
complex forms containing them in the 1.7-billion deWaC web corpus (Baroni et al., 2009).6 We queried
the corpus for complex forms whose lemma ended in one of the sufﬁxoids and where the sufﬁxoid was
preceded by at least four letters. The latter condition was imposed to rule out complex forms where the
ﬁrst part is a simple preﬁx. Further, we allowed only for complex forms spelled as contiguous strings as
standard German orthography does not allow open compounds. E.g. the German word for hammerhead
shark cannot be spelled as Hammer Hai using two white space-separated tokens.

The extracted forms were then semi-manually ﬁltered for remaining errors. We used the SMOR mor-
phological segmentation tool (Schmid et al., 2004; Faaß et al., 2010) to detect cases that did not represent
simple noun-noun combinations. We excluded instances that were not compliant with standard German
orthography, for instance, due to spelling errors or incorrect tokenization. We eliminated duplicates that
differed only in whether the two parts of the complex form were written contiguously or separated by a
hyphen. Thus, we for instance kept Hammerhai but not Hammer-Hai ‘hammerhead shark’.

To keep the overall effort manageable, we selected seven items from our pool of sufﬁxoids for anno-
tation and subsequent use in our experiments. We chose these for two reasons. First, we did not want
items that were extremely biased towards either afﬁxoid or non-afﬁxoid uses. For instance, more than
99% of the formations for Dreck ‘dirt’ and Junkie ‘junkie, addict’ are sufﬁxoid formations. Second, we
wanted items for which a sizable number of complex forms exist in our corpus. This criterion ruled out,
for instance, Base ‘female cousin’ because most forms found in the corpus were false positives involving
compounds using the homographic English noun base as a head, rather than intended German forms
such as Klatschbase ‘telltale/chatterbox’. Table 1 gives some basic descriptive information about the
items. The complex forms of these 7 items will represent the raw data for our gold standard (see also
supplementary material). In total, there are 1788 of such complex forms.

5Our literature survey did not throw up any German verbal afﬁxoids. This is not unexpected since German also has very
limited compounding involving verbs. They can only occur as modiﬁers in compounds with nominal or adjectival heads as in
Bratpfanne ‘frying pan’ or waschecht ‘colorfast’ [lit. ’wash-true’] (Olsen, 2000).

6We also found 40 possible nominal preﬁxoids in the literature we reviewed. Note that these lists are not necessarily
complete: the items discussed in the linguistic literature are discovered through introspection rather than in a data-driven way.

Table 3: Coverage by lexical resources (absolute and %)

Table 3 shows that only 429 items (24.0%) of the 1788 forms in the gold standard are covered by the
dlexdb lexical database (Heister et al., 2011), 54 (3.0%) are covered by GermaNet 11.0, and only 28
(1.6%) by Wiktionary. SentiMerge (Emerson and Declerck, 2014), the largest German sentiment lexicon
with close to 100k entries, covers 27 (1.5%) forms. By contrast, 93% of the 9300 items in Ruppenhofer
et al. (2017)’s main data set were covered by dlexdb, and 88.4% by GermaNet. Finally, Table 3 shows
that of the formations included in the various resources, the majority are non-afﬁxoid cases. Inclusion in
a resource thus is not a very useful feature as it is only predictive of the majority class.

Figure 1 illustrates that the token frequencies for the complex forms with K¨onig ‘king’ as its second
component have a largely Zipﬁan distribution: there are many complex forms with very low token fre-
quencies (in fact, mostly their frequency is 1), whereas there are very few complex forms with high token
frequencies. While we cannot show it here for lack of space, the shape of the distribution is the same for
all the sufﬁxoid candidates. Note further that the numbers shown in Table 2 do not delimit the produc-
tivity of these sufﬁxoids. Consider that, for instance, in a collection of 120 million tweets, we found 905
complex forms for K¨onig, of which only 226 overlapped with the 713 forms found in the deWaC corpus.
Annotation of the afﬁxoid vs. non-afﬁxoid distinction. Most of the data was annotated by one of the
authors. To assess how well human annotators agree on the distinction between afﬁxoid uses and non-
afﬁxoid uses, two of the authors performed an annotation experiment on 200 randomly chosen instances
of the total set of 1788 complex forms. The annotators could label each complex form as Y (only afﬁxoid
uses or predominantly afﬁxoid uses), N (only non-afﬁxoid uses or predominantly non-afﬁxoid uses) and

B (both types of use likely). The annotators achieved a Cohen’s kappa (Cohen, 1960) value of 0.67,
which amounts to substantial agreement according to Landis and Koch (1977). As the confusion matrix
in Figure 2 shows, the majority of errors are ‘milder’ cases where one annotator considers one type of
use dominant whereas the other considers both types of uses plausible.

4 Features

4.1 Automatic features

We ﬁrst explore features that can be extracted automatically from corpora and resources, which is the
most realistic setting. (We discuss our handling of missing values in §4.2).

Sufﬁxoid. Since the sufﬁxoid candidates differ in how frequently they do in fact occur as afﬁxoids and
also differ in their evaluative meanings, it makes sense to capture which sufﬁxoid in particular occurs in
a complex form. We deﬁne a binary indicator variable for each sufﬁxoid.

Frequency. There exists a signiﬁcant body of research in quantitative linguistics on the productivity
of morphological processes. But works on the productivity of compounding such as Altmann (2002)
or Krott et al. (1999) do not make a distinction between afﬁxoid formations and true compounds and
therefore there are no prior results on their similarities and differences in regards to productivity: the
assumption of increased productivity for afﬁxoids has, to our knowledge, not been empirically validated.
For our set sufﬁxoids, we used Baayen’s languageR R-package to compare, the lexical richness of
compound formations to that of afﬁxoid formations, per afﬁxoid candidate and for pooled data. We
found no consistent differences in terms of vocabulary growth curves, vocabulary growth rates or type-
token ratios (Baayen, 2005). This result notwithstanding, we want to see if frequency information about
the components and the complex forms could help us distinguish between the two kinds of complex
forms. One relevant intuition that we had in this regard is that the complex forms of afﬁxoidal uses may
tend to have lower frequencies than complex forms representing regular compounds. Table 4 shows that
for most items this seems to be borne out, although the difference is not statistically signiﬁcant, with the
exception of -hai. However, for -k¨onig the reverse situation holds in a statistically signiﬁcant way: the
frequencies of afﬁxoid formations are higher than those of the non-afﬁxoid formations.

Compositionality. This feature measures the compositionality of the complex word. The intuition
is as follows. In regular compounds, the meaning of the complex form is more or less compositionally

derived from the meaning of the components. However, since afﬁxoid uses of the morphemes in question
go along with bleached meanings, the semantics of a complex word containing an afﬁxoid use should
be harder to model compositionally. Following Schulte im Walde et al. (2013), we represent each com-
ponent as well as the complex word as vectors. As our measure of compositionality, we determine the
cosine similarity between the sum of the component vectors and the vector of the complex word.

We used fastText (Bojanowski et al., 2016) in its default setting to train word embeddings on the
SdeWaC-corpus (Faaß and Eckart, 2013), which contains about 880 million tokens and is a cleaned up
version of the deWaC corpus (Baroni et al., 2009). The choice of fastText was motivated by the fact that
fastText computes vectors for words by adding up the vectors for n-grams found in the words, which
allows us to produce vectors for words not seen in the training data. Since many of our complex forms
are (near-)hapaxes, this is a crucial beneﬁt of fastText.

Pointwise mutual information. We use Pointwise mutual information (Church and Hanks, 1990) to
capture the level of association between the two components of the complex word. The expectation is
that the components of regular compounds exhibit higher PMI-scores than the components of a complex
word involving an afﬁxoid. This is motivated by Tellenbach (1985)’s observation that for complex forms
containing an afﬁxoid use, paraphrases containing the morpheme in question as a free word are unlikely.
By contrast, compositional compounds are often paraphrased using their components. As an example, the
compositional compound Perserk¨onig is readily paraphrased as K¨onig der Perser ‘king of the Persians’,
whereas Gitarrenk¨onig is less likely to be paraphrased as K¨onig der Gitarre ‘king of the guitar’. Even
aside from paraphrasing, it seems more likely that Perser and K¨onig occur together in a text as they share
the context of governance than it does that Gitarre and K¨onig co-occur.

GermaNet supersenses. As in the English WordNet (Miller, 1995), GermaNet’s synsets are associ-
ated with supersenses that deﬁne high-level categorizations such as Human, Animal, Artifact, or
Group. A lexical unit in GermaNet can be associated with one or more of its supersenses. Accordingly,
we deﬁne three series of indicator variables that capture whether any sense of the complex form, the ﬁrst
component or the second component exhibits a particular supersense. We refer to all these features as
supersenses bag. This feature group is motivated by the observation that with several of our sufﬁxoid
candidates, the semantic types of the ﬁrst component and the complex form tends to provide good evi-
dence on whether the complex word will be an afﬁxoidal use or not. For instance, the ﬁrst component
Haﬂinger in Haﬂinger|hengst refers to a breed of horses and the complex form is a regular compound.
By contrast, the ﬁrst component B¨uro ‘ofﬁce’ of B¨uro|hengst refers to either an Artifact or a Group
and the complex form represents an afﬁxoidal use meaning something like ‘pencil pusher’. Moreover,
the complex form Haﬂingerhengst also has the supersense Animal, whereas B¨urohengst has the su-
persense Human. Because for this particular set of sufﬁxoid candidates differences between the second
component and the complex word’s supersenses may be particularly important, we experiment with an
alternative set of supersense features (supersenses diffs): we use a series of indicator variables that code
whether the second component and the complex word differ in their value for a given supersense.7

Polarity. Since afﬁxoid uses are likely to have evaluative meanings, we explore whether this is re-
ﬂected in the polarity of the two components and the complex form. We extract polarity information for
all three from SentiMerge (Emerson and Declerck, 2014). With 96,918 entries, it is to date the largest
available polarity lexicon for German. SentiMerge was created by harmonizing and combining three
smaller lexicons (PolArt (Klenner et al., 2009); GermanPolarityClues (Waltinger, 2010); and SentiWS
(Remus et al., 2010)) using a Bayesian probabilistic model.

Psycholinguistic features. If available, we extract psycholinguistic ratings along four dimensions
for the whole word and its components. This type of feature has been successfully used in various
tasks, such as identifying metaphors (Turney et al., 2011; Klebanov et al., 2014); studying persuasion
(Tan et al., 2016); sarcasm detection (Bamman and Smith, 2015); and, most similar to us, polarity
prediction for complex words (Ruppenhofer et al., 2017). The ﬁrst dimension places words on a scale
from abstract to concrete (abstconc). Abstract words refer to things that we cannot perceive directly with

7Note that for other sufﬁxoids not covered here such as Papst (lit. ‘pope’, sufﬁxoid ‘expert’) and Nest (lit. ‘nest’, afﬁxoid

‘den/hideout’) there is no difference at all between the supersenses of the second component and the complex word.

our senses (integer, politics, . . . ) whereas concrete words refer to things we can perceive (sound, scent,
. . . ). The second dimension concerns imageability (img). A large subset of concrete words have a high
imageability. These words refer to things that we can actually see (chestnut, police jeep, . . . ). The third
rating dimension is valence (val), which measures the pleasantness of a word (gift vs. punishment). The
ﬁnal dimension, arousal, represents the intensity of emotion caused by a stimulus (alert vs. calm).8 We
obtain affective ratings from the resource of K¨oper and Schulte im Walde (2016). It provides information
on 350k words and is far more comprehensive than the affective norm data of Kanske and Kotz (2010)
or Lahl et al. (2009). It is also much larger than commonly used polarity lexicons for German such as
PolArt (Klenner et al., 2009) or GermanPolarityClues (Waltinger, 2010).

Emotion. Since emotion information is commonly used in sentiment-related classiﬁcation tasks (e.g.
Tang et al. (2014), Sulis et al. (2016)), we wanted to see to what extent emotion information could beneﬁt
our task. For this purpose, we use the NRC Word-Emotion Association Lexicon (EmoLex) for English
which was created by Mohammad and Turner (2013) using a crowdsourcing approach. EmoLex contains
binary associations of words with the eight basic emotions (joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, surprise,
trust, anticipation) of Plutchik (1962) . Although the German version of the lexicon was produced using
machine translation, we use it here because we do not have a similarly large natively produced resource
available for German. The German EmoLex covers 9630 lemmas. For each complex form, we extract
the emotions associated with the overall word and do likewise for the ﬁrst and the second components.

4.2 Missing value imputation

With features derived from resources (polarity, psycholinguistic ratings, emotion, supersenses and PMI),
we face the problem that there are gaps in coverage. Various strategies are conceivable to ﬁll in missing
values. The ﬁrst one we considered is to substitute for a word that is not covered that word which is
most similar to it according to cosine similarity among the fastText vectors and which is covered by the
resource. A second approach we considered is to use the mean value for the feature in question. A third
approach uses the median. A fourth option is to use the modal value. Our experiments showed that for our
SVM classiﬁer, the choice of imputation strategy does not result in any statistically signiﬁcant differences
in results. We thus report results based on the ﬁrst strategy, which is based on cosine similarity.

4.3 Manual feature annotations

In order to be able to explore to what extent the notions of intensiﬁcation and evaluation correlate with
the use of our target morphemes as either afﬁxoids or regular morphemes, we added further annotations
to our complex forms. We labeled them manually with respect to the features listed below. Based on the
theoretical literature, they should be very predictive for our afﬁxoid classiﬁcation task.9

• Polarity of complex word: does the item have positive, negative or neutral polarity?

the complex word express high intensity?

• Evaluativity of complex word: does the complex word mostly carry either a positive or negative

evaluation? B¨urohengst ‘pencil pusher’: yes; Haﬂingerhengst ‘Haﬂinger stallion’: no.

• Head Intensity: does the head (i.e. the potential afﬁxoid) contribute an intensifying meaning to the

overall word? Charmebolzen ‘highly charming person’: yes; Riesenbolzen ‘giant bolt’: no.

• Head Polarity: does the head of the complex word contribute an evaluating meaning to the overall

word? Fußballgott ‘footballing god’: yes; Wettergott ‘weather god’: no.

5 Experiments

5.1 Automatically extracted features

Our experimental set-up is as follows. We perform a 5-fold cross validation. Our data is initially ran-
domized before we deﬁned folds that are held constant across all experiments. For our experiments,

8Valence and arousal are part of (Osgood et al., 1957)’s well-known theory of emotions.
9We tested agreement only for polarity of the complex word. Here, two annotators achieved a kappa of 0.86 on a random

sample of 200 items.

we convert the instances of B(oth) to instances of Y, i.e. afﬁxoid uses. The seven instances that the
annotators had left as unsure are excluded from the experiments. We use the automatically extractable
features discussed in §4.1. As our classiﬁer, we use SVM (Vapnik, 1995), as implemented by SVMlight
(Joachims, 1998). Note that we experimented with the cost-factor, by which training errors on positive
examples (i.e. examples of class Y) outweight errors on negative examples (i.e. examples of class N).
However, modifying it only helped in the lowest-performing conﬁgurations where we would otherwise
perform exactly like the majority baseline. Table 5 reports results for the different features obtained
with the default settings of SVMlight. The majority baseline we report represents a classiﬁer that always
predicts non-afﬁxoid as this is the majority class for each sufﬁxoid and the dataset as a whole.

Table 5: Results for classiﬁcation experiments per feature group; setting: 5-fold CV
The bag of supersenses is the best feature group and notably better than paying attention only to

differences between second component and complex word in terms of supersenses.

5.2 Automatic features in balanced setting

The difference in performance between the two classes that we found when using all data (cf. §5.1)
might be due either to the class imbalance or come about because the majority class N is inherently
easier to learn. In order to tease this apart, we here repeat the previous experiment using all features in
a 5-fold cross-validation setting, however this time with a balanced dataset of 970 items. The dataset
is constructed so that each fold contains the same number of instances per sufﬁxoid and those instances
are themselves balanced equally across the afﬁxoid and non-afﬁxoid classes.10 As Table 6 shows, with
balanced data we can obtain much more balanced performance on the two classes. And despite the fact
that we are using only 54.3% of the available data, the overall F1-score (0.73) is more or less tied with
the result obtained on all data (0.74).

5.3 Feature ablation experiments

Table 7 shows an ablation experiment using all data. We remove one particular feature from the entire
feature set at a time. The table shows that the performance decreases only marginally for most removed
features, which indicates that most features encode information. The largest performance drop is caused
by removing supersenses, which suggests that this is the feature with the most unique information.

Since the supersense feature is both the strongest individual feature (cf. Table 5) and also the feature
encoding most unique information (cf. Table 7), we further examined this feature by listing the top 10
supersenses according to χ2 ranking as shown in Table 8. The most predictive supersenses are predom-
inantly those of the ﬁrst component of the compound or those of the (complex) compound form itself.
This ﬁrst component is very helpful, for instance, for K¨onig. Its non-afﬁxoid uses (e.g. Sarazenenk¨onig
’king of the Saracens’) mostly co-occur with a ﬁrst component denoting a Location or a nationality

10These latter two constraints result in only 970 items being used rather than 984, if we simply used all 492 instances of class

Y and added as many instances from class N.

Table 7: Ablation experiments where one feature is removed from the entire feature set

(Human) whereas its afﬁxoid uses typically involve Events (e.g. Tanzk¨onig ‘dancing king’) or artifacts
or objects (e.g. Schotterk¨onig ‘king of gravel’). The importance of the supersense of the whole word
arises in relation to the supersense of the second component. When the two differ for some of the af-
ﬁxoid candidates, the meaning of the whole word is usually only metaphorically related to the second
component. For instance, while Hai ‘shark’ and Hengst ‘stallion’ refer to Animals in their basic mean-
ing, complex forms in which they occur as afﬁxoids refer to Humans. Similarly, Bolzen refers to an
Artifact but complex forms containing an afﬁxoid use of it refer to Humans.

5.4 Cross-afﬁxoid generalization

Using the automatic features, we experiment with a setting where we train on the instances of all but one
afﬁxoid candidate and then test on the instances of the reamining afﬁxoid. For this experiment, we leave
out the lexical sufﬁxoid feature. Table 9 shows the results.

Table 9: Results for cross-afﬁxoid classiﬁcation, training on six afﬁxoids, testing on the remaining one;
all features except sufﬁxoid

The results show lower performance than in the cross-validation setting where we had instances of all
afﬁxoids in the train and the test folds. For k¨onig the results drop down as low as the majority baseline
in the present setting. However, the low result is very likely also heavily driven by the fact that the
instances of k¨onig make up close to 40% of our whole dataset. In other words, when testing on k¨onig,
we use only 60% of the dataset to train on. On the other hand, we also see lower results on afﬁxoids
such as bolzen that are much less frequent than k¨onig and for which we use more training instances in
the present generalization setting than we did in the cross-validation setting in §5.1. This suggests that
overall cross-afﬁxoid generalization may be somewhat limited.

5.5 Gold-quality manual features

The ﬁnal experiment we perform is a simple one: we use the manual features described in §4.3 and try
to predict whether the complex form is an afﬁxoid formation or not.
Table 10 shows that all features are highly predictive, with intensifying function of the sufﬁxoid being
the best. The results conﬁrm that afﬁxoids can be deﬁned in terms of intensiﬁcation and evaluation.

6 Error analysis

Table 11 shows confusion matrices per sufﬁxoid candidate and for all data cumulatively for the best
setting in our automatic experiments (cf. Table 5), in which all features were used in 5-fold cross valida-
tion. The breakdown per sufﬁxoid candidate reveals that the overall performance is strongly inﬂuenced
by K¨onig, which in particular contributes the bulk of the recall of true afﬁxoid formations.

Table 12 below shows the confusion matrix for the experiment with a balanced data set reported in
§5.2. As was to be expected based on the scores in Table 6, the performance across the different sufﬁxoids
is now much better. We can thus conclude that the difference in performance between the two classes
that we found when using all data is largely owed to the class imbalance and that the distinction between
afﬁxoid formations and non-afﬁxoid formations can in principle be learned for sufﬁxoids other than
K¨onig.

7 Conclusion

In this paper we studied German complex forms containing sufﬁxoid candidates. To do so, we con-
structed a new data set with 1788 items distributed about 7 potential afﬁxoid candidates, which we
make available to the research community. In one set of experiments we validated the high correlation
between evaluative and intensifying semantics and afﬁxoid status that has always been assumed by theo-
retical work but not demonstrated. In another experiment, we tackled the task of classifying our complex
forms as afﬁxoids formations or regular compounds. Being able to do so successfully can be useful
for sentiment analysis, as the afﬁxoid uses are typically evaluative. The task is difﬁcult, though, as we
have little reliable information about the complex forms available due to their low frequency. Still, we
achieved best results of 74% F1-score using a custom set of features, among which supersenses had the
most impact.

In future work, we plan on pursuing lines of research that we needed to leave open here. First, we
would like to cover more sufﬁxoid candidates and also extend this work to preﬁxoid formations. Second,
we want to tackle afﬁxoids that occur in complex adjectival forms. Finally, once we have annotated data
for further afﬁxoid candidates in hand, we would like to explore if it is possible to identify morphemes
that have afﬁxoid uses from properties of their formations, including their frequency distribution, and
distinguish them from morphemes that only participate in regular compounds. Since so far afﬁxoids
have been identiﬁed based on human introspection, we do not know how many of them actually exist in
German or other languages.

Michael Wiegand and Rebecca Wilm were partially supported by the German Research Foundation
(DFG) under grants WI 4204/2-1 and RU 1873/2-1. We would also like to thank Ulrich Heid for the
inspiration to study afﬁxoids.

Abstract

We study German afﬁxoids, a type of morpheme in between afﬁxes and free stems. Several prop-
erties have been associated with them – increased productivity; a bleached semantics, which is
often evaluative and/or intensifying and thus of relevance to sentiment analysis; and the existence
of a free morpheme counterpart – but not been validated empirically. In experiments on a new
data set that we make available, we put these key assumptions from the morphological literature
to the test and show that despite the fact that afﬁxoids generate many low-frequency formations,
we can classify these as afﬁxoid or non-afﬁxoid instances with a best F1-score of 74%.

Introduction

In this work, we study a subset of complex German words that includes many hapaxes, namely items that
have as one of their morphological components a so-called afﬁxoid or semi-afﬁx. Examples of afﬁxoid
formations include Gesetzeshengst ‘jobsworth, stickler for the letter of the law’ [lit. ‘law/legal stallion’]
or Mentalit¨atsmonster ‘person with laser focus’ [lit. ‘mentality monster’]. The class of afﬁxoid mor-
phemes sits in between afﬁxes and stems. While various criteria have been proposed to identify afﬁxoids
(Schmidt, 1987), at least the following three are widely taken for granted (ten Hacken, 2000; Elsen,
2009): (i) increased productivity; (ii) semantic bleaching/decreased semantic speciﬁcity; and (iii) an et-
ymological and formal link to an existing free stem. The ﬁrst two criteria are applied by comparing the
afﬁxoid to its corresponding free stem. For instance, in Weingott ‘deity of wine’, Gott is a free morpheme
occurring with its regular meaning; in Gitarrengott ‘guitar god’, Gott is an afﬁxoid: the whole word does
not refer to a deity but to a talented human guitar player. Such evaluative or intensifying meanings are a
hallmark of afﬁxoids (Meibauer, 2013). The last of the three criteria distinguishes afﬁxoids from afﬁxes,
which by deﬁnition occur only bound to other morphemes. For example, German -heit, whose English
cognate is -hood as in falsehood, is an afﬁx: there is no longer a related free form. By contrast, German
-gott is an afﬁxoid since there is a related free form Gott, cognate with English god.

Research on afﬁxoids has been centered on Germanic languages like German, Dutch and Swedish
(Ascoop and Leuschner, 2006; Booij, 2005; Booij and H¨uning, 2014; Norde and Van Goethem, 2014).
However, we believe afﬁxoids are not an exclusive feature of these languages. They are likely to arise in
other languages with productive compounding. For English, for instance, there is little to no systematic
research but arguably quality (as in quality press/furniture/diamonds but not in quality management) and
nut (as in health/math/trivia nut but not in pecan nut) can be considered English afﬁxoids. Even for
languages on which there is more research, that work is typically focused on the theoretical relevance
of assuming a category of afﬁxoids that is distinct from afﬁxes on the one hand and compounds on the
other. Very little quantitative work using corpus data has been done to, for instance, study the level of
productivity for different afﬁxoid candidates or to substantiate the intuition that most afﬁxoid uses carry
evaluative meanings. Our work thus ﬁlls an empirical gap in the theoretical discussion.

In addition, we are interested in studying afﬁxoids for the purposes of sentiment analysis. On the
one hand, theoretical linguistic work that notes the expressive function of afﬁxoids such as Meibauer

(2013) suggests this. On the other hand, it is known from prior research on sentiment analysis that hapax
words in general are often subjective (Wiebe et al., 2004). As we show in §3, afﬁxoids tend to generate
many (near-)hapax forms, which meshes with observations on their productivity in the morphological
literature and the general expectation about the Zipﬁan distribution of word frequencies. Since hapaxes,
by deﬁnition, cannot be readily analyzed based on their distribution in corpora, it would be very useful
if we could make use of their intrinsic properties to classify such forms as afﬁxoid uses (and therefore
likely subjective) or not.

The main task that we set ourselves in this paper is morpheme sense disambiguation: we want to
classify complex forms containing possible afﬁxoids as to whether the morphemes in question really
occur as afﬁxoids with special meanings or as regular morphemes with their full, common semantics.
We frame this task as a binary classiﬁcation problem. The major contributions of our paper are:

• a gold standard annotation of complex forms containing potential afﬁxoids, which make publicly

• empirical validation of claims regarding the association between intensiﬁcation / evaluation and

• a detailed examination of various novel features that have been devised to detect the presence of an

2 Related work

Recently, Ruppenhofer et al. (2017) studied the problem of how well the polarity of complex words,
including both compounds and derived forms, can be predicted based on its components and the word’s
morphological structure. They found that, while on core vocabulary – deﬁned as items listed in the PolArt
dictionary (Klenner et al., 2009) and highly likely to be listed in GermaNet (Hamp and Feldweg, 1997),
the German WordNet resource – classiﬁcation accuracy was as high as 85%, performance was severely
degraded on more colloquial, domain-speciﬁc and linguistically creative forms taken from Wiktionary2
and the Wortwarte3 neologism project. Note that this research did not distinguish true compounds from
complex forms involving afﬁxoids.

Similar research was carried out earlier by Moilanen and Pulman (2008) who evaluated how well it was
possible to classify unknown English words into one of three polarity classes based on morphological
analysis. Compared to these prior efforts, our task is narrower as we do not deal with derivation and do
not predict polarity for the complex entries. Our data is also more focused since we have only complex
forms containing exactly two nouns and the second components of our data represent only 7 different
lemmas. And importantly, our data are low frequency words in distinction to Ruppenhofer et al. (2017),
whose main data set looked at higher-frequency core vocabulary.

In another line of research, several studies have tackled the problem of classifying senses as either
objective or subjective. For English Su and Markert (2009) and Gyamﬁ et al. (2009) tackled this task
on data from WordNet. Subjective entries are ones that possess polarity, that is, they could in further
analysis be classiﬁed as either positive or negative. This task is similar to ours in the sense that a simple
binary categorization of items is sought. However, there are key differences. First, our classiﬁcation
targets lemmas not word senses. That is, we assume that the complex lemmas are monosemous or have
a clearly dominant sense in our data.4 Second, the distinction objective versus subjective does not fully
line up with the distinction non-afﬁxoid use versus afﬁxoid use. A complex form may contain the afﬁxoid
candidate in its regular objective sense but the other component may make the whole word subjective.
An example of this kind is Lieblings|hai ‘favorite shark’. Finally, since our complex forms are unlikely
to be listed in lexical resources, we will usually lack information such as glosses, supersenses or example
sentences for them.

4This assumption can be made plausible by the observations that longer words have more speciﬁc meanings than shorter
ones, and that they tend to have fewer meanings than their head words, and fewer meanings than their components do on
average (Altmann, 2002).

In another strand of research involving German morphology and sentiment analysis, Wiegand et al.
(2016) developed an approach to classify the ﬁrst element of German compounds as expressing either
the source or target of evaluation, or neither, relative to the second element, if in the ﬁrst step of analysis
the second element was determined to be subjective. As do we, those authors focused on noun-noun
compounds and they did not address polarity classiﬁcation. However, their approach targets higher
frequency words as it relies on the availability of sufﬁcient corpus data to enable the use of distributional
similarity. For our dataset, we cannot directly model the distributional properties of our complex items.

3 Data

Data creation. German has both nominal afﬁxoids – items that are related to nouns (e.g. Affen|tempo,
‘high speed’ [lit. ‘ape speed’]) – and adjectival afﬁxoids – items that are related to adjectives (e.g. un-
heils|schwanger ‘ominous’ [lit. ‘pregnant with doom’]).5 Here, we concentrate on nominal afﬁxoids.
Two subtypes of nominal afﬁxoids exist, depending on the position of the nominal afﬁxoid in the com-
plex word. Affe, as in Affentempo, is a preﬁxoid as it occurs as the ﬁrst item in the compound-like
complex word, whereas Gott is a sufﬁxoid as it occurs as the second item in complex formations such as
Gitarrengott ‘guitar god’. To make the best use of our resources for annotation, we focus on sufﬁxoids
here as we believe that addressing sufﬁxoids and preﬁxoids at the same time may not be helpful. Con-
sider that for many sufﬁxoid candidates, a sufﬁxoid use is recognizable by the fact that the referent of the
whole word is not a hyponym of the sufﬁxoid in its basic meaning. For instance, a Kredithai ‘loan shark’
is not a shark. With preﬁxoids, this is usually different, as they tend to add evaluation or intensiﬁcation
but do not change the class of referent. A Scheißauto ‘shit car’ is still a car.

No pre-compiled resource is available that lists all sufﬁxoids and the complex words in which they
ﬁgure. We therefore ﬁrst compiled a set of 60 possible sufﬁxoids from the literature on morphology
(Motsch, 2004; Erben, 2006; Elsen, 2009; Elsen, 2011; Fleischer et al., 2012) and then looked for
complex forms containing them in the 1.7-billion deWaC web corpus (Baroni et al., 2009).6 We queried
the corpus for complex forms whose lemma ended in one of the sufﬁxoids and where the sufﬁxoid was
preceded by at least four letters. The latter condition was imposed to rule out complex forms where the
ﬁrst part is a simple preﬁx. Further, we allowed only for complex forms spelled as contiguous strings as
standard German orthography does not allow open compounds. E.g. the German word for hammerhead
shark cannot be spelled as Hammer Hai using two white space-separated tokens.

The extracted forms were then semi-manually ﬁltered for remaining errors. We used the SMOR mor-
phological segmentation tool (Schmid et al., 2004; Faaß et al., 2010) to detect cases that did not represent
simple noun-noun combinations. We excluded instances that were not compliant with standard German
orthography, for instance, due to spelling errors or incorrect tokenization. We eliminated duplicates that
differed only in whether the two parts of the complex form were written contiguously or separated by a
hyphen. Thus, we for instance kept Hammerhai but not Hammer-Hai ‘hammerhead shark’.

To keep the overall effort manageable, we selected seven items from our pool of sufﬁxoids for anno-
tation and subsequent use in our experiments. We chose these for two reasons. First, we did not want
items that were extremely biased towards either afﬁxoid or non-afﬁxoid uses. For instance, more than
99% of the formations for Dreck ‘dirt’ and Junkie ‘junkie, addict’ are sufﬁxoid formations. Second, we
wanted items for which a sizable number of complex forms exist in our corpus. This criterion ruled out,
for instance, Base ‘female cousin’ because most forms found in the corpus were false positives involving
compounds using the homographic English noun base as a head, rather than intended German forms
such as Klatschbase ‘telltale/chatterbox’. Table 1 gives some basic descriptive information about the
items. The complex forms of these 7 items will represent the raw data for our gold standard (see also
supplementary material). In total, there are 1788 of such complex forms.

5Our literature survey did not throw up any German verbal afﬁxoids. This is not unexpected since German also has very
limited compounding involving verbs. They can only occur as modiﬁers in compounds with nominal or adjectival heads as in
Bratpfanne ‘frying pan’ or waschecht ‘colorfast’ [lit. ’wash-true’] (Olsen, 2000).

6We also found 40 possible nominal preﬁxoids in the literature we reviewed. Note that these lists are not necessarily
complete: the items discussed in the linguistic literature are discovered through introspection rather than in a data-driven way.

Table 3: Coverage by lexical resources (absolute and %)

Table 3 shows that only 429 items (24.0%) of the 1788 forms in the gold standard are covered by the
dlexdb lexical database (Heister et al., 2011), 54 (3.0%) are covered by GermaNet 11.0, and only 28
(1.6%) by Wiktionary. SentiMerge (Emerson and Declerck, 2014), the largest German sentiment lexicon
with close to 100k entries, covers 27 (1.5%) forms. By contrast, 93% of the 9300 items in Ruppenhofer
et al. (2017)’s main data set were covered by dlexdb, and 88.4% by GermaNet. Finally, Table 3 shows
that of the formations included in the various resources, the majority are non-afﬁxoid cases. Inclusion in
a resource thus is not a very useful feature as it is only predictive of the majority class.

Figure 1 illustrates that the token frequencies for the complex forms with K¨onig ‘king’ as its second
component have a largely Zipﬁan distribution: there are many complex forms with very low token fre-
quencies (in fact, mostly their frequency is 1), whereas there are very few complex forms with high token
frequencies. While we cannot show it here for lack of space, the shape of the distribution is the same for
all the sufﬁxoid candidates. Note further that the numbers shown in Table 2 do not delimit the produc-
tivity of these sufﬁxoids. Consider that, for instance, in a collection of 120 million tweets, we found 905
complex forms for K¨onig, of which only 226 overlapped with the 713 forms found in the deWaC corpus.
Annotation of the afﬁxoid vs. non-afﬁxoid distinction. Most of the data was annotated by one of the
authors. To assess how well human annotators agree on the distinction between afﬁxoid uses and non-
afﬁxoid uses, two of the authors performed an annotation experiment on 200 randomly chosen instances
of the total set of 1788 complex forms. The annotators could label each complex form as Y (only afﬁxoid
uses or predominantly afﬁxoid uses), N (only non-afﬁxoid uses or predominantly non-afﬁxoid uses) and

which amounts to substantial agreement according to Landis and Koch (1977). As the confusion matrix
in Figure 2 shows, the majority of errors are ‘milder’ cases where one annotator considers one type of
use dominant whereas the other considers both types of uses plausible.

4 Features

4.1 Automatic features

We ﬁrst explore features that can be extracted automatically from corpora and resources, which is the
most realistic setting. (We discuss our handling of missing values in §4.2).

Sufﬁxoid. Since the sufﬁxoid candidates differ in how frequently they do in fact occur as afﬁxoids and
also differ in their evaluative meanings, it makes sense to capture which sufﬁxoid in particular occurs in
a complex form. We deﬁne a binary indicator variable for each sufﬁxoid.

Frequency. There exists a signiﬁcant body of research in quantitative linguistics on the productivity
of morphological processes. But works on the productivity of compounding such as Altmann (2002)
or Krott et al. (1999) do not make a distinction between afﬁxoid formations and true compounds and
therefore there are no prior results on their similarities and differences in regards to productivity: the
assumption of increased productivity for afﬁxoids has, to our knowledge, not been empirically validated.
For our set sufﬁxoids, we used Baayen’s languageR R-package to compare, the lexical richness of
compound formations to that of afﬁxoid formations, per afﬁxoid candidate and for pooled data. We
found no consistent differences in terms of vocabulary growth curves, vocabulary growth rates or type-
token ratios (Baayen, 2005). This result notwithstanding, we want to see if frequency information about
the components and the complex forms could help us distinguish between the two kinds of complex
forms. One relevant intuition that we had in this regard is that the complex forms of afﬁxoidal uses may
tend to have lower frequencies than complex forms representing regular compounds. Table 4 shows that
for most items this seems to be borne out, although the difference is not statistically signiﬁcant, with the
exception of -hai. However, for -k¨onig the reverse situation holds in a statistically signiﬁcant way: the
frequencies of afﬁxoid formations are higher than those of the non-afﬁxoid formations.

Compositionality. This feature measures the compositionality of the complex word. The intuition
is as follows. In regular compounds, the meaning of the complex form is more or less compositionally

derived from the meaning of the components. However, since afﬁxoid uses of the morphemes in question
go along with bleached meanings, the semantics of a complex word containing an afﬁxoid use should
be harder to model compositionally. Following Schulte im Walde et al. (2013), we represent each com-
ponent as well as the complex word as vectors. As our measure of compositionality, we determine the
cosine similarity between the sum of the component vectors and the vector of the complex word.

We used fastText (Bojanowski et al., 2016) in its default setting to train word embeddings on the
SdeWaC-corpus (Faaß and Eckart, 2013), which contains about 880 million tokens and is a cleaned up
version of the deWaC corpus (Baroni et al., 2009). The choice of fastText was motivated by the fact that
fastText computes vectors for words by adding up the vectors for n-grams found in the words, which
allows us to produce vectors for words not seen in the training data. Since many of our complex forms
are (near-)hapaxes, this is a crucial beneﬁt of fastText.

Pointwise mutual information. We use Pointwise mutual information (Church and Hanks, 1990) to
capture the level of association between the two components of the complex word. The expectation is
that the components of regular compounds exhibit higher PMI-scores than the components of a complex
word involving an afﬁxoid. This is motivated by Tellenbach (1985)’s observation that for complex forms
containing an afﬁxoid use, paraphrases containing the morpheme in question as a free word are unlikely.
By contrast, compositional compounds are often paraphrased using their components. As an example, the
compositional compound Perserk¨onig is readily paraphrased as K¨onig der Perser ‘king of the Persians’,
whereas Gitarrenk¨onig is less likely to be paraphrased as K¨onig der Gitarre ‘king of the guitar’. Even
aside from paraphrasing, it seems more likely that Perser and K¨onig occur together in a text as they share
the context of governance than it does that Gitarre and K¨onig co-occur.

GermaNet supersenses. As in the English WordNet (Miller, 1995), GermaNet’s synsets are associ-
ated with supersenses that deﬁne high-level categorizations such as Human, Animal, Artifact, or
Group. A lexical unit in GermaNet can be associated with one or more of its supersenses. Accordingly,
we deﬁne three series of indicator variables that capture whether any sense of the complex form, the ﬁrst
component or the second component exhibits a particular supersense. We refer to all these features as
supersenses bag. This feature group is motivated by the observation that with several of our sufﬁxoid
candidates, the semantic types of the ﬁrst component and the complex form tends to provide good evi-
dence on whether the complex word will be an afﬁxoidal use or not. For instance, the ﬁrst component
Haﬂinger in Haﬂinger|hengst refers to a breed of horses and the complex form is a regular compound.
By contrast, the ﬁrst component B¨uro ‘ofﬁce’ of B¨uro|hengst refers to either an Artifact or a Group
and the complex form represents an afﬁxoidal use meaning something like ‘pencil pusher’. Moreover,
the complex form Haﬂingerhengst also has the supersense Animal, whereas B¨urohengst has the su-
persense Human. Because for this particular set of sufﬁxoid candidates differences between the second
component and the complex word’s supersenses may be particularly important, we experiment with an
alternative set of supersense features (supersenses diffs): we use a series of indicator variables that code
whether the second component and the complex word differ in their value for a given supersense.7

Polarity. Since afﬁxoid uses are likely to have evaluative meanings, we explore whether this is re-
ﬂected in the polarity of the two components and the complex form. We extract polarity information for
all three from SentiMerge (Emerson and Declerck, 2014). With 96,918 entries, it is to date the largest
available polarity lexicon for German. SentiMerge was created by harmonizing and combining three
smaller lexicons (PolArt (Klenner et al., 2009); GermanPolarityClues (Waltinger, 2010); and SentiWS
(Remus et al., 2010)) using a Bayesian probabilistic model.

Psycholinguistic features. If available, we extract psycholinguistic ratings along four dimensions
for the whole word and its components. This type of feature has been successfully used in various
tasks, such as identifying metaphors (Turney et al., 2011; Klebanov et al., 2014); studying persuasion
(Tan et al., 2016); sarcasm detection (Bamman and Smith, 2015); and, most similar to us, polarity
prediction for complex words (Ruppenhofer et al., 2017). The ﬁrst dimension places words on a scale
from abstract to concrete (abstconc). Abstract words refer to things that we cannot perceive directly with

7Note that for other sufﬁxoids not covered here such as Papst (lit. ‘pope’, sufﬁxoid ‘expert’) and Nest (lit. ‘nest’, afﬁxoid

‘den/hideout’) there is no difference at all between the supersenses of the second component and the complex word.

our senses (integer, politics, . . . ) whereas concrete words refer to things we can perceive (sound, scent,
. . . ). The second dimension concerns imageability (img). A large subset of concrete words have a high
imageability. These words refer to things that we can actually see (chestnut, police jeep, . . . ). The third
rating dimension is valence (val), which measures the pleasantness of a word (gift vs. punishment). The
ﬁnal dimension, arousal, represents the intensity of emotion caused by a stimulus (alert vs. calm).8 We
obtain affective ratings from the resource of K¨oper and Schulte im Walde (2016). It provides information
on 350k words and is far more comprehensive than the affective norm data of Kanske and Kotz (2010)
or Lahl et al. (2009). It is also much larger than commonly used polarity lexicons for German such as
PolArt (Klenner et al., 2009) or GermanPolarityClues (Waltinger, 2010).

Emotion. Since emotion information is commonly used in sentiment-related classiﬁcation tasks (e.g.
Tang et al. (2014), Sulis et al. (2016)), we wanted to see to what extent emotion information could beneﬁt
our task. For this purpose, we use the NRC Word-Emotion Association Lexicon (EmoLex) for English
which was created by Mohammad and Turner (2013) using a crowdsourcing approach. EmoLex contains
binary associations of words with the eight basic emotions (joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, surprise,
trust, anticipation) of Plutchik (1962) . Although the German version of the lexicon was produced using
machine translation, we use it here because we do not have a similarly large natively produced resource
available for German. The German EmoLex covers 9630 lemmas. For each complex form, we extract
the emotions associated with the overall word and do likewise for the ﬁrst and the second components.

4.2 Missing value imputation

With features derived from resources (polarity, psycholinguistic ratings, emotion, supersenses and PMI),
we face the problem that there are gaps in coverage. Various strategies are conceivable to ﬁll in missing
values. The ﬁrst one we considered is to substitute for a word that is not covered that word which is
most similar to it according to cosine similarity among the fastText vectors and which is covered by the
resource. A second approach we considered is to use the mean value for the feature in question. A third
approach uses the median. A fourth option is to use the modal value. Our experiments showed that for our
SVM classiﬁer, the choice of imputation strategy does not result in any statistically signiﬁcant differences
in results. We thus report results based on the ﬁrst strategy, which is based on cosine similarity.

4.3 Manual feature annotations

In order to be able to explore to what extent the notions of intensiﬁcation and evaluation correlate with
the use of our target morphemes as either afﬁxoids or regular morphemes, we added further annotations
to our complex forms. We labeled them manually with respect to the features listed below. Based on the
theoretical literature, they should be very predictive for our afﬁxoid classiﬁcation task.9

• Polarity of complex word: does the item have positive, negative or neutral polarity?
• High intensity of complex word:

does
Temperamentsbolzen ‘highly temperamental person’: yes; Metallbolzen ‘metal bolt’: no.

the complex word express high intensity?

• Evaluativity of complex word: does the complex word mostly carry either a positive or negative

evaluation? B¨urohengst ‘pencil pusher’: yes; Haﬂingerhengst ‘Haﬂinger stallion’: no.

• Head Intensity: does the head (i.e. the potential afﬁxoid) contribute an intensifying meaning to the

overall word? Charmebolzen ‘highly charming person’: yes; Riesenbolzen ‘giant bolt’: no.

• Head Polarity: does the head of the complex word contribute an evaluating meaning to the overall

word? Fußballgott ‘footballing god’: yes; Wettergott ‘weather god’: no.

5 Experiments

5.1 Automatically extracted features

Our experimental set-up is as follows. We perform a 5-fold cross validation. Our data is initially ran-
domized before we deﬁned folds that are held constant across all experiments. For our experiments,

8Valence and arousal are part of (Osgood et al., 1957)’s well-known theory of emotions.
9We tested agreement only for polarity of the complex word. Here, two annotators achieved a kappa of 0.86 on a random

sample of 200 items.

we convert the instances of B(oth) to instances of Y, i.e. afﬁxoid uses. The seven instances that the
annotators had left as unsure are excluded from the experiments. We use the automatically extractable
features discussed in §4.1. As our classiﬁer, we use SVM (Vapnik, 1995), as implemented by SVMlight
(Joachims, 1998). Note that we experimented with the cost-factor, by which training errors on positive
examples (i.e. examples of class Y) outweight errors on negative examples (i.e. examples of class N).
However, modifying it only helped in the lowest-performing conﬁgurations where we would otherwise
perform exactly like the majority baseline. Table 5 reports results for the different features obtained
with the default settings of SVMlight. The majority baseline we report represents a classiﬁer that always
predicts non-afﬁxoid as this is the majority class for each sufﬁxoid and the dataset as a whole.

Table 5: Results for classiﬁcation experiments per feature group; setting: 5-fold CV
The bag of supersenses is the best feature group and notably better than paying attention only to

differences between second component and complex word in terms of supersenses.

5.2 Automatic features in balanced setting

The difference in performance between the two classes that we found when using all data (cf. §5.1)
might be due either to the class imbalance or come about because the majority class N is inherently
easier to learn. In order to tease this apart, we here repeat the previous experiment using all features in
a 5-fold cross-validation setting, however this time with a balanced dataset of 970 items. The dataset
is constructed so that each fold contains the same number of instances per sufﬁxoid and those instances
are themselves balanced equally across the afﬁxoid and non-afﬁxoid classes.10 As Table 6 shows, with
balanced data we can obtain much more balanced performance on the two classes. And despite the fact
that we are using only 54.3% of the available data, the overall F1-score (0.73) is more or less tied with
the result obtained on all data (0.74).

5.3 Feature ablation experiments

Table 7 shows an ablation experiment using all data. We remove one particular feature from the entire
feature set at a time. The table shows that the performance decreases only marginally for most removed
features, which indicates that most features encode information. The largest performance drop is caused
by removing supersenses, which suggests that this is the feature with the most unique information.

Since the supersense feature is both the strongest individual feature (cf. Table 5) and also the feature
encoding most unique information (cf. Table 7), we further examined this feature by listing the top 10
supersenses according to χ2 ranking as shown in Table 8. The most predictive supersenses are predom-
inantly those of the ﬁrst component of the compound or those of the (complex) compound form itself.
This ﬁrst component is very helpful, for instance, for K¨onig. Its non-afﬁxoid uses (e.g. Sarazenenk¨onig
’king of the Saracens’) mostly co-occur with a ﬁrst component denoting a Location or a nationality

10These latter two constraints result in only 970 items being used rather than 984, if we simply used all 492 instances of class

Y and added as many instances from class N.

Table 7: Ablation experiments where one feature is removed from the entire feature set

(Human) whereas its afﬁxoid uses typically involve Events (e.g. Tanzk¨onig ‘dancing king’) or artifacts
or objects (e.g. Schotterk¨onig ‘king of gravel’). The importance of the supersense of the whole word
arises in relation to the supersense of the second component. When the two differ for some of the af-
ﬁxoid candidates, the meaning of the whole word is usually only metaphorically related to the second
component. For instance, while Hai ‘shark’ and Hengst ‘stallion’ refer to Animals in their basic mean-
ing, complex forms in which they occur as afﬁxoids refer to Humans. Similarly, Bolzen refers to an
Artifact but complex forms containing an afﬁxoid use of it refer to Humans.

5.4 Cross-afﬁxoid generalization

Using the automatic features, we experiment with a setting where we train on the instances of all but one
afﬁxoid candidate and then test on the instances of the reamining afﬁxoid. For this experiment, we leave
out the lexical sufﬁxoid feature. Table 9 shows the results.

Table 9: Results for cross-afﬁxoid classiﬁcation, training on six afﬁxoids, testing on the remaining one;
all features except sufﬁxoid

The results show lower performance than in the cross-validation setting where we had instances of all
afﬁxoids in the train and the test folds. For k¨onig the results drop down as low as the majority baseline
in the present setting. However, the low result is very likely also heavily driven by the fact that the
instances of k¨onig make up close to 40% of our whole dataset. In other words, when testing on k¨onig,
we use only 60% of the dataset to train on. On the other hand, we also see lower results on afﬁxoids
such as bolzen that are much less frequent than k¨onig and for which we use more training instances in
the present generalization setting than we did in the cross-validation setting in §5.1. This suggests that
overall cross-afﬁxoid generalization may be somewhat limited.

5.5 Gold-quality manual features

The ﬁnal experiment we perform is a simple one: we use the manual features described in §4.3 and try
to predict whether the complex form is an afﬁxoid formation or not.
Table 10 shows that all features are highly predictive, with intensifying function of the sufﬁxoid being
the best. The results conﬁrm that afﬁxoids can be deﬁned in terms of intensiﬁcation and evaluation.

Table 11 shows confusion matrices per sufﬁxoid candidate and for all data cumulatively for the best
setting in our automatic experiments (cf. Table 5), in which all features were used in 5-fold cross valida-
tion. The breakdown per sufﬁxoid candidate reveals that the overall performance is strongly inﬂuenced
by K¨onig, which in particular contributes the bulk of the recall of true afﬁxoid formations.

Table 12 below shows the confusion matrix for the experiment with a balanced data set reported in
§5.2. As was to be expected based on the scores in Table 6, the performance across the different sufﬁxoids
is now much better. We can thus conclude that the difference in performance between the two classes
that we found when using all data is largely owed to the class imbalance and that the distinction between
afﬁxoid formations and non-afﬁxoid formations can in principle be learned for sufﬁxoids other than
K¨onig.

7 Conclusion

In this paper we studied German complex forms containing sufﬁxoid candidates. To do so, we con-
structed a new data set with 1788 items distributed about 7 potential afﬁxoid candidates, which we
make available to the research community. In one set of experiments we validated the high correlation
between evaluative and intensifying semantics and afﬁxoid status that has always been assumed by theo-
retical work but not demonstrated. In another experiment, we tackled the task of classifying our complex
forms as afﬁxoids formations or regular compounds. Being able to do so successfully can be useful
for sentiment analysis, as the afﬁxoid uses are typically evaluative. The task is difﬁcult, though, as we
have little reliable information about the complex forms available due to their low frequency. Still, we
achieved best results of 74% F1-score using a custom set of features, among which supersenses had the
most impact.

In future work, we plan on pursuing lines of research that we needed to leave open here. First, we
would like to cover more sufﬁxoid candidates and also extend this work to preﬁxoid formations. Second,
we want to tackle afﬁxoids that occur in complex adjectival forms. Finally, once we have annotated data
for further afﬁxoid candidates in hand, we would like to explore if it is possible to identify morphemes
that have afﬁxoid uses from properties of their formations, including their frequency distribution, and
distinguish them from morphemes that only participate in regular compounds. Since so far afﬁxoids
have been identiﬁed based on human introspection, we do not know how many of them actually exist in
German or other languages.

Michael Wiegand and Rebecca Wilm were partially supported by the German Research Foundation
(DFG) under grants WI 4204/2-1 and RU 1873/2-1. We would also like to thank Ulrich Heid for the
inspiration to study afﬁxoids.
